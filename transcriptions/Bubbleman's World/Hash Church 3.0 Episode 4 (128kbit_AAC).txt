[SPEAKER_08]: welcome welcome welcome is right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy smokes I guess I should acknowledge
that the channels back after six weeks of
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty much being hacked and controlled by
a Bitcoin scammer and now it seems as
[SPEAKER_08]: though the Videos are all gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna try and hope and get those
back.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the bottom line is the channels back
We've got the community and we're able to
[SPEAKER_08]: do hash church and these other shows and
Look, who's here at Tia Fontaine is in the
[SPEAKER_08]: house taking dabs.

[SPEAKER_08]: I Like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm I'm just happy really to be honest
just to have this friggin channel back and
[SPEAKER_08]: To be able to I can't really explain how
many ups and downs I went through in the
[SPEAKER_08]: six weeks with the channel because YouTube
never tells you anything They just don't
[SPEAKER_08]: communicate with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as your stuff is happening like You
know, they would at one point my videos
[SPEAKER_08]: started disappearing like they would
delete the hacker was deleting videos and
[SPEAKER_08]: then all of a sudden it was like all my
videos were just were deleted and then and
[SPEAKER_08]: then they were like your channels
terminated and then it was like
[SPEAKER_08]: permanently disabled and I was just like
every time it was this sort of insane
[SPEAKER_08]: experience of Is this gonna come back
together?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, did I freeze up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I good?
[SPEAKER_15]: Bring in everything but yeah, he does have
a little bit of static charge from time to
[SPEAKER_06]: time, but I Already thought you had the
path patented already there Sam and he's
[SPEAKER_13]: just got to pay for the patent,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I hope no one on my channel
sent that fucking guy Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really really
[SPEAKER_16]: Was laughing for hours Sam after you said
that on Friday couldn't stop thinking
[SPEAKER_08]: about that comment Was that right at the
end?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah I was dying.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great That wasn't sure wasn't sure
if it was hash church on Friday when we
[SPEAKER_08]: were doing hash talk, so he legitimately
three in the morning Which is only about a
[SPEAKER_08]: half an hour earlier than he normally
Still three in the morning is three in the
[SPEAKER_08]: morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh My goodness, where we got where's mr.
[SPEAKER_08]: Scaldone I saw him in the in the in the
Facebook chat earlier today.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah Just angry about who think we lost
somebody again
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we what were you talking about
there with that that hemp CBD blend and
[SPEAKER_06]: chat there Well, what it basically bowed
down to is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD synthase produces THC and about a 20
to 1 ratio of CBD to THC so Anybody who
[SPEAKER_06]: has a high CBD variety it's impossible to
have zero THC like they're claiming who's
[SPEAKER_06]: claiming this The Texas folks Know like
really Oh Texas meds Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to their website and looked at
their analysis tonight says this ain't
[SPEAKER_08]: right Well, I'll tell you one thing if
your spidey sense is going off there might
[SPEAKER_14]: be something there Yeah, that's pretty
much a given There's dr. Scaldone Hey
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody, sorry, I had some computer
difficulty there, I think I'm good Was
[SPEAKER_08]: that your impression impersonation of a
Canadian?
[SPEAKER_08]: Came in and said sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was like, sorry Right immediately
apologizing right very Canadian dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hey, I wanted to get my avatar here
[SPEAKER_08]: Show one day where everyone has an avatar
even though like most of you already do
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he's not really an avatar.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just a stuffed animal He's a Jerry
good friend.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: First.
[SPEAKER_09]: See ya.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here.
[SPEAKER_09]: See you later How are you Marcus?
[SPEAKER_09]: Great to be back, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, honestly, I'm pretty Pretty stoked
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that I ever took it for granted,
but I just never thought I always had the
[SPEAKER_08]: worry like oh Maybe YouTube won't like the
content one day and they'll take it down
[SPEAKER_08]: But I never really thought I'd get caught
with my pants down and and get sucked into
[SPEAKER_08]: a phishing scam and a phishing scam that
was able to have two-factor authentication
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wasn't just that I clicked on a
button and it got into my YouTube it went
[SPEAKER_08]: through my YouTube into my Gmail
Authenticated itself went back to YouTube
[SPEAKER_08]: and then and I was in Whistler at the time
on my phone Had I been at a computer?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I could have stopped it because he
needed to go He needed to change the name
[SPEAKER_08]: about three times.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he changed the name three times
and on the third time He removed me as the
[SPEAKER_08]: owner So each time it would change it
would say you are now the owner of YS
[SPEAKER_08]: computers You are now the owner of Ken
lock.
[SPEAKER_08]: You are now the owner of and bit finance
English The worst thing about it but
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus was that it took all the photos
that you have all your naked photos on
[SPEAKER_06]: your on your your Telephone and emailed
them to me What No, I'm joking So it's
[SPEAKER_13]: gonna cost you Bitcoin to get rid of those
pictures on the internet, you know It's
[SPEAKER_08]: funny it's so many people like right now
there's a guy In the chat like oh two
[SPEAKER_08]: factor.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's someone you pissed off,
bro It's like no, it wasn't a conspiracy
[SPEAKER_08]: like people were like, oh someone bubble
man was Got upset.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like no, man It was a phishing scam
that he sends out to tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_08]: emails and if you Google this finance
English guy He hacked hundreds if not a
[SPEAKER_08]: thousand plus YouTube channels.
[SPEAKER_08]: They wrote about it in Forbes magazine It
was actually a pretty big thing and I
[SPEAKER_08]: suspect it rocked YouTube pretty good
because from what I know Two-factor
[SPEAKER_08]: authentication is not supposed to be
easily hacked So the hack itself is of
[SPEAKER_08]: value the websites are of value because
you can sell them on the dark web And I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: not sure if the guy who did the Bitcoin on
my website Hacked the page or if he was a
[SPEAKER_08]: guy that bought the site on the dark web
to do that Bitcoin scam So these are all
[SPEAKER_08]: the little things I found out about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty crazy They're definitely
getting smarter and smarter Jay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Henricks.
[SPEAKER_09]: The hackers are getting smarter It shows
you how vulnerable our whole system is
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean we all use you know credit card
information and phones and computers and
[SPEAKER_09]: and even though if you don't think that
you know doing it on your own phone when
[SPEAKER_09]: you Call your credit card number into
somebody there's just somebody on the
[SPEAKER_09]: other end of the phone Typing that
information into a computer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, you can buy those numbers on the
dark web as well You can buy credit card
[SPEAKER_08]: numbers and all you they get machines with
blank cards And they they punch the the
[SPEAKER_08]: the numbers into the card.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I know and Marcus it was great to
hear on your little brief video that you
[SPEAKER_09]: did How helpful YouTube ended up being in
the long run, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I mean here we are Yeah, exactly And
I still think there's a good possibility
[SPEAKER_08]: that one day we're gonna wake up and all
the videos are gonna be back on the
[SPEAKER_08]: channel Now for those of you that are all
freaking out about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a good solid idea 80 plus percent
the ones I didn't recall the videos I
[SPEAKER_08]: recorded and edited with Johnny B and d4
20k those are Those are all saved now the
[SPEAKER_08]: videos of hash church.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saved about 80% of them I missed that
like from 130 on to the end of episode 1
[SPEAKER_08]: and then all of this the twos and the
threes I don't have but it seems like
[SPEAKER_08]: People who watch the show do have them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been sent some incredible lists of
people That have ripped all these great
[SPEAKER_08]: shows off the channel So I would say we're
probably sitting in the high 90s for
[SPEAKER_08]: content that was created on this channel
It's it'll end up back on the channel if I
[SPEAKER_08]: have to upload it all again I don't really
care about the views and whatnot But the
[SPEAKER_08]: the content was valuable and it's amazing
how many people have hit me up and been
[SPEAKER_08]: like Where's the video we did together?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that's my bread and butter like what
happened to that video?
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't regret I'm gonna get them back
what you need to do Marcus is post List of
[SPEAKER_06]: the ones that you don't have exactly but I
kind of Everybody else will chip in and I
[SPEAKER_06]: bet you'll get a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah Yeah, I bet you 99 to 100% wouldn't
surprise me at all people love the the
[SPEAKER_15]: content and the information So and again,
we did it all out of love, you know None
[SPEAKER_15]: of us are getting paid here every
everything that we're doing is just trying
[SPEAKER_15]: to pass it on to y'all because we all have
this information and knowledge in our head
[SPEAKER_15]: that does us no good sitting here,
so Thank you Marcus for be giving us a
[SPEAKER_17]: vessel for us all to sail on so that we
could Send a brother a Bitcoin come on
[SPEAKER_06]: help a brother out there cut us in man I
was surprised to hear they're worth about
[SPEAKER_06]: $8,000 each now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah for real Jesus maybe I should have
listened to that crazy guy That told me to
[SPEAKER_08]: buy bitcoins when they were $39 Yeah,
well, maybe maybe a little bong rip is in
[SPEAKER_08]: order Jay Hendrix you guys do this shit
for free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we do it for free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, welcome D for 20k.
[SPEAKER_08]: I Can't hear you I Don't hear Darren does
anyone hear Darren?
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I hear Darren.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just heard him.
[SPEAKER_16]: I hear Darren.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good fuck this new stuff that I Try
to keep up with it man, but I you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have problems and it's a struggle just
to get on this video and You're guilty
[SPEAKER_02]: man, I am guilty of everything Everything
you want to accuse me of I am guilty
[SPEAKER_02]: guilty of being awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir Bung rip everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you D.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I was waiting for.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it So Marcus just for a second
and all your dealings with the folks at
[SPEAKER_09]: YouTube Did the content of the channel
come up?
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that just not an issue or I mean at
times it had to at least you know Create a
[SPEAKER_09]: chuckle just about you know what it was
about right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, well, I mean these the YouTube
monetized my channel for years They only
[SPEAKER_08]: pulled my monetization out not too long
ago, which I'm really glad because that
[SPEAKER_08]: connected it to a bank account.
[SPEAKER_08]: So They had cut that off before I got
hacked dude, so and it wasn't a huge
[SPEAKER_08]: monetization but over the years they just
definitely sent me tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_08]: dollars and so I I was the only cannabis
website YouTube channel that I know of
[SPEAKER_08]: that was monetized Remo Johnny no one else
got monetized.
[SPEAKER_08]: They monetized mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea why I never wanted to rock
the boat But in all my dealings with
[SPEAKER_08]: YouTube guess how many times I actually
spoke with someone from YouTube
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't email me they are ghosts So
what they do is they send you first of all
[SPEAKER_08]: you get in touch Google one and you're
like, oh my god, my channel's gone and
[SPEAKER_08]: they're like, okay Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_08]: The team at YouTube is gonna help you out
and I'm like, oh, thank you And then I'd
[SPEAKER_08]: write them back and they'd they'd be like
this is what you have to do You have to
[SPEAKER_08]: get your account recovered.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go through and do screenshots
of every single Email and every time he
[SPEAKER_08]: changed the page and all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to start a thread over on the
YouTube Help Center Well, nobody from
[SPEAKER_08]: YouTube ever answers you on the thread
instead Random nerds that work that don't
[SPEAKER_08]: work at YouTube that just go on the
website Like, you know when you're on over
[SPEAKER_08]: grow calm certain people shine you could
ask certain people for ganja growing You
[SPEAKER_08]: could ask certain people for hash making
but they didn't own over grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't work for over grow They
weren't a part of over grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were just rando people That's who
helps you at YouTube So I got this guy
[SPEAKER_08]: named at Eric Parker who was a gold
product expert and he came in and said
[SPEAKER_08]: look you gotta Recover your account.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to do all this stuff start the
thread I started the thread and like every
[SPEAKER_08]: two weeks he would be like, oh You know,
sorry, we couldn't confirm hijacking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like really like my face in all 1016
videos doesn't like get let you know that
[SPEAKER_08]: these are my videos No, no, we got to do
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to do it all again.
[SPEAKER_08]: It took two and a half hours More weeks
and it's super random and you don't really
[SPEAKER_08]: know what you're doing and you're jumping
through hoops But you're not sure if
[SPEAKER_08]: you're supposed to jump through this hoop
or that hoop and finally I did it again
[SPEAKER_08]: and like two weeks later the Eric Parker
guy comes back and he says Hijacking has
[SPEAKER_08]: been confirmed He puts up a link and he
says click on this link and it'll take you
[SPEAKER_08]: to your your email page Which has now been
given that YouTube channel again and start
[SPEAKER_08]: The other confusing thing is that my
YouTube channel isn't from my email.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a sub channel That's a brand channel.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my actual email Fresh head ease at
whatever is the YouTube channel,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I've never put content on it It has
its own Google one page, but it has no
[SPEAKER_08]: content but under that page is the bubble
man brand bubble bubble man's world the
[SPEAKER_08]: YouTube page that we all do this on so
Basically, I started another bubble man's
[SPEAKER_08]: brand once they gave me access confirmed
hijacking locked the account that the guy
[SPEAKER_08]: was hacking and What you know,
I thought they were just gonna Migrate
[SPEAKER_08]: everything over but instead it was more
convoluted all the videos got deleted then
[SPEAKER_08]: my then the channel I started was was was
disabled for impersonation So I think
[SPEAKER_08]: people saw the new channel and were like,
oh someone's trying to impersonate bubble
[SPEAKER_08]: man And they reported it a bunch and so
they they disabled the new one as well It
[SPEAKER_06]: just kept just kept going and Marcus why
did they do it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Were they trying to get bitcoins?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that the basic reason?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well what what Eric told me was that
there's a variety of reasons you can hack
[SPEAKER_08]: these accounts and I got a few emails From
people and I'm guessing because my email
[SPEAKER_08]: was attached to the information that they
put up on the dark web But I found out
[SPEAKER_08]: that the website was for sale on the dark
web and I was getting offers for 90,000
[SPEAKER_08]: 100,000 110 thousand dollars to buy the
site to buy the hacked YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_06]: channel You should have sold it renamed
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think I think that's what the
hacker did I think he sold it and then it
[SPEAKER_08]: became I don't know exactly but in the end
we've got the channel back we get to
[SPEAKER_08]: gather and I'm just really happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't I'll never sell Bitcoin on this
channel So don't you ever see my channel
[SPEAKER_08]: doing anything than what we're doing right
now today Rest assured something is wrong
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some people that actually
thought I was behind that and was trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to scam people Not if you did it you would
have made bit hash coins exactly come on
[SPEAKER_06]: Bitcoins.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and is it aren't the hackers like
completely?
[SPEAKER_09]: Disconnected from finance.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean totally totally Yeah, finance is a
big company a really big company and
[SPEAKER_09]: they're they're all over the place So,
I mean they have a million Twitter
[SPEAKER_09]: followers, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So so it's Likely that that they've been
hacked too as well, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean just the fact that they're using
your name Yeah, and I don't even know if
[SPEAKER_08]: the videos they showed on my channel were
actual by Nance videos or if they were
[SPEAKER_08]: because people were like are those the
hackers on the channel right now because
[SPEAKER_06]: they're right now sent me an email I Right
after it happened to you a couple days
[SPEAKER_06]: after it happened to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I send an email to finance explaining and
I said we know who you are And they
[SPEAKER_06]: responded to me saying well, you know who
you think you we are but we're not the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones who did it they hacked us to Jesus
Christ a That's crazy Mother lovers once
[SPEAKER_08]: again Welcome Debbie to the room.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey Debbie We had a bad hack over here too
if they're hitting everyone in the
[SPEAKER_10]: industry somebody Managed to get a phone
number for one of my managers and Texted
[SPEAKER_10]: into them pretending to be me Told them
they need to take pictures of the safe and
[SPEAKER_10]: I needed the money right away There was a
big build on so much so they convinced my
[SPEAKER_10]: manager was actually me took pictures of
all of our money said it's the hacker
[SPEAKER_10]: Hacker sent a text saying yeah,
I'm coming to pick it up right now Like
[SPEAKER_10]: what the then she texted me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you texting me Tommy?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're coming to get all the money.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the fuck?
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, I'm not are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's industry wide man.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're coming after us Nothing happened
by the way the hackers were probably in
[SPEAKER_10]: like something there their whatsapp was
Mexico I would only say that the hack on
[SPEAKER_08]: me was a phishing scam.
[SPEAKER_08]: I I pushed an email I should not have I
don't think it was Cannabis focused to
[SPEAKER_08]: tens of thousands of people and when you
Google Binance English on YouTube So many
[SPEAKER_08]: pages come up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I Think he hacked a lot of pages and so
what you're saying is he just threw out a
[SPEAKER_06]: big giant net Look for a really stupid
fish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I was the stupidest I was just
like click I had two-factor authentication
[SPEAKER_08]: and on my cell phone I was like,
oh what if he's not gonna get me like my
[SPEAKER_08]: gmail and my YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Oh, yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, he did One of my other companies
This other hack that's going around the
[SPEAKER_10]: industry where they call and pretend to be
the boss They've even got the picture of
[SPEAKER_10]: the boss on the on the little thumbnail
and they're like, oh something's gone
[SPEAKER_10]: wrong I need you to wire me a hundred
dollars right away.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll pay you back and one of my companies
Yeah, two or three staff members responded
[SPEAKER_10]: to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: They thought it was so real So done a lot
of cyber training over the last Two months
[SPEAKER_10]: to prevent this stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really they're just coming after us
because we're trusting yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_16]: I've noticed small bills coming through my
email as well, but it's It's weird.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's yeah, they're small.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're like fifty seven dollars a hundred
dollars a couple hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Yeah It's it's going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've kind of around they've moved on
from the Nigerian princess Well,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I can remember even a decade ago
people would say I sent my company Bills
[SPEAKER_06]: an invoice for a bill, but I had I didn't
get any service I didn't they just sent
[SPEAKER_06]: millions of bills to everybody hoping a
few people would pay some And some did oh
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely That's why they keep doing it
gullible people everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's completely bonkers So did you guys
let's talk about hashish?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'd love to it's one of my favorite
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you like?
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, who's going to be the first
one to make pure dry sip?
[SPEAKER_06]: TCP?
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably that that's a couple of cards to
own you're gonna a need to have the
[SPEAKER_08]: variety and to be able to grow it But then
you're also going to be needing the
[SPEAKER_08]: techniques and the skills to isolate those
heads without the help of water to ninety
[SPEAKER_14]: nine point nine percent So you've already
patented this right Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's already done I was gonna say
the same.
[SPEAKER_16]: So how many bitcoins man?
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a thought though, yeah,
it really is you know, do you now do we
[SPEAKER_16]: believe?
[SPEAKER_06]: The other funny thing well, I have no idea
I don't even know how the plant makes it
[SPEAKER_09]: It's isn't it t8 CPA Yes, yes So I think
it's identifying it where identifying
[SPEAKER_06]: where the Italian army grew it in Italy
and the plant that they isolated it from
[SPEAKER_06]: and the amounts were like You know Point
zero zero zero one or something.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the name of the genetic?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam right they didn't tell you the name
they it was something like MD12 or it was
[SPEAKER_15]: just a clone number a number letter
Nomenclature gotcha.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's it No, I think that there
might be other varieties they just ought
[SPEAKER_09]: to look for it, you know now that they
know No, I'm just saying that now that
[SPEAKER_09]: They know that that compound exists.
[SPEAKER_09]: It probably is just part of that
Unassigned fraction of what's always been
[SPEAKER_09]: in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like what the fuck you absolutely
could be correct But nothing But I think
[SPEAKER_06]: what they isolated it was from a hemp
variety, but another percent sure and if
[SPEAKER_06]: they isolated it from a variety that had
any THC Then the THC no matter how little
[SPEAKER_06]: there was
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike West is in the chat right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah hemp fiber varietal I would have to
ask Mike West how he knows that but he
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't usually open his mouth unless he
knows the stuff that he's talking about I
[SPEAKER_06]: read that there's three or four different
papers on the group that they isolated
[SPEAKER_06]: also CBD be a and THC be a along with THCP
and CB THCP is like sounds too much like
[SPEAKER_13]: PCP Does the TCPA come from the CBG does
that where it starts from No, no,
[SPEAKER_09]: because it has to have a different
biosynthetic pathway because its tail is
[SPEAKER_09]: longer right cannabinoids have a c5 tail
and this has got a c7 tail So it's just
[SPEAKER_09]: it's just a different product,
but it's out of the same biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_09]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, it should have a Acid group
there just like you know THC and THCV All
[SPEAKER_09]: those have an acid group right THCV is
only got a three carbon tail Right THC has
[SPEAKER_09]: got the five carbon tail.
[SPEAKER_09]: This has got the seven carbon tail,
you know again It'd be interesting is if
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a nine carbon tail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are all odd numbers of carbons
because of the bias is a three carbon
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right because that biosynthetic
pathway Sort of puts things together two
[SPEAKER_09]: carbons at a time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so Does this mean there's probably a
third then endocannabinoid receptor for
[SPEAKER_15]: this?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that again I don't have any data
to support this but I I think that this is
[SPEAKER_09]: just again part of that other unknown
fraction of Cannabinoids that we do
[SPEAKER_09]: extract that's just part of that,
you know again if you look at a really
[SPEAKER_09]: Well made live resin extract.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be something like 80% cannabinoids
You know 10% terpenes maybe 12% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that other 7% of stuff that's in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that compounds like this and the
flavonoids and CB1 antagonist in How
[SPEAKER_09]: they're gonna react biologically I have no
idea They've already looked at them.
[SPEAKER_09]: They said it gets you 43% higher so I
Would I would put that in a sort of grain
[SPEAKER_09]: of salt, you know kind of thing because
when you model something on a computer
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, what they're doing is they're sort
of looking at there's a crystal structure
[SPEAKER_09]: known of the receptor site so that's sort
of like the the lock and they're sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: modeling the key fitting in the Lock and
yeah, sometimes that's really Predictive
[SPEAKER_09]: of how potent it's going to be but if
that's truly the case we wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_09]: human disease today because all disease
would be solved because that Methods been
[SPEAKER_09]: around for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called rational drug design.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you can perform rational drug
design, but drug delivery and Metabolism
[SPEAKER_09]: and all kinds of other things complicates,
you know making you know Just lock and key
[SPEAKER_09]: fits to say look that's going to be 30
times more potent.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think I'll just finish by just
saying that I think what it says is that
[SPEAKER_09]: The hydrophobic promiscuity of that area
of the receptor is rich for making analogs
[SPEAKER_09]: like that And if you know about navinoid
analogs like the dimethyl Heptal Analogs,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's where they put two methyl groups
adjacent to the benzene ring.
[SPEAKER_09]: And these were a series of analogs That
were made they have JWH numbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if that means they were
made at Johns Hopkins or whatever whatever
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's John Huffman.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh John Huffman.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so those compounds there again sort
of probed the notion that that end of the
[SPEAKER_09]: receptor is kind of Got room that can
accommodate Larger groups and you could
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of branch out and make different
analogs of the naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_09]: compounds that could basically make a
tighter fit in the receptor and perhaps
[SPEAKER_09]: enhance its potency.
[SPEAKER_15]: But ultimately, either way, you could make
it stronger or weaker dependent ring.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that shorter case make it weaker.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam, if I remember correctly, didn't that
group also show some efficacy in mice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely binding in rat brains or
mouse brains or something.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, I think what it says is
that again, it's probing the notion of,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, like what Russo and Mishul and
[SPEAKER_09]: THCA and you did a dab of that versus a
60% THCA with the right mix of terps and
[SPEAKER_09]: other compounds in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just a complete difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how you feel when you consume those
extracts, which I would say subjectively
[SPEAKER_06]: almost twice as strong.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: A wonderful ensemble effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, isn't that what the cannabis
plant teaches us, which now we have to
[SPEAKER_09]: teach the FDA that look, it's not just
CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's matters that the FDA actually just
released a statement on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_09]: They really encourage interested parties
to develop safety data to show that it's
[SPEAKER_09]: okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're basically saying that,
you know, they're asking for data.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're looking for the data.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're looking for data to show that
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a lot of side effects of
meloxicam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Meloxicam affects a huge swath of the
population.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anyway, the impact of a CBD
medication that she was taking,
[SPEAKER_09]: they think led to this toxic reaction of
the meloxicam in the liver, which actually
[SPEAKER_09]: led to her death.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not saying that CBD caused the
death, but CBD's impact on the liver
[SPEAKER_09]: metabolism of a pretty toxic and known
drug to have several side effects then
[SPEAKER_09]: basically led to her passing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's like one of those things,
again, where I think the FDA has just got
[SPEAKER_09]: to try to get their arms around exactly
how to regulate this in the right way to
[SPEAKER_09]: make sure that they're operating in an
area that certainly puts the safety of
[SPEAKER_09]: people first, but certainly works with the
industry to develop safety data to show
[SPEAKER_09]: that, you know, taking these things aren't
going to lead to...
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need to know what patient you're
taking, what kind of medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime someone asks me for some guidance
on using CBD, I always tell them if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're on any pharmaceutical drugs to
talk to the doctor that prescribed those
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs and make sure that there's not going
to be an interaction there that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's two reasons to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the doctors need to know more about
what their patients are doing and the
[SPEAKER_01]: effects that cannabis are having on their
treatment options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, to avoid the exact scenario that
Mark just described, where someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical prescribed drug accumulates
in the blood to the point where it can
[SPEAKER_01]: kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I first saw this with seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the folks I was... A young person I
was helping with was on some other
[SPEAKER_01]: medications and their seizures actually
got worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully the parents had the
foresight, if you will, to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: child's blood tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, they had a really high
concentration of one of their prescribed
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs in their bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, a lot of patients are on,
you know, diabetes medications,
[SPEAKER_09]: blood pressure medications.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, these are medications that are
helping them stay alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't mean that they can't take
cannabinoids and supplement their health
[SPEAKER_09]: by supplementing with cannabinoids,
especially, again, speaking to Ethan
[SPEAKER_09]: Russo's theory of endocannabinoid
deficiency, sort of you picture that the
[SPEAKER_09]: body's own pharmaceutical company is the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it needs to be nurtured in such a way
that your body can fight off all of these
[SPEAKER_09]: viruses and diseases and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you don't have to take things like
Veloxicam.
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget exactly what she was taking
Veloxicam for, but I know that it's a
[SPEAKER_09]: pretty natural nasty drug.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of those NSAIDs, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory agents.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think in the GW Pharma clinical
trials, this liver toxicity thing was
[SPEAKER_09]: observed again in patients that were on,
you know, any number of medications,
[SPEAKER_09]: whether it's for diabetes or for blood
pressure.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, if they have these existing
conditions, exactly what you're saying,
[SPEAKER_09]: Wade, is that, you know, you can't not
make people aware of this because they
[SPEAKER_09]: have to understand the impact of what
they're taking into their body and their
[SPEAKER_09]: own body's genetics and their ability to,
you know, detoxify themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe cannabinoids do have a
peripheral effect that certainly are gonna
[SPEAKER_09]: interact with any other pharmaceuticals
that you're taking and, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: take it with caution, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of the- What CBD acts like is
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you drink grapefruit or eat grapefruit,
it can really fuck with some medications
[SPEAKER_06]: my wife was taking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really causes problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And CBD almost does the identical thing
with that particular case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you're pharmaceutical,
one of the other things you can do for
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who's on pharmaceutical drugs is
have them look at the sheet that describes
[SPEAKER_01]: potential side effects and all of that,
the boiler plate that comes with every
[SPEAKER_01]: medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it says somewhere on there,
do not take this medication with
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit juice, it likely has an
interaction with CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if it's the grapefruit terpenes
like Nucatone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nucatone is a sesquiterpenoid that's sort
of like the essential oil component of
[SPEAKER_09]: grapefruit that's got that real grapefruit
smell.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it occurs in cannabis,
Nucatone, and that's similar to a few
[SPEAKER_09]: different other citrus type of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I wonder if those are the terpenes
that actually have some effect or if it's
[SPEAKER_09]: just generally the acidity, you know,
because there is a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: citrate and other- It's fucking with the
enzyme that speeds up or breaks down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the core problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what my wife was having.
[SPEAKER_06]: Her doctor never told her that this
medication should not be taken with
[SPEAKER_06]: grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: She used to drink grapefruit juice every
morning until she found out.
Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn, I miss these conversations.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I was just thinking because I was in
the hospital taking all the pharma and
[SPEAKER_18]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to eat a lot of grapefruits and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just listening to all of this and
trying to kind of go back in the memory of
[SPEAKER_18]: when I was on all the pharma and trying to
take all the cannabinoids and trying to
[SPEAKER_18]: get off all of that.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm trying to really think about
that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, wouldn't it be making you
nauseous, sick, stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I'm trying to think of the side
effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was muted.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking and it was muted.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was going to tell you,
but I was muted too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for muting when you're not
talking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're not talking, just mute that
shit up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's courtesy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the THCP thing we were talking
about a few minutes ago, that's something
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've been thinking a lot about
because working off the analytical results
[SPEAKER_01]: we've had for years where we mostly just
looked at tea and THC, CBD, and a few
[SPEAKER_01]: other of the cannabinoids, I always went
with the assumption that the differences
[SPEAKER_01]: we saw in high THC varieties had to do
with the terpenes, the differences in the
[SPEAKER_01]: response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some THC varieties, you want to go
dancing or go finish that fence you were
[SPEAKER_01]: building or write a song.
[SPEAKER_01]: And others, it's like you're locked into
the couch and you can't even muster enough
[SPEAKER_01]: energy to reach over and grab the remote
so you don't have to watch a commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet the cannabinoids are pretty much
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think maybe that that couch
lock phenomenon, probably those cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: likely have some THCP in them,
but because we don't have the standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: The amounts found are so small that even
if it was there, you wouldn't feel it
[SPEAKER_06]: really.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's like one hundredth of the
amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was my next question in terms of the
cultivars that they grab this from.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are these really recessive traits that
we're really looking at, guys,
[SPEAKER_16]: and are they recessive traits?
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody knows how the plant produces it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you don't know how the plant is
producing it, you can't tell the traits
[SPEAKER_06]: are recessive or dominant or what.
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, that's good info.
[SPEAKER_16]: So because it came from a fiber,
because it came from a fiber plant,
[SPEAKER_16]: it leads me to kind of look at it in the
way that the plant shifted its energy and
[SPEAKER_16]: it focused on these recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because let's face it, fiber hemp is
predominantly non-cannabinoid forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just produces smaller amounts of
different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, OK, that's what I really that's
thank you for.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and that's what I meant to say from
from allotolvic acid, right, which have
[SPEAKER_09]: the C5 tail.
[SPEAKER_09]: This has got two extra carbons.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just another compound that
whatever the allotolvic acid plus two
[SPEAKER_09]: carbon trivial name for that acid is is is
what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's being terminated.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the same way, and they build the other
side of the molecule in the same way.
[SPEAKER_09]: This thing just has a C7 tail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Terpenylated.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they could probably they'll be able
to do this in yeast.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be able to pull this off in yeast
because they already have the rest of that
[SPEAKER_09]: pathway already cloned.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sticking with flour.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just telling you what the rest of the
world's going to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just found a moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: I put some smiles down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bakers couldn't do without yeast.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on what kind of baking you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're waking, baking, you can do it
without yeast all day long, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Depends on if you need to rise and shine.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rise and shine on the way can bake time to
make the donuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite bread was always extra sour
dough from the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm being told that's from the air.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's terrible bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrible bread is terrible, but the bread
is good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there's a lot of biology to that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll take New Orleans French bread over
anything any day.
[SPEAKER_18]: So as we're sitting here talking,
I'm looking at I got some profiles from a
[SPEAKER_18]: strain called MediLights that I did back
in the days.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's
[SPEAKER_18]: So Johnny, if you add up all the numbers
there, what's left?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's not known?
[SPEAKER_09]: And that extract, if you add up all those
numbers, what is the what does the number
[SPEAKER_09]: come up to?
[SPEAKER_09]: Ninety four point four nine percent.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so there's still like five point
something percent unknown.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unknown.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it could it could have been unknown
or it could have been compounds like CBC
[SPEAKER_06]: or CBCV that they weren't testing for or
TACP.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: TACPA.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that could be part of like that five
percent is probably just a really small
[SPEAKER_09]: fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's 30 to 60 times stronger
than THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think even at really small
amounts, 30 times, I've never read 60,
[SPEAKER_06]: only 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought I saw in the paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, well, I read the expert.
[SPEAKER_06]: I read the the science papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yeah, no, I did, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I've been reading a lot of
papers recently and I read it as 30 as
[SPEAKER_14]: well.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it appeared is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's speculation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everybody thought pure THC would be
the strongest thing you could smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like Mark said earlier, you know,
it's not if you get half a 50 percent THC
[SPEAKER_06]: and spike it with the right terpenes,
it's stronger.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I agree with Wade.
[SPEAKER_15]: It has to the THCPA must exist at such a
very small, finite manufacturing on the
[SPEAKER_15]: plant, because if it had been in a larger
form, we would have way discovered it by
[SPEAKER_15]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would have already had a variety.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was about to say you would already had
it on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Pat.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I wanted to ask Sam.
[SPEAKER_16]: So do you think that now that we kind of
have somewhat of a glimpse into the into
[SPEAKER_16]: the light, so to speak, do you think we
can go back and look at that other test
[SPEAKER_16]: results and be able to kind of navigate
those test results to identify these same
[SPEAKER_16]: spikes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think Mark would be able to answer
that better than me.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a more analytical guy than me.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I'm not really that analytical.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, I think that like the question
you're asking is, is THCP hasn't been
[SPEAKER_09]: there all along, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you're asking?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, essentially.
[SPEAKER_09]: So so it'd be cool if see the cool thing
about this paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the one good thing is like there are
like 11 people on the paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what we call a football team
paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: When when you put 11 people on a project,
you can get shit done.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had the Italian military,
you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, again, I don't know if it's just a
coincidence, but Italy is the only country
[SPEAKER_09]: outside of China that's got the highest
rate of coronavirus infection.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they're related or
probably not.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Dr. Skeldon, do you think that the
THCPA and it's oh, I lost my train of
[SPEAKER_15]: thought.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the cool thing, let me finish my
train of thought and then yours will come
[SPEAKER_09]: back.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the cool thing is that so not only did
they identify it, but then they also made
[SPEAKER_09]: it synthetically to create a standard.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that way they can, you know,
then if they made it synthetically,
[SPEAKER_09]: they know what they started with.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't just, you know, remove two
carbons from that tail or add two carbons.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they started with a starting material,
not all of the tall, but whatever the two
[SPEAKER_09]: carbon homolog of all of the tall.
[SPEAKER_09]: As somebody will find it in the chat of
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that compound there, they reacted to
basically put on the other part of the
[SPEAKER_09]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they made it synthetically so they can
identify it in the mixture of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a long way of answering the
question.
[SPEAKER_09]: So once we have a synthetic source of it,
hopefully people will find value in making
[SPEAKER_09]: the material pure as an analytical
standard.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those analytical standards cost a whole
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like 500 bucks for like a one make
per mil solution.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's only like one milliliter.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're only getting this small little,
you know, dilute sample of material.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's got to be dilute to be,
you know, harmonious with the DEA,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, what they allow being purchased
and sent through the mail.
[SPEAKER_09]: But those analytical standards are
absolutely required to then go back and
[SPEAKER_09]: look at all the, you know, extracts and
stuff and see if those cannabinoids are in
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe they're in there and maybe
they're not, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I would think that maybe,
you know, if there were analytical
[SPEAKER_09]: standards for them, now we can assign what
those bumps in the baseline were that add
[SPEAKER_09]: up to that collective, you know,
5% of unknowns that's in jobs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I making sense?
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: My question was regarding if THC of course
causes paranoia, especially in high
[SPEAKER_15]: dosages that it can, what will THCPA do
then?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think THC causes paranoia.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the laws against THC cause
paranoia.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the laws that cause paranoia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people smoke THC, get way too high
and think they're going to be like that
[SPEAKER_06]: tomorrow when they have to go to work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, like, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, do you guys remember Mishulam's
video?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like when they made the cake and they gave
it out to people and some people really
[SPEAKER_09]: enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people didn't stop talking just like
when people get high and one person got
[SPEAKER_09]: really paranoid and got really upset and
thought that people were looking at her
[SPEAKER_09]: differently or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yeah, that happens to some people
in the population.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think like a lot of different biological
triggers in the body.
[SPEAKER_09]: Things are like biphasic and they're
switches.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've always said that sometimes,
you know, when you're in the house,
[SPEAKER_09]: you need to have enough lights on in the
house so you can see, you don't have to
[SPEAKER_09]: have all the lights on all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so like in your body, you know,
I think that's the way your receptors work
[SPEAKER_09]: is that you have to sort of titrate
yourself where you are to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: who you can be and how you can be sort of
a level homeostasis with your body.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like when I go and I meet see with my
physician and he goes, oh, you're we're
[SPEAKER_09]: not we don't have you on drugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like they're needed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in homeostasis, you don't need
blood pressure medication or the statins
[SPEAKER_09]: or the other, you know, drugs that the
pharmaceutical companies want to feed
[SPEAKER_09]: somebody in my demographic, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I bring a variety that's 10 percent THC
that it should be in in theory,
[SPEAKER_06]: it should be, you know, 10 times stronger
than any cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's legal because it is not THC,
it's THCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is Sam.
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we even know what kind of strains are
high in THCP?
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we looking like cushions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I'm sending it to Italy
tomorrow to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, I can't wait to see it all,
see it all go down and see how this all
[SPEAKER_16]: progresses.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's it's fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's as a, you know, someone has been
spent their life with the plant and been
[SPEAKER_16]: watching your work, Sam.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it gets me really excited to
know that there's there's so much that we
[SPEAKER_16]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as much as we've we've found out,
you know, over the years, there's just a
[SPEAKER_16]: plethora of things that are exciting to
look into.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a highlight for I think a lot of
people right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a frontier.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a real frontier.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we've said is that,
you know, we've already known there's been
[SPEAKER_15]: and still needs to be, you know,
decades, even 100 years worth of research
[SPEAKER_15]: and studies that we have we've already
missed 70 plus.
[SPEAKER_15]: Years.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've already seen what we've known
anecdotally.
[SPEAKER_15]: And here we are still through the science
that we've only started, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: in the last few decades.
[SPEAKER_15]: What will we actually find?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's still very exciting.
[SPEAKER_15]: And to those who are watching it,
I'd be very excited to jump into science
[SPEAKER_15]: classes and learn that stuff so that when
I graduate, I could start going into this
[SPEAKER_15]: field and start discovering the actual
effects on the human receptor of THCPA,
[SPEAKER_15]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I mean, there's a whole other frontier.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right there, I guess, on research.
[SPEAKER_18]: I got another one here that actually gets
me a lot higher.
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel that to the crucial spectrum.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's told cannabinoids are 92.83.
[SPEAKER_18]: So as I'm sitting there thinking about
that, I don't know if yeah, that's why I
[SPEAKER_18]: asked what was the cushions.
[SPEAKER_18]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there is another new cannabinoid
recently discovered.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you guys see that?
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabinone or something like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually discovered it several years
ago, I think in 2000.
[SPEAKER_09]: Corresponding with Chimera on this because
I think Chimera knows the group in Italy
[SPEAKER_09]: that discovered it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I think they talked about the
compound, but it wasn't, okay,
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah, it's called
cannabimovone.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up with the Italians lately doing
all the awesome cannabis work,
[SPEAKER_15]: man?
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been absent for a while,
man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it though.
[SPEAKER_06]: The real truth is the reason the Italians
are doing this is because they've never
[SPEAKER_06]: looked at them closely.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: They saw that it was not very much THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: They never looked at them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they're using a super high pressure
HPLC where they can really, really,
[SPEAKER_06]: really see tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny amounts.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that also has a three chain as well,
Dr. Sheldon?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it has a five chain.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it comes from allotinic acid,
but it's not in the acid form in the
[SPEAKER_09]: paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know that's because a lot of
times when they identify these compounds,
[SPEAKER_09]: they shoot them on the GC.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they shoot it on the GC,
the acid's going to decarboxylate,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the GC is kind of like a hot
method.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is just a cool looking molecule,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's coming through.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you guys see that?
[SPEAKER_09]: To an organic chemist like me,
I see there's stereochemistry there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a benzene ring.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's all kinds of functionality there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Santa molecule.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ho, ho, ho.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, those hoes are hydroxyl
groups, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this CBD has got the two hoes on
the benzene ring.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what we call a resourcinol when
they're separated by a carbon.
[SPEAKER_09]: And rather than CBD, it has this really
crazy hydroxylated, let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you guys see that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Has this hydroxylated cyclopentane ring
that's got the same group that the CBD has
[SPEAKER_09]: in the methyl cyclopentene down there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's really cool because up here,
it's got a ketone.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why it's an oen, movone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what was that hanging at the bottom
there?
[SPEAKER_13]: My beard?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to ask about the steel your
face, but if that was part of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like when the steel your face showed up
and it just showed up and it looked like
[SPEAKER_08]: it was glowing.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's always present.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a steel your face from?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a reflection in your phone from
your computer screen.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some green.
[SPEAKER_09]: How funny is that, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Steel your face right off your head.
[SPEAKER_08]: It happened when your phone lost its
light.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when your phone had light, we couldn't
see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then your phone went half dark and then it
showed up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Blame it on Garcia.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a dark star.
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, I mean, here's another compound
that's found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think this is a group from Italy
and Chimera knows these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're Italians.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're Italians.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how cool is this that as analytical
chemistry basically intersects with what's
[SPEAKER_09]: going on with plant breeding today,
they're going to end up finding all the
[SPEAKER_09]: other compounds that are in these extracts
and potential things that can provide real
[SPEAKER_09]: untold therapeutic value and part of the
entourage effect, which is how we got
[SPEAKER_09]: started on this anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: Super cool for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Question on science.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could put it to the panel and maybe
people want to talk about this because
[SPEAKER_10]: it's a little off topic.
[SPEAKER_10]: But here I am at one of the only licensed
dad bars trying to figure out how not to
[SPEAKER_10]: spread coronavirus through shared
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all used to passing joints around
for tens of thousands of years and I tried
[SPEAKER_10]: to research because I'm in charge of
writing the policy and creating it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's almost nothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no science that I found that said
that there was disease being shared
[SPEAKER_10]: between cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I found nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what about the Wook flu?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, have you ever almost died at a
cannabis cup?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is true.
[SPEAKER_10]: At the cannabis cup man, I came home so
sick sometimes I literally had to go in a
[SPEAKER_10]: wheelchair to security one time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I couldn't find anything on how
to clean the rigs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's my question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody knows anything about how to clean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Alcohol will sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Time out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Time out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the alcohol is not enough because
you're also, this is the part we're not
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about, when the person takes the
rip and then coughs all over the place.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just like, we're not really
seeing what's coming out, but trust me,
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff's coming out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's why the Wook flu always gets you.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many years ago was it Sam that your
wife ended up in the bloody hospital after
[SPEAKER_08]: spandibus?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I damn near felt like I was dying for
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, half of the people I know
actually do get sick from sharing joints
[SPEAKER_06]: and sharing bombs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's plain simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens year after year after year.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't share anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right here is a thing called a mouthpiece
that's basically it's a silicone
[SPEAKER_15]: mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's universal on this side.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you basically can put it on any pipe
and it's for an individual to carry
[SPEAKER_15]: around.
[SPEAKER_15]: I implore people to get these,
especially if you're going to events and
[SPEAKER_15]: utilizing at events.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not putting your mouth on anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're just going and hitting it like
this.
[SPEAKER_15]: When it comes to cleaning pipes,
I highly recommend things like grunge off
[SPEAKER_15]: to soak your pipes to get especially if
you're doing dabbing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's one of the best things to get the
resin off.
[SPEAKER_15]: Usually can take a quick soak and then
more alcohol at first to get a lot of the
[SPEAKER_15]: large resin off and then get that out and
then use this as a finisher because this
[SPEAKER_15]: cleans the glass so it doesn't get milky.
[SPEAKER_08]: I soaked that shit overnight and then
rinse it and it's a perfect like it
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't matter how dirty the pipe is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just fill it up with grunge off,
put it in my cupboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: 24 hours later, I've poured the grunge off
back in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been using the same grunge off for
like, I mean, it's got to be eight years
[SPEAKER_08]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_15]: Put it through a coffee filter so you
don't get all that resin back in there,
[SPEAKER_15]: but you can restrain it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yours is, but at a dab bar, I think at a
minimum there has to be an alcohol wipe.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you think about it, someone just put
their mouth to that and now another
[SPEAKER_09]: person's going to put their mouth to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be just unheard of.
[SPEAKER_09]: To not do a cleaning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I said this, but we're
trying to teach people because our
[SPEAKER_10]: consumers have to be a part of the chain,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Use tissue if you cough and then sanitize
so you don't spit that stuff out
[SPEAKER_10]: everywhere, but then we're cleaning the
shit out of the table once you stand up,
[SPEAKER_10]: man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you were going to ask the more
interesting question to me, which is that
[SPEAKER_09]: if somebody is contaminated and I'm not
saying that somebody is, but let's say
[SPEAKER_09]: someone who comes in to your thing,
even if you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thermal imaging.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, let's just, okay, not your
place, Deb.
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone comes into a communal,
Deb.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're about to let that, that cruise
ship is about to unload in Oakland,
[SPEAKER_10]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of those people come to your place,
uses the thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The question is, is even with a wipe of
the thing, does it still risk
[SPEAKER_09]: contamination to the next individual who
uses that rig?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think again, I don't know the answer
to that question, but, and again,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what Marcus said is really
important, which is that after they take
[SPEAKER_09]: the rip, they can't be around to cough all
over the rig because now you're going to
[SPEAKER_09]: get it on the outside of the rig over by
the nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just going to be absolutely gross and
disgusting.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a, we couldn't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I looked at everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm scientific study.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's from Toledo.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on hookah pipes and they studied the
hookah pipes and surprise.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can spread germs using a hookah pipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: So because, and then so, so we can't have
a hazmat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, but I mean, really the fact is,
is that the dad bar is no different than
[SPEAKER_09]: the in and out burger that they just came
from, or the library that they're going to
[SPEAKER_09]: later, or any other public place.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we live in a microbial world.
[SPEAKER_09]: We microbes are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if you add up the entire mass of
microbes in the world, it's like thousands
[SPEAKER_09]: of times more than humans.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, yet I don't get the flu from
like burger joints, but I, I sure have
[SPEAKER_08]: gotten sick at some of these cannabis
cups, like a good percentage of them.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, yeah, I agree a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_16]: Marcus, I got every time I go to MJ biz or
any, any one of these, any of them,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's just, I try to wash my hands as much
as I can.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause the work flu is just so real.
[SPEAKER_16]: It just smashes here.
[SPEAKER_18]: With this virus looks scary, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: Debbie.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would also recommend keeping a spray
bottle with 91% alcohol to a hundred
[SPEAKER_15]: percent alcohol and sprayed on the outside
of the bongs as well and wipe them down
[SPEAKER_15]: after each use.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're soaking them all in alcohol.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're doing an alcohol soak of everything
in between use.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're doing a vigorous shake for two to
four minutes because we've learned that
[SPEAKER_10]: the air molecules and the alcohol are good
for dislodging that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're doing a hot water rinse.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wipe these out of the tables.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also have loosened our employee
policies.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have sick time.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are a paid sick time.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are a union shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you don't have to get a doctor's note
if you're sick, just don't go to the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't come to work, please.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also if you're over 65, don't use the
rigs.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've been to China or Italy,
don't use the rigs, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_10]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike West said alcohol will kill the
bacteria, but not as effective on the
[SPEAKER_08]: virus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Commercial dishwasher was steam
sterilization between uses.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to write that down.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was thinking about peroxide.
[SPEAKER_16]: What about a peroxide dunk for 15 minutes,
10, 15.
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you guys think about that?
[SPEAKER_16]: Or probiotics.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to say with virus, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it brings up an interesting point
around supply chain because, let's face
[SPEAKER_09]: it, a lot of the cannabis supply chain
hardware like vape pens come from China.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of stuff comes from China,
not just vape pen hardware.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, what is the impact of this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because again, I guess, yeah, can you
somehow do quality control measures to
[SPEAKER_09]: make sure that the stuff you're importing
from these places aren't going to
[SPEAKER_09]: contaminate your operation?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a crazy challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a real one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got out of hand a few times on this
earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as I know, nobody knows how long it
takes for somebody who's been exposed to
[SPEAKER_06]: the virus to have symptoms where it can be
tested.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is it one minute?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it one day?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't know how long it is once
they've got it before they're contagious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not going to go to any cannabis cups
in the very near future and share rigs
[SPEAKER_08]: with a thousand people.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about Alkanox?
[SPEAKER_15]: They use that to clean laboratory,
sterilize, you know, laboratory glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just a really good detergent.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, does it somehow denature the
virus?
[SPEAKER_09]: So you got to think about how a virus
works.
[SPEAKER_09]: A virus is just, it's not like a bacteria,
like it's not an organism.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like a bundle of DNA that
somehow gets into your cells and gets you
[SPEAKER_09]: viral infected.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, viruses are a bitch because our
immune system has really adapted great
[SPEAKER_09]: ways to basically combat them,
but they can mutate too as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a game of chess.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're playing with one another.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the notion again, that you could come
up with a vaccine for it in a small period
[SPEAKER_09]: of time is pretty dubious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of recognizing and
remembering that cannabis actually has
[SPEAKER_01]: antiviral properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really good to have the
conversation about how to reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a general thing, let's all remember
that the ECS, the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: is about keeping us healthy, keeping
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my belief to the center of me is that
cannabis can in fact help our immune
[SPEAKER_01]: systems identify this virus as an issue
and deal with it in the way that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved to deal with viruses before now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I've got.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Recently, a group from Canada showed good
antibacterial properties of CBG against
[SPEAKER_09]: MRSA, which is the strain of bacteria
that's resistant to or it's a resistant
[SPEAKER_09]: strain of staph.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I mean, I absolutely wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think our own body's chemistry is the
way that we fight off viruses because the
[SPEAKER_09]: old adage that a little dirt is good for
you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, getting sick as a kid and having
chicken pox and going through all the
[SPEAKER_09]: fevers and viruses that you had when you
were a kid kind of conditions your immune
[SPEAKER_09]: system, which is the most powerful
pharmaceutical company on the planet.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if your immune system is nurtured
through the nurturing of your
[SPEAKER_09]: endocannabinoid system, I do agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't you guys have chicken pox parties?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just talk about- When I was a kid,
I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You probably even had the music parties.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did that too.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had measles parties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring your kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: My kids got the measles.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give your kid the measles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring them on over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think vaccinations make a lot more sense
than measles parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my opinion.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I wanted to give a shout out to a
fallen friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: When my channel fell, I heard the news
that Subcool had passed away in the night.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have known Subcool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew Sub for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Originally, we just met online and through
the forums and eventually met at the
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably, geez, that would have been maybe
early to mid 2000s that he was around and
[SPEAKER_08]: doing his thing and just had a really
long, long friendship with him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know he caused all sorts of crazy vibes
sometimes in the community online and
[SPEAKER_08]: people loved him or hated him,
but I had love for Sub.
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing I always could guarantee was
if I got seeds or genetics from him that
[SPEAKER_08]: they would be full melt certified.
[SPEAKER_08]: The resin that would grow from those
plants would melt into a liquid and drip
[SPEAKER_08]: through the tightest of screens.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where my respect began for him
where all the quirkiness and the fun
[SPEAKER_08]: personality things were great.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the fact that he just produced great
genetics that always had really nice
[SPEAKER_08]: terpene content, the astro boy,
aka the watermelon, one of my favorites
[SPEAKER_08]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll miss that guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really sad to hear that he passed
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that right before he passed away,
he had some hard times again.
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy went through a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was incredible, some of the stuff that
he went through.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to puff a bowl.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's second Matt Marcus.
[SPEAKER_08]: To all the nerds out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: He continues to live on in the beautiful
genetics that everybody continues to grow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Grow beautifully and grow them with love
and spread them to others so that others
[SPEAKER_15]: may know this man's wonderful genetics
because we carried them, we sold them to
[SPEAKER_15]: patients for years.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was a quirky, amazing soul.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a sucker punch to the soul to hear
that he passed away in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_15]: night and didn't get to say goodbye.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Sub.
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking to the quirkiness, a lot of us,
at least for me, the last time we talked
[SPEAKER_09]: was on Hash Church when he was on.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was right after the fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember the story he told?
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing he got out with was his
baseball cap, a backpack, and a bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was such an animated storyteller.
[SPEAKER_16]: He was amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: He contributed like Marcus.
[SPEAKER_16]: I noticed his incredible eye and his
selection capability to make offspring
[SPEAKER_16]: that was phenomenal in every respect of
running it.
[SPEAKER_16]: From cultivating it to smoking it to
vaporizing it and washing it.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's very few guys out there that could
really do that with their work.
[SPEAKER_16]: He shared as well, just like Marcus and
Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_16]: He has a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_16]: Say what you will about him, but he
contributed more than most people in the
[SPEAKER_16]: community.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's given us a lot.
[SPEAKER_16]: I still have packs that he gave me 20 some
years ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: I still have like three seeds or four
seeds of.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm waiting to go back through that.
[SPEAKER_16]: When I heard the passing, I immediately
went and got more.
[SPEAKER_16]: It had been on my mind that I wanted to
get some of the stuff that I'd lost like
[SPEAKER_16]: The Void and Third Dimension.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of really great stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: All you young guys out there, get on that
sub cool stuff because it's not going to
[SPEAKER_16]: be around for long.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the whole bubble bags and his
genetics just went so hand in hand that I
[SPEAKER_08]: naturally became a proponent of his
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was constantly turning people on to
bubble bags, making hash and showing
[SPEAKER_08]: people how to make hash and getting the
hash to key people that built their names
[SPEAKER_08]: as hash makers because they had this
incredible material from sub.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you a funny story.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, kind of a funny story, kind of a sad
story.
[SPEAKER_08]: Although one of the years we were in
Amsterdam, we were all staying at Gypsy
[SPEAKER_08]: Nirvana's and it was his friend Danny was
there as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the night that Danny passed away
and that was the cultivar that sub went
[SPEAKER_08]: and created the Danny boy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were staying in this giant house that
Gypsy had and basically that Danny guy had
[SPEAKER_08]: gone out and had the night of his lifetime
in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just had a great night and a great meal
and partied hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Passed away in his sleep as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was probably 15 years ago now,
maybe even more that that happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that he's not in pain anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: That COPD that he had, that lung thing was
pretty serious shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just a bummer for it to go so
sideways right there at the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll definitely never forget sub.
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_16]: I still have the Jack's cleaner cut.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one thing that I really,
really love.
[SPEAKER_16]: I will say I grew the Jack cleaner too and
that stuff is just as phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a little bit more modern,
if you will, as a bit more stacked
[SPEAKER_16]: trichomes than the uniform, but still a
great variety.
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, right on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I did not forget that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was kind of in my ... Here's a rip
for sub.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I just had a really nice one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had a fantastic one.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the weed nerd army out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bong rip to sub cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll do another for that man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a bong rip for sub for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to interrupt all the good
stories about him while you guys were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking and just bark one out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bong rip sub, this is for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just bark one out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guilty.
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to get a guilty shirt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that you have one of Stu's band
shirts on there, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: Iced Earth.
[SPEAKER_18]: I found this shirt in Kelowna.
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's not Kelowna.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was when they opened up that Kamloops.
[SPEAKER_18]: I walked in there and I was like,
I got to get that shirt.
[SPEAKER_18]: Fit me perfect.
[SPEAKER_18]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's always my weekend shirt.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's metal.
[SPEAKER_18]: Stu is just a great making hash out there.
[SPEAKER_18]: He's always preaching the good word of
hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like Stu.
[SPEAKER_18]: All these guys, everybody's out there just
doing what they love to do.
[SPEAKER_18]: At the same time, they're going to work
and producing great hash and working in
[SPEAKER_18]: these farms and having a good time.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just such an excitement of being
able to do it without having your door
[SPEAKER_08]: kicked in, a gun put to your head,
and then put in a cage for a serious
[SPEAKER_08]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you remove all that, all the other
bullshit is like, how much is the tax?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all these bureaucracies and I got
to deal with admins.
[SPEAKER_08]: That shit all piled up on top of itself
does not equal the insanity that we all
[SPEAKER_08]: came through.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the current status of the industry
up there, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_09]: I read something toward the end of this
week.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember where though,
but several facilities that were planned
[SPEAKER_09]: for large-scale production are basically
being mothballed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I saw the same story.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canopy shut down an Alder Grove greenhouse
and a Delta greenhouse, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a little shh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Laid off about 500 people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bummer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, total bummer.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people employed for it,
do you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canopy's been rocking and rolling for a
while.
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw quite a few of them were actually
from out of the country because they're on
[SPEAKER_15]: some sort of work visa to actually work at
the Canopy spot, so even those people have
[SPEAKER_15]: to go back to their perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: They try to find them a place to work.
[SPEAKER_18]: They were here for work visas,
so they were all sent back on planes the
[SPEAKER_18]: day after they shut down.
[SPEAKER_18]: I did a little talk about it.
That's insane.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and it's not just Canopy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Then they opened up collective growth.
[SPEAKER_18]: Bruce Linton opened up the next day,
so you had Canopy Grove falling.
[SPEAKER_18]: In the US, he opened up collective growth,
so that's his new adventure down the US.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is straight across the board with all
the big licensed producers from Aurora.
[SPEAKER_18]: Stocks are crashing from Tilray down to
$9.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's all kinds of things going across
the board about all these LPs.
[SPEAKER_18]: Some are being sued for not producing.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's over one million pounds
[SPEAKER_18]: in storage.
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's all this cannabis going?
[SPEAKER_18]: Why were they hiring out of country?
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have Canadians to do jobs?
[SPEAKER_18]: It's only $13.80 an hour, so come on.
[SPEAKER_18]: We did a little episode on cannabis
culture news live on Friday about it,
[SPEAKER_18]: and I really covered all these topics and
going over what was happening.
[SPEAKER_18]: Me and Anil were talking about it because
right now, you see all these head CEOs.
[SPEAKER_18]: None of them are ahead of their companies
anymore from Terry Boots.
[SPEAKER_18]: All these guys are all gone.
[SPEAKER_18]: All great guys, but at the same time,
the company's completely crashed.
[SPEAKER_18]: The bomb's fallen out.
[SPEAKER_18]: Their stocks are worth nothing.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's dry cannabis straight across the
board.
[SPEAKER_18]: People are getting stuff that was produced
over a year ago now because there's just
[SPEAKER_18]: so much back storage.
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody's grown on their own now,
which is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's one great thing I see is a lot of
people are starting to grow their own four
[SPEAKER_18]: plants.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_18]: The people that really want to can,
and I'm seeing that now.
[SPEAKER_18]: As the year progresses with legalization,
people are starting to get more and more
[SPEAKER_18]: free.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're understanding, yeah, your door
isn't going to get kicked in.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can do this.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can make cash at home, but that fear is
slowly going away, which is great,
[SPEAKER_18]: and that's why I believe a lot of these
places are failing too because,
[SPEAKER_18]: hey, shit, that's a plant.
[SPEAKER_18]: It just grows, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: On the flip side of what Johnny B is
saying, I think there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: companies in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I doing that feedback or is that
someone that's not needed?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of companies that were
inflated and they were smoking mirrors,
[SPEAKER_08]: and they were never maybe really that
real.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that they created this big bubble
that wasn't real, and then that's
[SPEAKER_08]: collapsing and everyone's like,
oh no, oh no.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, well, is it oh no?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's better off with people who are
more focused on doing it right and getting
[SPEAKER_08]: it done the way it should be done from
knowing from the past 10 or 20 or 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_08]: years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming at it from a more realistic
perspective and not trying to just inflate
[SPEAKER_08]: stocks and pump and dumps and grab money
and really create an industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think when the dust settles from the
things that Johnny B's been mentioning,
[SPEAKER_08]: that there'll be some standout companies
and that there'll be some things that
[SPEAKER_08]: it'll be learned from.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm hoping.
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree with Marcus 100%.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a hard thing to do when you haven't
been doing this to Marcus's point for 20,
[SPEAKER_16]: 30 years and you don't know farming and
horticulture and the nuances of all those
[SPEAKER_16]: things.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not an easy task.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that people can come in that aren't
with all the big pump and dumps and they
[SPEAKER_18]: can come in and actually pretty much
hopefully save this industry and get
[SPEAKER_18]: people more focused on getting good
quality canvas, the standards for patients
[SPEAKER_18]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at that whole aspect.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no places to smoke.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no lounges or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: That has to change.
[SPEAKER_18]: They shut down over 400 clubs across
Canada that people used to go and smoke
[SPEAKER_18]: in.
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are all gone.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's really hard for that right now.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think we're going to see a big
change.
[SPEAKER_18]: And once that opens up, I think the
industry will start moving forward.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to start having companies
producing better hash, better edibles,
[SPEAKER_18]: vape pens.
[SPEAKER_18]: They sold like 3.7, 7 million dollars
worth of vape pens in the month of
[SPEAKER_18]: January.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like it just went right through the roof,
right?
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was just Ontario.
[SPEAKER_18]: So people are now getting more in tune
with the system, which is good,
[SPEAKER_18]: right?
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to see some progress.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it affect quality and price at the
dispensary level?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean at the retail level, because
there's overabundance of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: are prices going down or reasonable?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do people find that that's a better
deal than black market cannabis?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think that's the big sort of
switch over in the States that has to
[SPEAKER_09]: still happen because if you have a friend
that can get you weed from some guy around
[SPEAKER_09]: the corner or whatever that's really good
and it's high quality, why would you go
[SPEAKER_09]: pay the taxes and drive to someone's
dispensary and get it?
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you think the dispensaries are
winning that in Canada?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, are people, is that where people
get their weed from?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no more dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: The dispensaries have been like closed,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: One on Vancouver Island that didn't close
and then they basically got a 1.5 million
[SPEAKER_08]: dollar fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like about, and I think recently they may
have cut that in half to 750,000,
[SPEAKER_18]: but that's just like... Yeah, Tree's got
the 1.5 million dollar fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: The fine was double what they sold from
October 17th when it was like
[SPEAKER_08]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: No more selling at a dispensary level
without like permits, licenses,
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And keep in mind, it's not like while
they're doing that, that there's no other
[SPEAKER_08]: options.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, there's an actual system
of an enormous amount of people putting
[SPEAKER_08]: time and energy and money and applications
and like people that aren't just like
[SPEAKER_08]: business people, but like people that came
from the other world, like the dispensary
[SPEAKER_08]: world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dispensaries that are like, okay,
you're going to give me a mechanism to do
[SPEAKER_08]: this legally?
[SPEAKER_08]: Show me what I got to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's all those people doing it as
well, but the limitations are like Alberta
[SPEAKER_08]: has a ton of stores.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what is there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost 500 stores in Alberta, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_18]: 484.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so Alberta has almost 500.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think the rest of Canada has 500
at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are spots where it's not enough
yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it shouldn't be so limited like to
have... There's less than 25 in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, so I mean, Ontario could probably
use like 2000.
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably 4,200.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to happen, don't you
think?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the bet that these companies made,
maybe it's just slower, just a longer
[SPEAKER_09]: timeline and just fraught with regulation,
which means that it needs to be it needs
[SPEAKER_09]: to go through the government.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's the same thing in the States.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, again, just trying to get a report
card of how it's going in Canada,
[SPEAKER_09]: because I can tell you how it's going
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's not going to too differently,
except that it is federal.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a little bit differently in the
sense of anywhere in the country.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's also medical federal,
and there's also adult use federal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're both different things.
[SPEAKER_08]: They kind of have different rules.
[SPEAKER_08]: The adult use rules don't really apply to
the people who have MMPR licenses,
[SPEAKER_08]: like a medical license, whether it's for
growing, possessing.
[SPEAKER_18]: For smoking or being able to, yeah,
possessing.
[SPEAKER_18]: But pretty much if you're medical,
I mean, like certain places, if you're
[SPEAKER_18]: recreational, you can't smoke.
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm medical, I'm pretty much allowed
to at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but a perfect example, Johnny B,
would be a recreational user is going to
[SPEAKER_08]: have to have that wreck jar with the herb
in it, sealed in the trunk of their car.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could have your shit in a bag,
in a bag in the backseat out of breach.
[SPEAKER_18]: Great, great.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, actually, I didn't want to think
about those things.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have to talk more about that,
because if you are not medical,
[SPEAKER_18]: yeah, it has to come to the container that
you purchased it in.
[SPEAKER_18]: It cannot be.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got to be in your trunk.
[SPEAKER_18]: They treat it worse than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_18]: It should be in a safe, probably.
[SPEAKER_18]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trunk safes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Trunk safes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say, OK, you have a little plastic
container or whatever it came in.
[SPEAKER_06]: You break open the tax stamp.
[SPEAKER_06]: You open it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You take all the herb out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put your herb in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: How would they know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam, you know how many people are doing
that?
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody's walking around with a legal
container full of their own.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the standard, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the standard.
[SPEAKER_10]: On that four plant thing, is that a
federal law that people could grow four
[SPEAKER_10]: plants?
[SPEAKER_18]: Certain provinces are unable to manage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Provinces are opting out, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm sure there could be a fight to the
charter, because it is a federal across
[SPEAKER_08]: the board.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not like provinces have thought,
we're not going to allow medical or adult
[SPEAKER_08]: use in our province.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_08]: The charter is really pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_08]: And every time we go to the charter to
say, hey, you can't take away home grows
[SPEAKER_08]: or whatever, we win.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've never lost those.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like these little baby steps
forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not ever really going super far
backwards.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always just little steps forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus, isn't there cities and provinces
in Canada which don't allow alcohol?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly don't think so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should Google that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought up in the far north in some of
the tribal areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's possible they might have their own
internal sort of rules that they... Meth
[SPEAKER_09]: is okay, but no alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say hold back on both of them
personally.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just a joke, folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see someone else is coming into the
room.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our good friend, Jack.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Jack.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all went silent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's Jack?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm sure Jack will figure out his...
Hey, Deb, can you give us a report card on
[SPEAKER_09]: how regulations going in Cali?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, things never go according to plan,
but I'm sure they could go a lot smoother.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I recently became a cannabis
commissioner on our cannabis regulatory
[SPEAKER_10]: commission here in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm an official government person now,
so that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is fun to see how citizens themselves
can help mold the regulations because we
[SPEAKER_10]: are the experts, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: We should be in there getting our opinions
heard.
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So things happening locally.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oakland's one of the cities.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we probably are one of the cities
that have more licenses than anybody else
[SPEAKER_10]: all through the vertical.
[SPEAKER_10]: But unfortunately, we also have the
highest tax rate or one of the highest tax
[SPEAKER_10]: rates in the whole state, although it just
changed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they made this complicated way to
get a rebate so you can get your taxes
[SPEAKER_10]: rebated if you're supporting local
businesses or equity businesses.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, do they know that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they realize that that's driving
producers out to other places or they just
[SPEAKER_09]: don't care?
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, this state is a mess, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: 70% of the sales are still happening on
the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sales at dispensaries, yeah, we have the
reputation of having high-priced cannabis,
[SPEAKER_10]: so that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a bit of a race to the bottom,
which is also a problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the story in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have about 10 dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's probably three.
[SPEAKER_10]: Only three of us can manage to be locally
owned.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody else is a big multi-state or
multinational company.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got Oakland in the portfolio.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can afford to lose money for the
period of time that we're in right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're doing this race to the bottom
on pricing that really affects people like
[SPEAKER_10]: us.
[SPEAKER_10]: We cannot race to the bottom, and in fact,
we won't race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to compete based on delivering
just those old-fashioned values like all
[SPEAKER_10]: of us support, kindness and community,
the healthy side selling weed,
[SPEAKER_10]: and we've got the best cannabis around.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, quality always wins, right,
when it comes to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I know what happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe AT&T felt it, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: For a while, there was all this shock and
dazzle about these Apple Store-style
[SPEAKER_10]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when people went there, they're just
like, I thought this was about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: They're trying to scrub the marijuana out
of the marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the consumers, I think, are starting to
come back to the legacy shops and the
[SPEAKER_10]: legacy products.
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, most of my peers have had to
sell out to multi-state, multi-nationals
[SPEAKER_10]: because they can't afford, they don't have
the runway to survive what's happening
[SPEAKER_10]: right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Canadian market and all those false
valuations and the crash that resulted
[SPEAKER_10]: from it affected people like us because
now the good people can't get funding.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the only people that have funding are
big multi-nationals.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean, we're just basically like,
we just got to walk through fire,
[SPEAKER_10]: stick to the values, and sort of rebuild
the industry again back to its original,
[SPEAKER_10]: what it used to be, more of what it used
to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do see the needle turning in our
favor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like the biggest need in the
industry might actually be teaching the
[SPEAKER_06]: multi-nationals how to grow good wheat
cheaply.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they need that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But as Debbie was saying, the thing that
they're missing is the human element,
[SPEAKER_15]: the one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_15]: The whole reason we got into this was to
help people.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we helped them by talking to them
one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had all these different types of
genetics available to them, but we didn't
[SPEAKER_15]: know how to communicate.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had to learn and teach others how to
communicate effectively.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is still as what Debbie was
speaking toward before, the multinational
[SPEAKER_15]: corporations, they don't necessarily have
the hands-on training or the deep
[SPEAKER_15]: understanding of the training that people
want.
[SPEAKER_15]: When it comes to one-on-one questions,
we've got 20 years of doing this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Debbie even helped teach me how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's one of the many reasons that we
continue to this day to affect changes
[SPEAKER_15]: that's still done one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_15]: People are still curious.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a large influx after the 64 past of
a whole bunch of people who didn't
[SPEAKER_15]: understand what these products are.
[SPEAKER_15]: But now they do, and they also see what
they can do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're trying to make sure that people
understand what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that the new system is
definitely doing much better than the
[SPEAKER_15]: legal market hands down due to the
over-taxation.
[SPEAKER_15]: And no matter what amount of talking that
we do at the state level, it just is all
[SPEAKER_15]: talk.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the more talk still allows the illicit
market to continue to be out there,
[SPEAKER_15]: which can't speak ill of, love it,
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, the legal market
hasn't had its chance or ability to step
[SPEAKER_15]: in.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as Debbie spoke to prior, the reality
is a lot of people decided it was quicker
[SPEAKER_15]: to sell out and get out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the industry has been pit clean of
solid, good people who are in it with a
[SPEAKER_15]: good heart.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a major proliferation of a
whole bunch of people who don't know what
[SPEAKER_15]: they're doing that can fill suits very
effectively, but have no idea how to
[SPEAKER_15]: communicate effectively or the history
that we come from or all the hard work and
[SPEAKER_15]: realities that we've all put in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Through our own blood, sweat, and tears
and many nights waking up in panics.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the realities that, I'm not saying
pity us, poor us.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, this is the reality of where we
are currently.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gonna change because it was
different.
[SPEAKER_15]: As we say currently, it's not 2016
anymore, which is a major reality for a
[SPEAKER_15]: lot of us because back then we could still
deal with, I was dealing with individual
[SPEAKER_15]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I could get and give feedback to the
farmer directly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now in the absence completely of that with
dealing with distributors, the majority of
[SPEAKER_15]: pot that I see is still two to three price
points higher than what we would have put
[SPEAKER_15]: at prior to 2018.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the loss of that availability of unique
genetics is also, it's become a reality of
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone has the same products,
period.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you just have to regionally shop.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no uniqueness that used to draw
people to certain locations because IE
[SPEAKER_15]: they had a specific genetic, they had a
specific type of service.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now everybody offers pretty much the same
services and the same products.
[SPEAKER_15]: The differences of course, now lounges are
the new front, which Debbie has won.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm in the midst of moving into a larger
location.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just got it passed in the city of
Berkeley to allow for lounges here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you, Debbie, for coming out and
speaking for the city council.
[SPEAKER_15]: It still takes 20 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Years later, you still have to be active
in your community and listen and listen to
[SPEAKER_15]: your city council.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when things come up, you have to
activate your base and come out and speak.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the issues that we had a whole bunch
of anti-smoking people show up that
[SPEAKER_15]: sparked all kinds of shenanigans and
scared people with all kinds of hoopla.
[SPEAKER_15]: But fortunately had a well balanced and a
whole bunch of informed people as well as
[SPEAKER_15]: experts who came out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And spoke very eloquently on the issue and
the city understood it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've got it now in Berkeley and
hopefully in the future when we get our
[SPEAKER_15]: new location, that'll be open.
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's other locations all over this
state that do not have that access.
[SPEAKER_15]: And hearing how you lost it in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: They shut down how many lounges,
but they didn't replace them with any
[SPEAKER_15]: other lounges, did they?
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no- None.
[SPEAKER_15]: I will say this- Is the state considering
it in any way, shape or form?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is it just considered a verboten dead
part of reality?
[SPEAKER_18]: Alberta is actually looking at doing this.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's really good to see that.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're actually looking at putting in
lounges and hopefully we'll see that soon.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that will really change it for
the industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: But their type of lounges is actually,
here's what they're proposing.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're gonna get this.
[SPEAKER_18]: So the proposals are that you can consume
cannabis with alcohol in the same venue.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can consume it just in a place where
you can only eat it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Or you can, the third one was to have it
at say a bar type setting and on one side
[SPEAKER_18]: you can consume cannabis by eating it and
then put up like a window and on the other
[SPEAKER_18]: side you could drink.
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is the way they're saying putting
in lounges just for eating, just for
[SPEAKER_18]: animals.
[SPEAKER_10]: People like the beverages.
[SPEAKER_10]: We remodeled the alcohol bar.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you can see it,
into a cannabis bar.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we do the dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: But Oakland doesn't allow on-site smoking.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can only do vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have the vaporizing tool,
a couple of dab breaks and stuff like
[SPEAKER_10]: that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we sell the heck out of the
sodas.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wonder if they'd be able to vaporize.
[SPEAKER_18]: They haven't heard that yet, but let's see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_18]: They've got to do that.
[SPEAKER_18]: They have to open up some type of places
where people can actually enjoy and be
[SPEAKER_18]: able to use cannabis freely and not just
confined in their homes.
[SPEAKER_15]: But not only that, we've also seen
limitations.
[SPEAKER_15]: San Francisco, you're limited to only a
half hour visit to a vape bar.
[SPEAKER_15]: So which is strange in and of itself,
but we know back prior to when BPG got
[SPEAKER_15]: shut down by the feds, we used to have a
two hour limit because you would have
[SPEAKER_15]: people stay there all day.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes people pass out.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's all kinds of realities of why you
arrive to that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So are y'all limited at any particular
time base, Debbie, currently?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we just decided that basic two hour
guideline.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason for that is because people
sometimes need two hours to be able to
[SPEAKER_10]: drive.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to laugh.
[SPEAKER_10]: Vape lounges and smoking lounges are
popping up all over the place right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine if they tried to do that with
alcohol though.
[SPEAKER_13]: They did.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were called speakeasies.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can only stay at an alcohol bar for
two hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_09]: I know people who live there all day.
[SPEAKER_10]: For us, it's just a practical matter.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to turn seats.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you can't stay all day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we found that, of course, at Berkeley
Patients Group, people just had time to
[SPEAKER_10]: kill when we saw you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a bit too comfortable.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'd say it's a new business.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm welcoming Josh and Kelly and Jack to
the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been too long.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to have to interrupt you,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: But welcome, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to see you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so beyond stoked to be on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just so, you know, elated that your
channel is back and that we're all back
[SPEAKER_00]: here together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really excited to be on.
[SPEAKER_12]: And good morning, Jack and Rachel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody out there who's on Hash
Church listening from far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning to everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I slept in because of daylight savings
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first thing I thought is Hash Church
is on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm glad you came, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's what happened to us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just so glad as well to have the
channel back and to have this space for us
[SPEAKER_08]: to just gather.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely a very good thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a blessing.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you been, Josh?
[SPEAKER_12]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's only one dispensary in Nelson,
B.C.
[SPEAKER_12]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, the last really good
medical dispensary got shut down probably
[SPEAKER_12]: four or five months ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was one of the original medical
dispensaries here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that Phil's?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when he opened it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, he was.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he really kept it roots the whole time
and had like an amazing elderly elder
[SPEAKER_12]: group of people here and people that
really relied on him.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it was it's a real, you know,
it's a big problem for the community.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hate to hear that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our compassion club is still going,
I believe, in Vancouver.
Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this it's the one that hasn't been
touched.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the one that's like it's it's kind of
the one that like a bunch of our system
[SPEAKER_08]: was designed, you know, from going and
learn like people from Ottawa would go and
[SPEAKER_08]: Hillary would walk them through the club.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they go back and, you know,
try to come up with these different
[SPEAKER_08]: programs that we've had over the years.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's still going.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the one that hasn't been touched.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of felt like Phil's was one of
those like a true compassion club,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, different from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But a very cool model of just,
you know, having a whole satellite
[SPEAKER_08]: infrastructure set up to support your
patients beyond just selling them herb.
[SPEAKER_08]: But taking some of the profit you're
making and funding like healers and people
[SPEAKER_08]: to be able to sit with the people who are
coming in and the patients who are
[SPEAKER_08]: purchasing cannabis for a variety of
reasons just seemed like a really good
[SPEAKER_08]: system to, you know, to create in Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was that was why it was kind of a
big deal.
[SPEAKER_12]: He felt like he was embodying all that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when that went away, it was it was
a big deal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, yeah, it didn't leave anything else
in the community.
[SPEAKER_12]: And with the work that John Conroy is
doing in the medical programs that really
[SPEAKER_12]: do still exist in Canada, you know,
you would think that there would be some
[SPEAKER_12]: backing backing for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there is local work in the community
being done with community futures.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is some local politicians that
are coming around trying to make something
[SPEAKER_12]: better.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, obviously, the system is broken.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of been set up to fail.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, when you hear the stories of
what's happened in California and all
[SPEAKER_12]: over, I mean, it's when you set up a
system like that, you know, it's it's hard
[SPEAKER_12]: to make it work.
[SPEAKER_12]: So and it's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting, you know,
we've been asked to be in front of a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of different ministers and talk to
different politicians who are putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: laws together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they keep having us at these meetings
and we go and then they just explain the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't really heard that they wanted
to make any changes at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like it's almost like they're
saying, do you understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we say, yes, we understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nothing really changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what we're all talking about
is the homogenization of a culture and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, happening because we're having
to let go of quite a bit of our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture because we can't necessarily make
the funding to continue it going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we see the homogenization of
a lot of different areas, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that become what happened in midwifery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens in all different types of
licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully when they get together with
us next and the ministry meets with us,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be willing to listen to what we
have to say to make some changes so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get some licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going here in B.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a very, very good thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always felt like everything that we
don't like about this system, people
[SPEAKER_08]: continue like civil disobedience is still
occurring in a variety of ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people are doing what they need to do
to sort of push it over the finish line.
[SPEAKER_08]: We always seem to have the charter on our
side.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you really have to like take it
right over the finish line, it's like,
[SPEAKER_08]: man, Conroy's done it before.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like he was bred for this.
[SPEAKER_08]: This work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me all right, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_11]: Since since the last time that that I was
on here, we've been able to do to do a few
[SPEAKER_11]: things in terms of the Tanya space where
we could actually grow the membership's
[SPEAKER_11]: medicine because the CSU approached me
through the chief medical officer here and
[SPEAKER_11]: said that they didn't they didn't like us
being in a gray space.
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't like us buying in a gray
space.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I proposed to them that we use the
ACM PR as of our membership to to start a
[SPEAKER_11]: grow for them so that we didn't have to
buy it in a gray space.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they asked me, they said, how long do
you think that would take you?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said, I don't know, probably six to
nine months to get something going.
[SPEAKER_11]: And because of the climate of affairs,
we've been able to find many turnkey
[SPEAKER_11]: operations that people are are willing to
walk away from.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the CSU said we were at the bottom of
the list that we should expect them to
[SPEAKER_11]: come see us when they've closed every
other dispensary here in Victoria,
[SPEAKER_11]: which there are still a few open.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we know we have this element of time
where we they're letting us proceed
[SPEAKER_11]: without a license.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm applying for a type of design called
health services, including cannabis,
[SPEAKER_11]: that go with my needle exchange and my
safe and safe injection site, safe
[SPEAKER_11]: ventilation site for other types of for
other types of drugs.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is why they let me continue to
move forward is because of the fact
[SPEAKER_11]: there's an opioid crisis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And with the cannabis giveaway that we do
into the street community, we've been able
[SPEAKER_11]: to prove that we can actually lower the
total of overdoses that happen to people
[SPEAKER_11]: who use street drugs.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't think they really want to come
play with our service because we're kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of like Hillary.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we don't try to make money all the
money.
[SPEAKER_11]: The money truly is a cost recovery
service.
[SPEAKER_11]: I sell joints for two dollars and I don't
sell them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I suggest that you donate two dollars to
me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you come in and you have no money
and you say I need a joint, I just give
[SPEAKER_11]: you one.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's more of just trying to not
lose our money while we stand there and
[SPEAKER_11]: voluntarily give things to people.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we may have found a way to not
have to get an LP license to and to
[SPEAKER_11]: operate almost as more.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always speak of it like it's a
community.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a community.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you come into my service, you'll notice
that it's all the same people who use the
[SPEAKER_11]: safe injection site on that on the Pandora
blocks here.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't have like cops.
[SPEAKER_11]: And ambulances and like all the expensive
things they require for the safe injection
[SPEAKER_11]: site, which is only two blocks away from
my cannabis service, even though it's all
[SPEAKER_11]: the same people, because they live in
their own community.
[SPEAKER_11]: I definitely I keep that and that's what I
mean to people.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really not about just the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis just allows the community to
happen that and look at the outcomes for
[SPEAKER_11]: the same people like.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just really thrilled that that
we're starting to get the things for our
[SPEAKER_11]: society that I didn't think that we would
ever be able to have.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like we started out just giving
joints to people, you know, like one day a
[SPEAKER_11]: week, giving animals and joints to people
out of our office because we thought it
[SPEAKER_11]: would be helpful for them.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and I never really thought it
would, you know, turn into this kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Providing a human rights community
service.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really hard to mess with that.
[SPEAKER_12]: When people are just dying around you,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like how much law can you throw at someone
when people are just falling around you?
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's pretty severe down in the in the
east part of Vancouver, like a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: other cities.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I commend you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much, you know, for putting
that that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's anything that's going to
help that area and those people and that
[SPEAKER_00]: community down there, it's definitely
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for continuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To offer cannabis to that group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been really lucky to be able to be
included with all of the kind of heavy
[SPEAKER_11]: weights that are here because,
you know, and I feel really excited,
[SPEAKER_11]: too, to be able to actually to go back and
do something that I know, like that I
[SPEAKER_11]: thought I would never have connection to
again to be able to garden and do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know how nourishing that is for the
soul.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's the next part.
[SPEAKER_11]: That I want to try to sell the government
on is like I want to create a therapeutic
[SPEAKER_11]: area so all those all the people who are
part of the membership can actually come
[SPEAKER_11]: in and water a plant or, you know,
take a leave, you know, do things to be
[SPEAKER_11]: around plants that are healthy,
because honestly, that that's the only
[SPEAKER_11]: reason that that I'm not like one of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I mean, Israel is is I got over
those things using cannabis and and I
[SPEAKER_11]: changed my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to get the more positive.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you create a therapy program for people
to come in off the streets and grow the
[SPEAKER_11]: weed?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so like exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that if you if you come in every day
and you're always like, hey, hey,
[SPEAKER_11]: where's my can I have my daily?
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I have my daily?
[SPEAKER_11]: Rather than just creating a need and
teaching people to need some shit,
[SPEAKER_11]: I would rather actually have them
participate a little bit in it so that
[SPEAKER_11]: when they get and they come get their
donation, they feel like they participated
[SPEAKER_11]: in making that medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, well, that's part of a cycle of
breaking that need, that constant
[SPEAKER_08]: addiction is fucking need.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, bingo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like if you build a community,
then eventually you'll just you'll put
[SPEAKER_11]: down a pipe every five minutes because
you'll be doing every other thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it once becomes every half an hour.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can realize, you know, maybe you can
get away with less of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can kind of, you know,
you'll help people change their own lives
[SPEAKER_11]: instead of telling people that they need
to change their shit or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, would you have thought how many
years ago did I even introduce you to
[SPEAKER_08]: Hillary?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that how you met?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, that's how I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hillary is like 25 years ago or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, man, it was probably like it was I
think it was 1991 or 1992 because I lived
[SPEAKER_11]: on second and commercial and she told me
she was going to start slinging weed in
[SPEAKER_11]: the back of the hippie shop at six dollars
a gram.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a time the prices were thirty two
hundred dollars a pound.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was like, Hillary, man, you're
insane.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you're never going to get you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and I remember having these
funny arguments with her.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because she would have to pay more than
the guy who came in and was buying like a
[SPEAKER_11]: hundred or whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: So she was like she was like hilarious to
me.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then she became the most successful
person ever.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of use her to model that you helped
her build to do what we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you're definitely doing the good
work, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I just love to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm stoked that you came on to share more
about it and definitely stoked Hash Church
[SPEAKER_08]: is back as a venue for you to even be able
to be here at.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks so much for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to change positions in my house
because my kids are about to go out to the
[SPEAKER_11]: pool and I'm standing in their way.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you know, one thing one thing I
wanted to mention was when we met with
[SPEAKER_00]: John Conroy sometime this winter,
we were talking about ACM PR coops and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical coops and the legality of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like recreational and you
know, the federal legalization up here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada is still, you know, was taking over
a lot of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about the medical that's
continued?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really am encouraging people in
Canada to start looking at, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical coops because they're not really
illegal yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a gray space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I said to John Conroy,
what happens if we just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: collect medical licenses and we put it up
on our website?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, it's not illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that's a really interesting
conversation in Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it keeps coming up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for sharing that, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to for all of us, actually,
to support one of our community members,
[SPEAKER_08]: Slothy Heads, who's in the hospital right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's in chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's told us the church is making this way
better, but he's got mad anxiety right
[SPEAKER_08]: now, some shit that he's about to go
through.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not going into detail, but it's some
hospital hospital shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anyone wants to send Slothy Heads a
positive message, I'll start with Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, keep keep your head up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be positive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't don't fall into the nervousness.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got a whole community of people
thinking about you and we're here for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: We love you, Slothy Heads.
[SPEAKER_12]: Give us a shout if we can support you in
any way your family can hit us up.
[SPEAKER_12]: How can we help you?
[SPEAKER_12]: We're thinking about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prayers to you right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: As part of that crazy group of people that
meet every time there's a hash church and
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark sets up an episode there's kind of
like this convergent of these stray dogs
[SPEAKER_09]: that come together and he's one of them.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've definitely been there and I've beaten
those fears and believe me, everybody's
[SPEAKER_18]: got your back and you're going to be
great.
[SPEAKER_18]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_18]: Stay strong.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Slothy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone's pulling from you, Slothy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Slothy, you got you got professionals
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, don't be too nervous.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, they know what they're doing,
but at the same time, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: educate yourself and do the best you can.
[SPEAKER_15]: And here I'll burn one for you if nobody
else will.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, bong rip, said somebody who would be
there usually.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll join in on that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had this pipe waiting for a reason.
[SPEAKER_18]: So this one's for you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ripper for Slothy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my hash wants me to take a really
big rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: By all means.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're sharing good news,
I wanted to give an update on a little
[SPEAKER_01]: corner of the California market and the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: market, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Nevada County, our county has a
cultivation ordinance and Nevada City,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little town in the county, has allowed
all of the various license types.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just this month, the Caladrius Network
is going to be up and running again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be happening in the
context of our farmers, our manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_01]: our processors, our distributors,
and our retailers are all licensed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: California space here in Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the Caladrius Network is going
to be working again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish the news was better about forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silas has been having a really hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen forest twice this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silas has been on a helicopter down to
either UCSF Children's Hospital or Davis
[SPEAKER_01]: three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's lovely about what's happening
here in the county is all of the folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: know forest and know the situation there
have stepped up to make it happen without
[SPEAKER_01]: him needing to be involved as much as he
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the families were starting to
be able to provide them the products they
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really a blessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is some good news in the
California space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, our model was always that
those families would be able to get their
[SPEAKER_01]: products at no cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, all of the licensees with
all of the craziness that's happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulated market and trying to survive
all the multinational and multi-state
[SPEAKER_01]: operators that are in the California space
here in our county, we have people who
[SPEAKER_01]: have stood up and are making that happen
at no cost to those families.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still only at 38%.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've only permitted farms in the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2015, we had 3,500.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cultural extinction event is still
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the CDFA has dropped regulations,
proposed regulations on Appalachians of
[SPEAKER_01]: origin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a potential
opportunity there for small farmers maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about all I have on the
California space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on another topic, I wanted to let you
know that I've gotten busy in Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state of Utah has created a medical
cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And long story short, I'm spending a lot
of time at a vertically integrated entity
[SPEAKER_01]: in Salt Lake City.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the first legal pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sold legal product on Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the program, there's good things about
it and bad things about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A real issue lately has been that in order
to get into the pharmacy, you have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a physician's recommendation is the first
step.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's eight steps involved in
working with the state bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started doing it on March 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on March 2nd, legal sale started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, there was, I think there
were 10 cards in the whole state on March
[SPEAKER_01]: 2nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're up to a couple of
hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good news is it's really focused
around medical need.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no recreational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, what does that really mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means you need a doctor's
recommendation for some condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the folks that I spoke to in the
pharmacy, most of them were experienced
[SPEAKER_01]: users and were real excited at the
opportunity to actually buy legal product
[SPEAKER_01]: in Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I think, a big step in the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utah is one of the most conservative
states in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like all of the, well, I won't get
into politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm real excited, actually,
at the opportunity to do education.
[SPEAKER_01]: My focus mostly at the pharmacy is
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help people understand the
endocannabinoid system and what it can do
[SPEAKER_01]: for people and the fact that as much as I
personally love the feeling of being
[SPEAKER_01]: stoned, that's not the whole story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a really unique opportunity to
help people understand that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely not the whole story,
but it is the cracking of the book.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the state of California now,
medical users can get it for free.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's tax free for the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's giving it to them.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: That law just changed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think maybe March 1st was the first day
because before that they taxed,
[SPEAKER_10]: like you still had to pay, there was no
free cannabis at all because you still had
[SPEAKER_10]: to pay taxes, cultivation tax first,
and then excise tax.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I guess potentially sales tax on
top of that to give anyone free cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, that finally changed.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty significant, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I still donate.
[SPEAKER_15]: I donated and didn't stop.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I paid the, we found good providers who
gave us the cannabis for a deep discount.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were able to still, we had to still
make it as a transaction, but we still
[SPEAKER_15]: gave away cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: But this law, which we worked with many
other organizations throughout the state
[SPEAKER_15]: of California, again, to stay diligent out
there people.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we changed the law up there in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we failed prior.
[SPEAKER_15]: The previous governor gave us kind of all
the big fingers.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had to go back and do it again.
[SPEAKER_15]: After failing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so finally we got it passed.
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, it is going to be much easier to
give away cannabis again to those that are
[SPEAKER_15]: in need, which is the whole reason we got,
many of us got into this in the first
[SPEAKER_15]: place.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty ridiculous that a dispensary
who wanted to give cannabis free to a
[SPEAKER_06]: patient had to pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you have to buy it, then pay taxes
and then give, then you can give it away.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a TN.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to reach out to you too,
just to make sure to reach out on this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular note with us, with Dempere and
all of the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's a lot of us that would like
to support you as well as you,
[SPEAKER_00]: Debbie, and what you all are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we can go with tax free and
there can be some donations with minimal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, funding back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to hear more about it and how we
can be helpful and wait absolutely to you
[SPEAKER_00]: and Caladrius network.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to continue to support that
effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Dempere is the largest growing
regenerative producing flower in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all about supporting these kinds
of foundations and these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: movements.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the number one core value of our
mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's brand new.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to figure out ways to how to get
this whole thing started again.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, except in places like Berkeley,
which the city of Berkeley actually put in
[SPEAKER_10]: a city law when the ordinance was written
saying that dispensaries had to pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_10]: They had to give away the equivalent of 2%
of the medical marijuana flowers that they
[SPEAKER_10]: sell.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, all the dispensaries have,
have through this time, all of them have
[SPEAKER_10]: the giveaway programs.
[SPEAKER_12]: The laws are changing so fast everywhere
that part of our mission, Kelly and I is
[SPEAKER_12]: just going to all these different bio
regions in the world and learning the laws
[SPEAKER_12]: and trying to bring people together and
learn how to navigate them.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's like, we all live in an area that
has a certain amount of restrictions and
[SPEAKER_12]: regulations on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're different in every area,
but there's also congruency within every
[SPEAKER_12]: area.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're working on creating this network,
you know, of lawyers and scientists and
[SPEAKER_12]: farmers and all these different things
that we can all support each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the purpose of the conferences
that we have coming up to provide that
[SPEAKER_12]: education to the community and to the
masses, which we're doing another
[SPEAKER_12]: conference at the Heartwood Sanctuary in
Humboldt in May.
[SPEAKER_12]: And people can look out for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't come out with the exact details
for the public on that yet, but we're
[SPEAKER_12]: really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just really quick, what that's going to
be is that Heartwood from April 30th until
[SPEAKER_00]: May 3rd, it's going to be an unbelievable
gathering retreat over Beltane weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be almost all of the Dem
Peer Farmers and Dem Peer Collective
[SPEAKER_00]: members that are going to be teaching and
we're going to be gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know, one thing I'd like to
say is that the Dalai Lama always told us
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need to really learn the rules so
we know how to break them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that that's like one of the
most guiding quotes in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're all talking about
here is how can we learn the rules so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get around them and still be able to
provide medicine and education to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what we're doing within
our collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our collective is not just like a few
people can join.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're out there and you're doing
amazing work and you're growing beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and you're out there trying to
change the laws throughout the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: get ahold of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a group that, you know,
we're international and we're becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: very large and we're becoming a really
loud voice in this cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's really an exciting time because
we're working on creating commerce on an
[SPEAKER_12]: international, on a website for us all.
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically what we're, we're getting
people together and saying, let's create
[SPEAKER_12]: commerce on everything outside of
regulations, everything outside of the THC
[SPEAKER_12]: market.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get a regenerative market.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get a place going for all of the
products that we have.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then slowly we can change the,
as the laws change, we can make other
[SPEAKER_12]: products available.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what's really exciting about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we did, we got back from Hawaii
and I would like to put a, a shout out to
[SPEAKER_12]: the, the Maui Cannabis Guild for one.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's, there's insane things are
happening on the Hawaiian islands when it
[SPEAKER_12]: comes to genetically modified crops,
not having to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, Monsanto and Syngenta,
and Matson and horrible genetically
[SPEAKER_12]: modified seed companies are creating
chemical seed on the islands in mass.
[SPEAKER_12]: And even one month ago on Maui,
they sprayed potatoes with Paraquat.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's an article, you can look up
Paraquat, potatoes, Maui, and you can find
[SPEAKER_12]: an article on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're trying to test their crops
with these chemicals to see if they grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a research and development plot.
[SPEAKER_12]: And these are banned US chemicals that
they're openly using on fields right now
[SPEAKER_12]: on a tropical island in the middle of the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually more important than ever
because we all know that cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: become a catalyst to unveiling what's
going on in big ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become a catalyst for unveiling
what's going on in big pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more important than ever that
Hawaii continues moving forward with their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these horrible, bad,
illegal practices that are going on on the
[SPEAKER_00]: islands can be unveiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can really see what's going on
because it will be the first time that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is being tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be the first time that,
you know, crops are being tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so imperative for all of us to be
supporting Hawaii legislation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And regenerative agriculture is on the
move.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are people realizing that
sustainable agriculture or organics is not
[SPEAKER_12]: enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't sustain land that's ill.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to regenerate the land that's ill.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're working with edible food,
forest people, amazing food security
[SPEAKER_12]: people.
[SPEAKER_12]: What we're saying is if everyone can grow,
let's use cannabis as a point of
[SPEAKER_12]: consciousness to catalyze ourselves,
to move forward.
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're going to grow four cannabis
plants, let's grow at least four food
[SPEAKER_12]: plants too.
[SPEAKER_12]: If all of us grow some food in our
backyard, it takes away the need to buy it
[SPEAKER_12]: from the store.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if you go to Hawaii, 98% of the
food in the store is exactly from the
[SPEAKER_12]: mainland.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's from Mexico or California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're saying- And that makes zero
sense because it's the most lush,
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing area that can, you know,
all different kinds of fruits and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables can be grown there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a beautiful- Well,
wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a reason why this is hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of it is it's cheaper to produce it
out of the places.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second thing is that why it's got a
serious problem with fruit flies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can't grow papayas there as a
commercial crop unless they're- Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually that's untrue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molokai is growing a massive amount of
papayas and also the farmers market are
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying a lot of the percentage of the
vegetables that actually aren't being
[SPEAKER_00]: registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to a lot of farms and we do see
that there is viability for small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why they've been- How
can you grow papayas on Hawaii without
[SPEAKER_06]: fruit flies getting in unless it's inside
of a screened greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, then you're saying that
you're running that risk all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics when that's just not totally true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not every place has fruit fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hawaii does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I saw a lot of commercial papaya
that was grown on Molokai.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see a lot of beautiful organic
fruit that was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to a lot of farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we weren't running into that issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: 90% of more of the papayas commercially
grown in Hawaii are GMO.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly, and that's the whole entire point
of what we're making.
[SPEAKER_12]: 90% of all food that we're eating,
not just papayas, are coming from one or
[SPEAKER_12]: two hybridizations or feminizations of a
food plant that comes from the wild.
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole entire purpose really of what
we're saying is go beyond the normal
[SPEAKER_12]: papaya that everyone's growing.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's lots of different papayas in the
world.
[SPEAKER_12]: So grow a different kind of papaya from
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's plenty of natural farmers on
Hawaii successfully creating their own
[SPEAKER_12]: nutrients, successfully creating their own
pest sprays that are growing amazing,
[SPEAKER_12]: very nutritious food.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the point of saying that you can't
grow papayas in an integrated food forest,
[SPEAKER_12]: absolutely you can grow papayas.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason- If you try and grow
papayas on a 20 acre plot and it's fruit
[SPEAKER_12]: flies not to show up, you probably missed
the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the idea is that the fruit fly
problem is happening because of big ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big ag has gone there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've killed all of the predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've killed all of the other things
that are in the soil that are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: actually eat any type of fruit fly that's
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's creating an out of balance
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that big ag has created a
horrible out of balance system on the
[SPEAKER_00]: island.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fruit flies were not in Hawaii until they
were introduced on some sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: agricultural crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were able to grow them until,
I forget what it was, 25, 30 years ago
[SPEAKER_06]: when the fruit fly problem was introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, and now they're dealing with the
rat lungworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rat lungworm is also something
that is a hundred percent brought about by
[SPEAKER_00]: big ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just naming problems that are
problems on top of problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want you to think I've supported
big ag because I'm not.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Hawaiian commercial papaya farmers,
there's a reason why they're growing GMO
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's easy to grow, whereas the
other crops are very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's happening on that level is a
brainwashing happening by the government
[SPEAKER_12]: that says, you can't do this.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to buy it from the store.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's nothing cheaper than
someone growing something for free in
[SPEAKER_12]: their backyard.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to also look at why it is
happening on Maui.
[SPEAKER_15]: You've lost the pineapple, right,
that used to be a major part of the
[SPEAKER_15]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you've lost sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what's happening, people, and why are
you seeing a large swath of GMO start to
[SPEAKER_15]: come?
[SPEAKER_15]: And why there's a lot of experiments
currently going on is because they have
[SPEAKER_15]: now sold or leasing all that land that was
for sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now they're basically, I was there
over the holidays and saw all kinds of
[SPEAKER_15]: experimental fields of all kinds of
experimental crops from sunflowers to all
[SPEAKER_15]: kinds of other things I couldn't
necessarily name.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's large swaths of all the center
of Maui that they're just trying to figure
[SPEAKER_15]: out what they're doing agriculturally.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm sorry to hear all this is happening
and that that's all trading place because
[SPEAKER_15]: it's such a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_15]: And to know that I've even seen that going
down is rather disheartening.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they've gone from mass producing
pineapple and sugar cane to mass producing
[SPEAKER_12]: genetically modified seed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not just Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason why they're doing that
is because the plots of land that were
[SPEAKER_00]: left that you're talking about,
like the sugar cane and the pineapple is
[SPEAKER_00]: not much else can grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally dead dirt land that isn't
only dead, but like is totally toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're really encouraging the
cannabis industry to start unveiling these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues and problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually has taken the Maui
Cannabis Guild that those are the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes the cannabis folks to have these
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting together and they're
starting to really challenge the problems
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going on in Maui and throughout
the islands.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's a wake up just for
humans.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just go to the store and get what
you need.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's things we can do.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not saying that one person can grow
everything they need in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_12]: What we're saying is let's do some things
that we can do and make a difference.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are beautiful people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in full agreement with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I lived in Santa Cruz County,
I grew 45 kinds of fruits and vegetables
[SPEAKER_06]: every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, that's where my heart comes
from.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a French organic, biodynamic grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always have been.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are the things that we need to
continue bringing to light in this new
[SPEAKER_12]: time coming.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, we're very hopeful and there
really are a lot of people doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: amazing things.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we traveled to incredible farms that
are making a big difference and,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, things to hip agriculture and
the Blue Dragon Farm and conscious rhythms
[SPEAKER_12]: and all the people that we've visited on
the islands.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's beautiful things happening and we
can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I mean, the bottom line is there's a
lot of hope out there and we really just
[SPEAKER_12]: need to continue to be very, very smart
and have a lot of energy and really
[SPEAKER_12]: inspire each other to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's really what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would like to say on a hash note
that there was a lot of really beautiful
[SPEAKER_12]: hash on the islands and we really enjoyed
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what kind of hash was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, water hash?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dry sift?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't see any dry sift.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was mostly water hash and, you know,
and freeze dried and, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: good strains like sour tangy, hitman
mostly.
[SPEAKER_12]: We also brought some some hash over from
California to big up Icewook and Cushkirk.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know, a lot of nice bubble
floating around these days.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got some some really nice bubble from
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: That Mendo breath was really just when you
blew it out, people were like,
[SPEAKER_08]: what the hell?
[SPEAKER_08]: That tastes like that smells like some
crazy perfume or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just had the most incredible smell in
the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: My uncle quite enjoyed it, actually,
back in Manitoba, which I got to give my
[SPEAKER_08]: uncle a shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure if you guys have ever watched the
channel, people who are watching right now
[SPEAKER_08]: have maybe no one on the panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did a show with my uncle.
[SPEAKER_08]: The last time I was in Winnipeg in
January, just a live show on my phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't have a recording of it,
unfortunately, but he's an awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he like barrel rolled his truck like
three times yesterday on the highway after
[SPEAKER_08]: getting cut off.
[SPEAKER_08]: He lives in a cabin in the woods,
like an hour and a half away from from the
[SPEAKER_08]: city of Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he rolled.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like 65 years old, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he rolled his truck multiple times,
but got a little got a little bruised,
[SPEAKER_08]: but said he was OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: But still want to give a shout out to him
and hope that, yeah, Uncle Gio,
[SPEAKER_08]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uncle Gio, I hope you're doing OK,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you're OK, in fact.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy how fast things can happen.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was the puff ones that you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need us to send him some more Mendo
breath, let us know.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're getting prepared this year with some
really beautiful hash strains,
[SPEAKER_12]: too.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we brought up we have a couple plants
of the strawberry guava and the punch
[SPEAKER_12]: breath going.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have amazing crosses from Gage Green
and the high school sweethearts and the
[SPEAKER_12]: motor breasts and the dizzy breast.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: The massive seeds and the Hella Seed
Company, lots of citrus smoothies and the
[SPEAKER_12]: lapues and the gac strains.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, really, it's kind of on and on
like there's the the Emerald Mountain
[SPEAKER_12]: Legacy Seed family and all of the the
Royal Kush lines.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, just we're really excited about
all the seeds that have been gifted to us.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we didn't name all of the seeds that we
got, but we want to give a lot of love to
[SPEAKER_12]: everyone that we've been trading and
getting seeds from.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're really excited about this year.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're going to make an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been traveling around and
getting all the hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really upping our hemp game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be the majority of
what we're what we're doing this year and
[SPEAKER_00]: continuing on with the real medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mix it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm definitely going to put the family in
the vehicle and come down and see you
[SPEAKER_08]: guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is, Sam, ask your hand question that
you were talking to me about that Marcus
[SPEAKER_09]: said.
[SPEAKER_09]: Save it for church.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which question was that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, we were talking.
[SPEAKER_08]: No THC in a dry sift CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never seen analysis of a CBD dry sift
that was over 50 percent that had below
[SPEAKER_06]: point three percent THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've done thousands and thousands and
thousands of analysis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe just ask in general, has anyone
ever seen that before?
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I haven't.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never seen dry sift from from hemp
before.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, let me back up and say I've seen
trichomes that have fallen off of hemp
[SPEAKER_09]: during the processing of hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's kind of like a, you know,
a brown dust.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's not intentionally made like
dry sift, but for all intents and
[SPEAKER_09]: purposes, it is, you know, knocked off
plant matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is this is dry sift from a high
CBD variety called I think it was
[SPEAKER_06]: champagne or I don't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a couple of them that they had
and it was 50 to 60 percent CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they claimed it was all below point
three percent THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their analysis showed it at one point.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them was one point eight and one of
them was two point something.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were really, really low.
[SPEAKER_06]: And see, the problem with that is that if
you start with a variety of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll say it's 15 percent CBD and you want
to get 60 percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's point three percent or point two
percent THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, your dry sift is going to be four
times that.
[SPEAKER_09]: At least.
[SPEAKER_06]: You understand it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the real core problem is that they
recently discovered that the CBD synthase
[SPEAKER_06]: genes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Produce THC also in about a 20 to one
ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's 20 percent CBD, there'll be
one percent THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so it leaks a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some leakage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you, skunk man, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're seeing is is like a ratio
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard of the wolf strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one that was down in Louisiana
and down in the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually getting like and it's
a North Carolina THC with like an upwards
[SPEAKER_00]: of a 10 percent, nine percent CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a nondetectable THC,
which sort of blows out that whole sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio ideology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that strain?
[SPEAKER_06]: But I I'd like to see the analysis because
I don't trust most analysis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen lab just fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that, you know,
I would like to see forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some analysis, but only from two
different labs that were down from North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the seeds, so we're going to be
working with it and seeing what we can
[SPEAKER_00]: find.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it hard to talk intelligently about
something when the basis of what we're
[SPEAKER_12]: talking about is not stable like testing?
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we're talking about cannabinoids
and ratios, but then at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_12]: we're saying, but the testing isn't good.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I mean, I'm all about it, but it's it
is frustrating.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had my own lab for 25 years and I did
testing where I sent exact same copies to
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Bernheiser in Switzerland,
Dr. O'Sullivan in the United States,
[SPEAKER_06]: Mississippi, and my own lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were always in agreement.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's getting better.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the methods or the instruments.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really, you know, it's everything
coupled together when you're doing a
[SPEAKER_09]: quantitative determination of measuring of
anything, especially at low levels.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your method and your sampling has to be
very, very accurate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it is accurate and it is
reproducible, I mean, the results that you
[SPEAKER_09]: get are actually good, like Sam said.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first thing you have to do,
Mark, is make sure that you take three
[SPEAKER_06]: samples of the same stuff and get three
reproducible results in your own lab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the first thing you have to do,
I mean, if you're doing the measurements
[SPEAKER_09]: yourself, is you have to have an
instrument that's properly calibrated and
[SPEAKER_09]: your analytical method where you're
actually taking a small sample of plant
[SPEAKER_09]: material and, you know, weighing it out
and determining how much CBD or how much
[SPEAKER_09]: THC or how much, you know, doing a
cannabinoid profile measurement by HPLC,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, it requires an analytical
balance that could read up to four decimal
[SPEAKER_09]: points and, you know, you're weighing
stuff out and you're dissolving it and
[SPEAKER_09]: you're basically using a good analytical
method.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be able to get reproducible
results.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think what you're saying,
Sam, is that you should do three
[SPEAKER_09]: individual samples from the same plant
material.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's typically like when you ask a lab to
repeat the result, they're repeating it on
[SPEAKER_09]: the same sample, but it's good to know
that, you know, again, the sample that you
[SPEAKER_09]: have is a good representative sample for
what you're trying to, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: analyze.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in a lot of these labs, what you'll see
is, you know, things like bullet grinders
[SPEAKER_09]: that basically take the plant material and
completely homogenize it into like a green
[SPEAKER_09]: powder.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's completely homogeneous and,
you know, the level of sophistication in
[SPEAKER_09]: some of these labs aren't such that you
can get really good reproducible results
[SPEAKER_09]: because more of the analytical method and
exactly what they're using, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: in terms of sample.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we started our lab, we had serious
problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one was we ordered our standards
from the NIDA and from the United Nations
[SPEAKER_06]: Drug Group in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we sent them to us and they said that
they were 99.8% TDC or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, when we finally tested it and we had
a solely recognized in our own results,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was less than 86.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's not good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's one thing that has
improved.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, several things actually have
improved when I think about it,
[SPEAKER_09]: is that there are now equipment
manufacturers, who are making analytical
[SPEAKER_09]: equipment that is very sophisticated
analytical equipment, but easy enough for
[SPEAKER_09]: someone who can use a web browser to
basically operate.
[SPEAKER_09]: The good thing is that, again,
making it easier to operate hopefully
[SPEAKER_09]: takes out a lot of the user error that's
associated with making these measurements.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the analytical standards are now
available from companies and you can get
[SPEAKER_09]: these.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, at the exceedingly low
concentration that makes it not something
[SPEAKER_09]: that they have to report to the DEA.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the company that actually makes the
standards has to have a Schedule I license
[SPEAKER_09]: because obviously they're making these
solutions of THC and CBD and all the
[SPEAKER_09]: analytical standards.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in which you have to run, as you
remember, Sam, is a calibration curve
[SPEAKER_09]: where you take those analytical standards
and you do serial dilutions and you look
[SPEAKER_09]: to see how the peak in the chromatogram
decreases as a function of concentration.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that gives you what's called a
calibration curve, which, again,
[SPEAKER_09]: gives you a good indication that you could
measure that cannabinoid to those levels
[SPEAKER_09]: of sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if that is all square and you use
the same method to analyze your
[SPEAKER_09]: experimental samples, cannabis sample XYZ,
then you should be able to get a
[SPEAKER_09]: reproducible test result.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in that way, I think testing has
improved in that there are good methods
[SPEAKER_09]: and good analytical standards for it to be
employed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Sam, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys, all those different labs
that you were sending to, did you all do
[SPEAKER_08]: the exact same testing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we use the same protocol,
correct?
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: When we calibrated our laboratories,
when we were originally doing testing,
[SPEAKER_15]: we brought the person over from Europe
who'd made the testing solution for
[SPEAKER_15]: government.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was very helpful for us because
then they were able to then do ring
[SPEAKER_15]: testing immediately with other
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we were able to at least nail down THC
until then that secondary spike CBD came
[SPEAKER_15]: around.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is, what, 08, 09.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hasn't it ATN?
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you think it's gotten better?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, significantly better.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's also, it's not consistently
standard across the board.
[SPEAKER_15]: So even though there are standards now put
out and now everybody knows how to arrive
[SPEAKER_15]: at a certain result, we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're still trying to add and find out
what we can't see, what are the
[SPEAKER_15]: pesticides, what are the herbicides,
what are the other things that people have
[SPEAKER_15]: been adding.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's now again shifted away from us,
the dispensaries, to now the distributors
[SPEAKER_15]: and the growers, because they have to
actually have it tested before it even
[SPEAKER_15]: gets to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: What lab do you use?
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't use a lab anymore, oddly enough.
[SPEAKER_15]: I used a laboratory and we calibrated a
laboratory right around the corner from us
[SPEAKER_15]: that actually did over testing for
Novartis and Bayer.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they were basically dealing with liver
and living cell tissues.
[SPEAKER_15]: And a couple of the guys who ran the
machines were also growers.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they started testing their own and we
were engaged together.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we started that discussion and
then we started, we spent literally
[SPEAKER_15]: millions of dollars on testing just to get
everything up to calibrated and
[SPEAKER_15]: understanding just how to come up with a
methodology that we could get into the
[SPEAKER_15]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_15]: You couldn't get cannabis into the
laboratories because then it's a $10,000
[SPEAKER_15]: fine per test.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that same gentleman helped us come up
with the methodology where we took a
[SPEAKER_15]: certain amount.
[SPEAKER_15]: He told us how to do a representative
sample from a pound to a kilo.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we would take that, put it in,
we would grind it for a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_15]: times, put it in at 100% alcohol,
shake it for a certain amount of times.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we would take the pipette and extract
that solution.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we would take that solution and
that could then go to the laboratory and
[SPEAKER_15]: then be tested.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that way we weren't actually putting,
we were getting as much of the
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabinoids dissolved and we tried many
different solutions, but 100% alcohol
[SPEAKER_15]: turned out to be the best methodology for
both the gas chromatograph and the UVH
[SPEAKER_15]: PLCs.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this laboratory around the corner had
both machines, but as we started to get
[SPEAKER_15]: expansive, those people who actually own
those UVH PLC machines with which they had
[SPEAKER_15]: six to eight of them, and that's hundreds
of thousands, if not millions of dollars,
[SPEAKER_15]: basically weren't too happy with what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the end they went their way and I
had to find other laboratories to work
[SPEAKER_15]: with.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was the frustration of pioneering
back then, but without a doubt,
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Sheldon, it's gotten a lot better
across the board, even when after that and
[SPEAKER_15]: the other laboratories that we were
dealing with, CW here, was doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: our testing, but that still took,
it takes 72 hours for the culture test for
[SPEAKER_15]: microbes or microbiology.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you have to then do the actual
screening for the THC, CBD, and then the
[SPEAKER_15]: other pesticides.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that took another considerable amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it just takes a lot of time,
unfortunately, to hold in cannabis to get
[SPEAKER_15]: it tested.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now it falls completely on the grower and
the distributor now, but we as the stores
[SPEAKER_15]: pay for it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the challenges in the
testing realm is that it's kind of known
[SPEAKER_01]: in the community of growers that there's
some labs that the test results are a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The numbers are a little better at some
labs than they are at others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when your product gets to the
dispensary or distributor, those higher
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers help sell the product.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Wade, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_16]: I see that often in multiple states.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've seen scandals exposed, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: They have been exposed in the media and
some labs have been shut down,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I can't say that I don't know that
it's not happening anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you guys know it,
but we have this weird system in
[SPEAKER_10]: California, the three tier distribution
system, where all of our testing happens
[SPEAKER_10]: at the distribution level.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a law that allows research R&D
testing to happen at the cultivation and
[SPEAKER_10]: hatchery level.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, retail doesn't test at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know if you guys know this
history, but the alcohol industry lobbied
[SPEAKER_10]: our legislature and managed to pass this
law saying all California cannabis had to
[SPEAKER_10]: go through six distribution companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was state law for a very short period
of time, a law called MACRSA, of all
[SPEAKER_10]: things.
[SPEAKER_10]: It started out called MIMRSA, like the
skin disease, total poison.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that thing passed through the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was only going to be six companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was big alcohol that got this
legislation passed, imagining that they'd
[SPEAKER_10]: be the experts, the big alcohol
distribution companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought the unions were involved in it
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big alcohol, crazy talks.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Prop 64, that's the biggest benefit
that Prop 64 did for us because Prop 64
[SPEAKER_10]: knocked that part of the regulation right
out of law and said, okay, if we have to
[SPEAKER_10]: have three tier distribution, then anybody
can get the license.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now really anybody can get a
distribution license.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a micro business, two micro
business licenses.
[SPEAKER_10]: One in Oakland and one in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_10]: So manufacturing, distribution and retail.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have done distribution and testing is
a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to be a distributor because
the testing is like a, I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: if it doesn't pass, you're just stuck with
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The regulations for what you have to do
for cannabis that doesn't pass through the
[SPEAKER_10]: testing is so complicated.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, distribution is complicated.
[SPEAKER_12]: And have you had issues with testing all
your weed and then maybe it going into an
[SPEAKER_12]: edible product and then it failing?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the food products that you
combined it with were not up to the same
[SPEAKER_12]: standards as the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well imagine when you get your product
from cultivators and manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_10]: not everyone does one of those R&D tests.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's kind of, you're kind of flying
blind, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know if the product you're
getting from manufacturing or cultivation
[SPEAKER_10]: passes testing yet because the distributor
has to test it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So at distribution, you might be the one
that's surprised you failed the test.
[SPEAKER_10]: And believe me, they notified the state
immediately.
[SPEAKER_10]: So suddenly you get a note from the BCC
also saying, we see that the flower you
[SPEAKER_10]: got from that cultivator didn't pass
distribution and you got 30 days to
[SPEAKER_10]: destroy it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't return it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The solution for that would be to make the
product without any cannabinoids first,
[SPEAKER_06]: have it tested and then make it with the
tested cannabinoid product together with
[SPEAKER_06]: the final product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way you're not just spinning your
wheels.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't work that way, unfortunately,
currently.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, and then changing that, it takes
near a Herculean lift of changes at the
[SPEAKER_15]: state level.
[SPEAKER_15]: The state now has just amended some of the
realities that we're dealing with in the
[SPEAKER_15]: sense as opposed to going through three
regulatory bodies, they're consolidating
[SPEAKER_15]: it down to one to make it easy for some of
the dealing with regulations.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the realities that Debbie's talking
about where it comes to testing and
[SPEAKER_15]: testing product, that's just the reality
of every day dealing in cannabis business,
[SPEAKER_15]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_15]: And one that used to fall onto us,
the retailers.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not surprised that it's falling
heavily on the distributor.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it would be falling more toward
the farmer or the farmer would have having
[SPEAKER_15]: it tested and taking it to the
distributor, but that doesn't seem to be
[SPEAKER_15]: the case here.
[SPEAKER_16]: In Massachusetts, I have to, before
anything goes out as a cultivator and a
[SPEAKER_16]: processor, it has to be tested.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I test everything before I make it
into WaterHash.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to spend all of my time on
such a focused process.
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the end, I have a microid problem.
[SPEAKER_16]: Or a heavy metal problem or whatever it
might be.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, we have CAT 3 screening.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's really, really, really detailed.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I welcome it personally because I like
to know what I'm starting with before I go
[SPEAKER_16]: into the lab and spend my time there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then everything there for after that
particular manifest, if it changes a form,
[SPEAKER_16]: if I take that WaterHash and make it into
something, that has to be tested again
[SPEAKER_16]: before that even goes out.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a very detailed process that I
actually welcome.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I actually think more people should
have access to so they can better
[SPEAKER_16]: understand the material they're working
with because it helps us better understand
[SPEAKER_16]: our relationship.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you have to go through that
because consumers need to be protected.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not all people are operable.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even more of a reason that we need to be
purchasing from regenerated farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to start going down the roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to start buying from
regenerative farmers because regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: farming just is beyond organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that it's beyond organic is
that people are not bringing inputs in
[SPEAKER_00]: from other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not OMRI certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: When something again, I'm going to say it
again, when something is OMRI certified,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't mean that it's organically
certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that it's registered for
organic use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these awesome organic farmers,
even food farmers, are ordering these
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs that are OMRI certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those inputs are actually full of
heavy metals and toxicities that could
[SPEAKER_00]: fail your flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really need to be going beyond that,
testing our inputs, asking people from the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing that are offering it to the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are their tests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tested heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tested glyphosate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Glyphosate is something that's not being
tested, but we know over prolonged use,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're continuing to add it into our
soils, it's a fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's killing our living cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's killing our organic soils,
which is creating more problems within our
[SPEAKER_00]: crops that makes us have to add more
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why this closed loop
regenerative farming is the way to go for
[SPEAKER_00]: the future because we're realizing through
the testing, you know, where our toxicity
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are even coming from.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you're, if you're making a food
product or something with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_12]: you can have each input that you're
getting can be human grade toxicity
[SPEAKER_12]: tested.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people just go for agricultural
testing, but if you, if you have all your,
[SPEAKER_12]: all your cacao or whatever it is tested
for human grade toxicity, each
[SPEAKER_12]: manufacturer should have batch tests for
everything that you buy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that would be a good way to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: That would eliminate your, potentially
your need to have to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you all wouldn't believe the toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to human grade test every single
input that we put into all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have all of the people in
the Dempure group, if they want to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, then we add it all into a big
data form that all of us can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wouldn't believe the toxicity
that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lead levels on like alfalfa that's
OMRI certified or glyphosate levels on
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's OMRI certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that go into our soil and
into our foliar sprays that absolutely are
[SPEAKER_00]: failing our tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is the responsibility of the
cultivator from the very beginning to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to give good product to the
distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So distributors don't have these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we all need to uphold our
responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distributors already have enough paperwork
money that they're putting out that's
[SPEAKER_00]: making it almost impossible for them to
even exist in this reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to us as cultivators to give
them a good clean product that we know is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pass the flower test and the
concentrate tests.
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's our, it's a, it's a major
responsibility that we hold in our hands.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so yeah, it's, you know, I was also
going to say that it's, it's something
[SPEAKER_16]: that we, we should all welcome more
clarity on.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it, it helps us better understand what
we're putting into our plants and how
[SPEAKER_16]: that's translating into the resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I definitely don't want to consume
untested product in a way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very happy for state regulations and
that the labs at least have to have
[SPEAKER_10]: standard operating procedures and they get
spot inspections and that's all really
[SPEAKER_10]: good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've always worked in regulated
markets where third-party testing is
[SPEAKER_09]: absolutely required for the labeling
language that goes on concentrate.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's a jar that are 55% dollar bottle
of concentrate, a one gram concentrate
[SPEAKER_09]: goes on.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got batch number up there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you guys see this?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got like, you know, grapefruit,
Durbin.
[SPEAKER_09]: In Pennsylvania, like a lot of the states,
they register the testing labs to make
[SPEAKER_09]: sure that again, I don't know if they have
ISO certification for these labs yet,
[SPEAKER_09]: but certainly at some point there will be
an ISO certification process by which they
[SPEAKER_09]: go around and make sure that the labs are
generating, you know, results that are
[SPEAKER_09]: real and make sure their instruments are
properly calibrated and make sure that
[SPEAKER_09]: their analytical methods are producing
reproducible stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because again, it, it all goes onto the
label of the package that ultimately gets
[SPEAKER_09]: sold to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really important to know that
these labs are using really good methods
[SPEAKER_09]: in both Pennsylvania and in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_09]: The lab actually sends an individual to
the production facility where material is
[SPEAKER_09]: held, you know, in quarantine,
it's not packaged until it's basically
[SPEAKER_09]: tested.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this state has visibility on the
certificates of analysis for batches that
[SPEAKER_09]: are released from production into
packaging.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's a pretty tight process.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've seen it just in the time that
we've been on HashChurch.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know when we first started HashChurch,
we talked about testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God, it was, it was horrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, it was abysmal.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were labs that just were fly by
night operations that didn't have anything
[SPEAKER_09]: to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I think things have gotten a whole lot
better and I've had a great interactions
[SPEAKER_09]: with several labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not going to mention any of them by
names, but I think that there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_09]: of labs out there again.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a competitive environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shop around and yeah, I mean,
for the microbial analysis and for the
[SPEAKER_09]: other stuff that you can't do,
you know, that's just something you have
[SPEAKER_09]: to rely on a good third party testing lab.
[SPEAKER_09]: But all of the production facilities that
I've been associated with, we've all had
[SPEAKER_09]: in-house analytical.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're processing like oil and
distillate, and making CBD and isolates
[SPEAKER_09]: and diamonds and shatter, I don't know how
you operate without having those
[SPEAKER_09]: instruments.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause you're really flying blind if you
don't know what your cannabinoid levels
[SPEAKER_09]: are, especially in formulated products.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I think Debbie and 18 were
saying, you know, I mean, again,
[SPEAKER_09]: the owners used to be sort of on the
dispensary, I guess, to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_09]: results were okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's exactly 1.0 grams.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's 96% THC, whatever the
percentages are and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it seems as though, again,
the way that seed to sale and vertical
[SPEAKER_09]: integration has happened in states out
East is that everything is already in the
[SPEAKER_09]: system.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this batch of, you know, a
grapefruit, Durbin sugar, which,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, was basically back to this
barcode number there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could probably scan that barcode and
tell you when that seed was popped,
[SPEAKER_09]: when that plant material was harvest,
when that stuff was processed into live
[SPEAKER_09]: resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's gotten a lot better in terms of
just traceability and knowing that,
[SPEAKER_09]: again, when the customer goes in and buys
a $55 gram of sugar from a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_09]: what you're actually getting, because the
test results are coming from a lab that
[SPEAKER_09]: hopefully knows what the fuck we're doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, this is what I got in Maui.
[SPEAKER_15]: Last time I was on, I went to the other
dispensary, but this one I went is the
[SPEAKER_15]: good dispensary.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they actually do it seed to sale.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Chris at Maui Grown.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Chris there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris is a Hatch Church watcher.
[SPEAKER_09]: He might be watching today, Chris.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, great job, Chris.
[SPEAKER_15]: Top operation.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, of course, they do it from
absolutely seed to sale.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they actually have a lab on site and do
everything properly.
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, if you have a state card and
you go to Maui, you just have to,
[SPEAKER_09]: or any island... What's that cost,
ATN?
[SPEAKER_09]: How much did that cost?
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's it retail for?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this here?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, this was... I forget what it was.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was around... Oh, hold on.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got the receipt over here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I save everything just for shits and
giggles?
[SPEAKER_15]: This was the Huckleberry Diesel.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got a 10% discount, so it was $44.16.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was wax, Huckleberry Diesel,
80% THC, tested by... It's lab tested,
[SPEAKER_15]: and so it has a batch number.
[SPEAKER_15]: The same as when I got married in Alaska
and the dispensaries there in Alaska,
[SPEAKER_15]: they're doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just they have to literally send it
on a flight all the way to Alaska,
[SPEAKER_15]: to Nome, which is the only lab there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas in Hawaii, the lab have to be on
each island where the dispensaries are
[SPEAKER_15]: because they cannot take their cannabis
into island.
[SPEAKER_15]: It has to be where it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: So as challenging because it intercedes
with federal law.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then because no matter by air or by water,
you're still dealing with the feds.
[SPEAKER_08]: So was that a gram?
[SPEAKER_15]: A half gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I figured, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it was a half gram.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the airport can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were just mentioning inner island,
and we just wanted to let you all know to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure to be careful because Oahu is an
international airport, and because they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually are dealing with agricultural
cameras and a whole lot of agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: people, it's a different type of look-see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, everybody who's going through
Oahu without a Hawaii Cannabis Medical
[SPEAKER_00]: License, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, be really careful about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I could tell you on the other end
is they don't have testing at the airport.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell them the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wanted to let you all know that
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no testing in Oahu airport.
[SPEAKER_15]: And don't travel with anything,
people.
[SPEAKER_15]: Be smart, if you can.
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't be like us.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one thing I'd like to say back to you
is test more varieties of terpenes because
[SPEAKER_06]: most labs, the most they ever see is about
15.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark.
Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead, use that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was going to say they could
certainly test for more terpenes,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I think even if you look at this label
right here, they have, I think,
[SPEAKER_09]: six of them on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how many more you could
actually fit on a small little label.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the real question becomes with
concentrates, it's one thing, and flour,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's just a completely different beast
because it's much more dilute.
[SPEAKER_09]: But on concentrates, yeah, you could
probably reproducibly have a list of 10 to
[SPEAKER_09]: 12 to maybe 15 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a real problem with labeling and
labeling surface because there's so much
[SPEAKER_15]: verbiage that has to be put on by
standards.
[SPEAKER_15]: But companies are doing interesting things
like putting the terpenes that are in
[SPEAKER_15]: there on the inside flap.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is a little bit of that
happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we all here pretty much know that if
you know what the convalescent percentages
[SPEAKER_06]: are, especially if it's like many cases,
just TAT, and the terpene profile and
[SPEAKER_06]: percentages, you can guess pretty much
what the effects are going to be like.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I can.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can close, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think we get a measurement of like
20 or 21 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say I could look at some data,
but I think that's what we normally,
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then, yeah, we have to take a subgroup
of that and put them on the label because
[SPEAKER_09]: you can't only put so many.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm seeing 26 right now in the state
that I'm currently in right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was told that anywhere from 15 to 20,
26, but I'm seeing on most of the tests
[SPEAKER_16]: that are coming back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We tested for 50 different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: That insight would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I really look forward to the time that we
can get that type of data back because
[SPEAKER_16]: it'll just allow us to look at it in a
different way in the lab, which I really
[SPEAKER_16]: look forward to.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm using as much of that information as
we can now, but there's so much more.
[SPEAKER_09]: As interesting as information as that is
to us, us purists, and us people who want
[SPEAKER_09]: to know that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultimately, for business reasons,
it's got no solvent in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sell it.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it meets the minimum requirements to
get it out the door, the investment that's
[SPEAKER_09]: been made to get the product to that form
where it's just waiting to be packaged,
[SPEAKER_09]: waiting to be grahamed out and waiting to
be sold is just get that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put something on the label just to make us
compliant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Compliance, I guess the industry has
forced us into this.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the way we have to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: When they send a representative from the
testing lab, think about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of these cannabis facilities that
they're putting in, they're putting into
[SPEAKER_09]: areas where there's been a real hit on the
economy and some of these mill towns like
[SPEAKER_09]: in Massachusetts, or Pennsylvania,
you could imagine that putting a cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: production facility in that area is just a
big economic shot in the arm because now
[SPEAKER_09]: you have these production jobs,
you're producing a high quality product,
[SPEAKER_09]: but the testing labs typically has always
been around population centers.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you think about Pennsylvania,
just for example, population centers out
[SPEAKER_09]: west, you have Pittsburgh, and out east,
you have Philly.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the middle, you have what we call
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pennsylvania is where most of the
production goes on, but the testing is
[SPEAKER_09]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: The logistics of having to get testing
personnel there all gowned up in a
[SPEAKER_09]: facility, badged in, wanded in,
they probably have to have a background
[SPEAKER_09]: check to let somebody in those facilities
because now, ooh, they're touching the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually have to go in there and take
these samples and then bring them back to
[SPEAKER_09]: the lab, which is 50 miles away or 80
miles away or God knows how many.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the whole logistics of that holds up
production because as you're producing and
[SPEAKER_09]: as you're growing and extracting and
making product and making formulated
[SPEAKER_09]: product, ultimately, you're at the mercy
of the regulation that's in the state to
[SPEAKER_09]: keep your license to make sure you're
operating compliantly and you have all the
[SPEAKER_09]: information that needs to go on the label
so that product can be legally stored or
[SPEAKER_09]: sold at the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: The alcohol industry is regulated and it's
always interesting to transpose the
[SPEAKER_09]: alcohol industry onto the cannabis
industry to ask, well, what would they do
[SPEAKER_09]: with alcohol here?
[SPEAKER_09]: How would they regulate alcohol?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that's really very,
very pertinent around hemp because hemp
[SPEAKER_09]: was made legal so that the farm bill
basically said these varieties of cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: where you have low THC cultivars and
you're basically only making CBD,
[SPEAKER_09]: these things are now legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: But now what complicates things always,
things are never as easy as they're
[SPEAKER_09]: supposed to be, is the fact that even on
an acre of that 0.3 hemp, you have
[SPEAKER_09]: somewhere between three to six pounds of
THC Did they forget that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we don't talk about that,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to change the subject now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_09]: A big driver now in the hemp industry is
having tea-free product or what's called
[SPEAKER_09]: THC-free distillate for being able to,
again, be compliant with the farm bill
[SPEAKER_09]: because again, in the farm bill,
you're basically saying that this product
[SPEAKER_09]: is legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, anything extracted from the
product is illegal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it's fractionated to a point where
now the percentages make them not legal,
[SPEAKER_09]: how is that dealt with in a way that
becomes regulatory compliant?
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, Marcus, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how you- Every state is
different and that's what's really
[SPEAKER_12]: confusing about it right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: They changed the total THC limit in the US
and that's what really, on October 31st
[SPEAKER_12]: and so it kind of sent the hemp industry
for a loop in the US, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are they doing with the recovered
THC?
[SPEAKER_09]: So the point is no matter how low they
make the limit, if there's still going to
[SPEAKER_09]: be THC as part of the fraction of stuff
that comes from that extraction,
[SPEAKER_09]: how is that regulated?
[SPEAKER_09]: How is it dealt with?
[SPEAKER_12]: They just give you a minimum number of
what's available and they allow you to
[SPEAKER_12]: operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got all this excess THC,
but you're supposed to be a hemp farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not supposed to have that THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go back with what Marcus
said and we're just not going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that today.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you should raise the THC limit to
1% because that's what good medicine is.
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole idea that we're going to be
producing high fluid and getting medicine
[SPEAKER_12]: out to the masses is really kind of not
worth it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So whole plant medicine with THC numbers
that are in the regulations is really what
[SPEAKER_12]: we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_12]: We need endophenic fungi and bacteria
along with cannabinoids and terpenes in
[SPEAKER_12]: our medicine in order to make proper hemp
medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm really excited about new studies
coming out about the effects of endophenic
[SPEAKER_12]: fungi and endophenic bacteria that are
present within the plant that are outside
[SPEAKER_12]: of the realms of cannabinoids and
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are actually producing cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: Incredibly medicinal and we've talked
about it on here before, but there are
[SPEAKER_12]: newer studies and there's not a lot known
about endophenic fungi and endophenic
[SPEAKER_12]: bacteria in cannabis at the moment.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some hemp studies done and you
can extract endophenic fungi and bacteria
[SPEAKER_12]: and create products like antifungal sprays
and different things like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that term endophenic?
[SPEAKER_09]: Explain what that term means.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know what that term means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endo, as you know, being a scientist means
inside and phytic meaning fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually the microbiome of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a lot about the microbiome of the
soil, but now we're really starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: look into the microbiome of the plant,
which is the education that Josh and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have been talking about forever,
but now it's just being matched with
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are looking at cannabis and
studying the endophytic reaction because
[SPEAKER_00]: what we know of the yew tree and the
production of taxol was it wasn't just the
[SPEAKER_00]: cambium layer inside of the tree that was
giving the taxol, which is the medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the endophytes that were inside of
the tree that were creating the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're really starting to understand
the microbiome of the plant producing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and the terpenes and the
medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Endophytes are coming from the soil and
outside they're going into the plant
[SPEAKER_12]: through the plant blood.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going into the leaves,
the shoots, the roots, all different
[SPEAKER_12]: aspects of the plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: They go into the cells and they're like a
free associating compound that goes into
[SPEAKER_12]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: So endophytes are really really
interesting and there is some new
[SPEAKER_12]: information coming out on hemp plants and
extracting endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like when we find what we have
now in the scientific frontier is that
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're testing people's microbiome,
which is their microbiome, their
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytic system is that there's cancers
and IBS and Crohn's disease and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these horrible maladies that humans are
facing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we test the microbiome of the
human, we're realizing a tremendous amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of beneficial endophytes or microbiology
that's not present within the human.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can take this studies to the
cannabis plant and realize, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there is leaf-eating mildew that's
happening, we can look within the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome to see what is missing within
the plant that helps really fight that
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Josh said that it's found within the
soil, but there's also a DNA twist in it
[SPEAKER_00]: just like humans is that there's also
endophytes that are coming within the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be carried on not only
through DNA, but also through
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's everything about life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that term.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I like that too.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a regenerative agriculture podcast
on with Dr. White.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can listen to, it's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's gonna be speaking at the Science
Regenerative Cannabis Conference coming up
[SPEAKER_12]: soon.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's been studying endophytes for 40
years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so as Dr. Efrens in Oregon with
mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's really interesting how the roots
have the fungal filaments hairs and how
[SPEAKER_12]: those hairs exude the compounds that
attract the bacteria and fungi to them.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they dissolve and synthesize
those compounds into the fungal filament
[SPEAKER_12]: roots and they put them into themselves
and they pulse that medicine through the
[SPEAKER_12]: plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it creates nutrients and it creates
medicine within the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, we can grow a plant
hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we won't have as much endophytes and
as much nutrients within the tomato plant
[SPEAKER_12]: or the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's this complex matrix of rich soil
that allows the roots to become more
[SPEAKER_12]: complex and create more nutrient dense,
more medicine in our plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the goal of our whole entire
succession of our species.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the point of evolution that we
can't lose.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what's happening in the forest.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what's happening in our wild areas.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what we need to try and create
biomimicry in our gardens and moving
[SPEAKER_12]: forward.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we think that's how we're gonna
succeed.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how we're smart.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how our brain can function
properly.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's organic soil, intentional
production, going into plants and then
[SPEAKER_12]: coming out with products that can heal the
masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can even take it one step
further and you could say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if we're finding in,
you know, people that have heavy maladies,
[SPEAKER_00]: improper balanced microbiome, then what
happens if we all get back to soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if we're all playing in the
soil and we're just even growing our
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes in our own backyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're able to uptake that
microbiology and we're realizing that that
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology that comes from the soil is a
tremendous intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is it going into our body and
it's helping us to heal maladies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also helping us to make proper
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that us as a species,
you know, maybe we're making a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: improper decisions because a lot of us are
hosting the composting microbiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones are the heavy duty pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe we need more beneficials
to be able to make better medicines.
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to become a super T cell and
enhance that within our body.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it starts now, it's springtime.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're about ready to start seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're about ready to take clones.
[SPEAKER_12]: We should talk as a community.
[SPEAKER_12]: How do we start seeds without the washes
and crazy things we need to start?
[SPEAKER_12]: Start seeds with the ultimate amount of
biology possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when the first root comes out,
it's going to take a DNA imprint of what's
[SPEAKER_12]: possible in that soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're saying start your seeds with a
moon cycle.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're saying start clones and natural
soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't use rapid rooters and spongy clone
mediums because those spongy clone mediums
[SPEAKER_12]: are not approved for organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of those spongy clone mediums have
inorganic compounds that are used as
[SPEAKER_12]: binders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we talked about before with the
polymers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy duty polymers and those that make
some spongy as well as formaldehyde,
[SPEAKER_00]: which keeps it a preservative.
[SPEAKER_12]: So root riot and rapid rooters are not
approved for organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_12]: We should be looking to make clones with
soil blockers and create our own mix of
[SPEAKER_12]: maybe a cocoa compost 50-50 blend or a
peat cocoa 50-50 blend or our own dirt
[SPEAKER_12]: from our greenhouse 50-50 blend to where
it's not super biological rich because you
[SPEAKER_12]: don't want to eat up the stem with biology
when you put it in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you want a kind of halfway inert mix
for clones.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're opening up the conversation
towards how to start clones and seeds
[SPEAKER_12]: biologically for the betterment of healthy
medicine and nutrition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for the drop.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, everyone, thanks for the drop
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like some good information going
down on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been three hours and I'm going to
call it a day for the first Hash Church
[SPEAKER_08]: back since the hacking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely going to come back next week
and invite all of you and anyone else that
[SPEAKER_08]: wants to come and join us.
[SPEAKER_08]: This Zoom allows us to have many,
many more people in the room than the old
[SPEAKER_08]: methodology.
[SPEAKER_08]: But thanks to Dragonfly Earth Medicine for
dropping in and dropping bombs and
[SPEAKER_08]: knowledge and just being all around good
folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you as well, Jack, Phillips,
for the short share.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get you back again next week too.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell us more about what's going on
and what you're doing and it's fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: super awesome work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's in denial of what you're doing is
the front lines work with cannabis on the
[SPEAKER_08]: opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty amazing, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wade, as always, super pleasure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for telling us the good news,
the bad news.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really good to hear about the Caladrius
Network.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to hear about your projects in Utah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're always happy to have you here
sharing your knowledge with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know anytime, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real treat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Colin, thank you for coming in and
dropping some knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And getting the conversation going and
always being a part of things and being a
[SPEAKER_08]: bubble ambassador out there in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for the platform and
just being a part of it and being a good
[SPEAKER_16]: friend, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark, you definitely were the a couple of
times that I had to write times down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, that's going to be like
the 30 second clip of the of like what
[SPEAKER_08]: he's going to do for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little thank you for awesome sharing and
really.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I appreciate your time more than you
can imagine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for all your love.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, everything that you do to be you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you make you make this possible,
you know, and your dedication.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's like when you got hacked,
we all felt like we all got hacked,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, so we're we we feel you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, when we mishash church,
when it's not around and everybody is in
[SPEAKER_09]: chat, it's funny because you almost wonder
what they don't do on Sunday when there's
[SPEAKER_09]: no hash church.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like I wonder what Bingo does.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like that's funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a great group of people like our
friend Sloth out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all got your back.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just great to have this this
network and this this venue.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for what you do, Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank Skunkman Sam for coming as
always got pretty pretty excited in the in
[SPEAKER_08]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: You had so much to share.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you calmed down and I always
appreciate your bluntness.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I always know you speak from the
heart.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even though sometimes it comes across
very sharp, you're not sharp.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like a loving cannabis warrior.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love you for it, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for coming in as always.
[SPEAKER_06]: I posted I just posted a paper on
microbeal and the role of endo fights in
[SPEAKER_06]: modulating the production of secondary
metabolic microbiology.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to Google it now, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just it's no you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the chat room in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Colin, he just sent it in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll read that, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank Johnny fucking B for
always being the best for always being so
[SPEAKER_08]: kind for just being a pure hearted human
being and a good brother to me and to
[SPEAKER_08]: everyone, really an inspiration,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks for sharing your time with us,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're muted, brother.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_18]: When this all happened, it was it was that
Saturday and watched it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was just like just going through
this and everything we've been through and
[SPEAKER_18]: everything we've done.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was kind of like.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then watching the videos coming down
and everything we were doing, it was like,
[SPEAKER_18]: wow, and just just being through
everything that we've done together and
[SPEAKER_18]: just just being such a big part of
everybody in this group and and just
[SPEAKER_18]: watching that history disappear and just
and like talking.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was in, you know, in videos,
I was on campus culture news live
[SPEAKER_18]: discussing what's going on with
everything, just making such awareness of
[SPEAKER_18]: what was happening with this.
[SPEAKER_18]: And everybody was plugging away in the
postings are going wild.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was it was good support and being
able to actually, you know, you talk with
[SPEAKER_18]: D420K and just just going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then that that smile.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're back.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that picture of you is the happiest I
have seen you like when your kid was born.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_18]: There's those days, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that smile just put the biggest smile
on my face.
[SPEAKER_18]: And and same time, my heart was ripped
out, too, because all those those those
[SPEAKER_18]: those special videos, even coming to the
hospital and seeing in the hospital when
[SPEAKER_18]: that one was gone, I was just like,
it broke my heart.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just like those were those times
that were were just like moments in time.
[SPEAKER_18]: That one that we get back.
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, you're here strong.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_18]: Just Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're back in Hashturch.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I got your hash talks and more to
come.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going to be just an amazing.
[SPEAKER_18]: We talked about it at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then this all happened.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're still we're still on.
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks so much for always being here first
and always stay in almost last.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've always your work ethic is above and
beyond.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just great to have you in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised I didn't meet you earlier in
the industry, but I've known you for long
[SPEAKER_08]: enough that you're a great brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Hashturch would never be the same
without you sharing all the great
[SPEAKER_08]: information that you come and share.
[SPEAKER_08]: And your information is so great.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all like from from your experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you've been walking the walk and
talking the talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do appreciate you for that,
my good man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, humbly.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's I just enjoy coming here and
learning here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I got to give a shout out to my boys,
Michael Kravitz and the other people who
[SPEAKER_15]: were out at the U.N.
[SPEAKER_15]: trying and trying the flipping the World
Health Organization.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the delayed vote is now happening in
December now.
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is what they have and they're
putting out now.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the next 10 years regarding
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is a book that's out highly
recommended.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a lot of good stuff, a lot of good
information.
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot of things still happening on
cannabis at the international end.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not over yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, again, much love to Michael Kravitz
and them and hope they're able to get it
[SPEAKER_15]: done in December.
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot to go still.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they actually flip the 1961
convention, that will be an opening to the
[SPEAKER_15]: entire world for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: So keep up the great work, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: We love and support what you do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just humbled being here learning.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time that I'm here.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just it's just fun being here.
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is it available?
[SPEAKER_15]: Michael gave me a copy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw him right before he left for Geneva,
Vienna.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they were in Vienna this week.
[SPEAKER_15]: So he gave me a copy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure where it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Cannabis and Sustainable
Development.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the FAAAT edition.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's paving the way for the next decade in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And hemp policy.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a think tank out of Vienna.
[SPEAKER_15]: So FAAAT.net.
[SPEAKER_15]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try.
[SPEAKER_08]: Throw it up in the link.
[SPEAKER_08]: Throw it up in the link.
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, I want to thank Debbie Goldsberry,
who is no longer here, but is probably
[SPEAKER_08]: rocking and rolling and doing something
awesome as she has been for such a long
[SPEAKER_08]: time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I better stop Sam's video or he'll be
showing his face there for a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, thanks, everyone, for watching.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's in the room right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the chatter is slothy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you're feeling better in the
hospital and RIP to sub cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, everyone, for coming and hanging
out for Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_16]: Big love and hugs, everyone.
[SPEAKER_16]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_16]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_16]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_16]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_16]: Peace.
