[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome, welcome, welcome to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_12]: I myself am just freshly back from a
camping trip.
[SPEAKER_12]: So give me a little bit of time and I'll
get everyone invited in for the link.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope everyone's having a good Father's
Day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out
there, of course.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, we're gonna have a nice little
episode today.
[SPEAKER_12]: So stick around.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see what we gotta do here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We gotta copy this.
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited for today's episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: Looking forward to talking a little with
Tim Blake and Alec from SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Todd McCormick helped set that up,
so we're very happy that he did.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so we will send the link out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I see Todd and Tim and Etienne have seen
it, so we could probably expect them in
[SPEAKER_12]: the near future.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, we got a whole bunch of people
holding down the chat room right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice to see, nice to see.
[SPEAKER_12]: And absolutely happy Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you all for the Father's Day
blessings that you have passed my way.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, happy Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, how's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy Father's Day to you and all the
fathers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had my thing turned off.
[SPEAKER_12]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said happy Father's Day to you and all
the fathers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we are on a beautiful Sunday
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, early, before noon, actually.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 9 a.m., but somewhere it's afternoon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Somewhere it's afternoon.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing, Todd?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm melting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Melting?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it like 107 degrees?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's damn warm.
[SPEAKER_12]: Forrest hit me up this morning and he was
just like, dude, I wish I was a little
[SPEAKER_12]: higher north today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm with him at that point right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_12]: He said it was 107 or 108 degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a multiple.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's that's like hot yoga.
[SPEAKER_12]: You you heat up a room to do hot yoga.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it's just not cool right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a faddy for Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: A faddy for Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a faddy for your father today.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is in memory of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine passed away this year, my stepfather,
who was really my father.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is my first one without him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much love to Joe, my family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_12]: I might need to make a new message today.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if anyone got those.
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just sent it to Tim and Alex as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had sent it to them as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think the way it happened this
morning that things did not get sent the
[SPEAKER_12]: way they should have gotten sent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it should be a good conversation today.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to come on and we're going
to talk about the way they're doing their
[SPEAKER_11]: new test for the the country fair that's
happening in Leytonville in July.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've broken the categories into five
different categories based on terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, you said that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That looks really cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that was neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is a that would be a first of
its kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave that up to the people at the Emile
Cup, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have to push, you know,
it's good to see things pushing in a
[SPEAKER_03]: different direction, at least challenging
the status quo.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're defining cannabis culture in a lot
of ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: They are not waiting for permission.
[SPEAKER_11]: They are actually coming out and doing it
really well.
[SPEAKER_11]: This new event that they're doing is based
solely on organic horticulture,
[SPEAKER_11]: which I think is really great.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the old timer stepping up and
saying, hey, we have to be stewards of the
[SPEAKER_11]: environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to pay attention to what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's fantastic personally.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's nice to see them changing it up
and doing something a little bit
[SPEAKER_12]: different.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, the importance of terpenes,
as we have learned in the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, welcome, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we have to be stewards of the
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to pay attention to what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like deja vu.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was such a weird deja vu.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, I've heard this before.
[SPEAKER_12]: The importance of terpenes that we've
learned.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, he's still gone.
[SPEAKER_12]: I keep repeating the same shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll just mute him.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll just mute him.
[SPEAKER_12]: He'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: The terpenes are where the terps are where
it's at.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they're definitely a part of it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: A very important part that maybe for a
long time, we weren't quite as aware of.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seems like the community is becoming more
and more aware.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tim's here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, welcome, Tim.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can hear you, Tim.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy Father's Day, Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Father's Day to you too.
[SPEAKER_11]: We only got you for an hour, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'd love to give you the floor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you please tell us a little bit
about what you're doing up in
[SPEAKER_11]: Leightonville and the new Country Fair?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we wanted to ask you about the
new competition and how you are breaking
[SPEAKER_11]: it into terpenes and that you've changed
the categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, can you guys hear me good?
[SPEAKER_10]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on is that I've been
calling the Emerald Cup of Canada's
[SPEAKER_00]: Country Fair for 14 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we do it in the wintertime
where it's not the best weather for a fair
[SPEAKER_00]: type environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've talked with Jonathan Baldwin a few
years back, and he held the domain name
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a friend of mine wanted to come along
and try to do that last year at Black Oak
[SPEAKER_00]: Ranch and failed kind of miserably with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went back and said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to do that and make something
good for the Emerald Triangle people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the community of Mendocino because they're
all kind of disappointed we took the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Cup out of the triangle and down
to Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought we'd bring something back
home for everybody up here and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend event where you can camp out and
actually hang with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Emerald Cup and a lot of
these competitions and shows, they're so
[SPEAKER_00]: hectic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're running your booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You barely have a chance to even spend
five minutes with anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hardly even see anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to go back and see who showed up
through all the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, OK, let's do a weekend
event where people stay for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make it a really community based
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll bring the best of the Emerald
Triangle vendors in and we'll do a new
[SPEAKER_00]: type of competition that we will want to
do out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dixon's been bugging me forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought we'd do all that and put a
great show together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm working with some new partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very quiet and they they never use
their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not even supposed to really honor
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you look at the the
introduction for the Cannabis Country
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair, we really didn't even introduce them
and except for very vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they're quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not ego based.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with a new group of people out
of red light management, the guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered Dave Matthews.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most respected talent agency in
the world for music.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also are part partners in many
festivals, but they don't put their name
[SPEAKER_00]: on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not ego based.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gentleman who owns the thing privately
never puts his name into anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm probably going to get a little
flack for even going into this much
[SPEAKER_00]: because, like I said, they're just a very
quiet, reserved company, but they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuart Ross, who produced the first three
hundred sixty Lollapalooza is helping
[SPEAKER_00]: manage the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is to turn it into like a
Lollapalooza and take it around the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And integrate alternative lifestyles and
the agricultural techniques and the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and everything that we do and
take it around and show it off to Michigan
[SPEAKER_00]: and the East Coast and down south and
Texas and stuff, because that's what they
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Charlie Hernandez, who's out
with you two right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's produced and production managed,
I'm sorry, all the farm aid shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on the board of directors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was out with Neil.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the production manager for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some issues last year with the
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we all know, it got out of control with
so many people coming in and we extended
[SPEAKER_00]: the contest accidentally, which gave us a
train wreck with eight hundred fifty
[SPEAKER_00]: entries the last three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though we had a good experience
with our partners last year, we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to work with Red Light and
come in and bring them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided that we wanted to move up
to the next level so that we could be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hold up to that standard is the
best show in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got Charlie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Stuart with us for the Cannabis
Country Fair and the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another partner, Red Light,
Jim Louie, who's helping produce the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He created a festival back in the 80s
called the Horn Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked with Ernie Azoff for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody there is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an incredible individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Father's Day to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's this new team that we're coming
together with the Cannabis Country Fair so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can take it on the road and work
with people like you and everybody else to
[SPEAKER_00]: help showcase who we are.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Tim, there's a long way to
answer, but there's not.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not a better example of culture
I'd like to see demonstrated around the
[SPEAKER_11]: country than what you've done with the
with the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure what will happen with the
country fair.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, even though you say it's gotten
out of control, it is the most community
[SPEAKER_11]: based event, in my opinion, that you can
attend anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: You go to places like in Europe,
everybody comes from everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's just such a core group
community with what you're doing that I
[SPEAKER_11]: just think is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, that word out of control,
maybe that's a little heavy handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get that many people,
we've learned things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we had 300 extra people that
tried to get into Damian Marley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've never had a problem in the past
because by the end of the night,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many people that are so high
they don't even want to go to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we let the first 3500 in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been a problem because it's
just worked this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 400 people wanted to see Damian and
they came you just see Damian and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: sad because they couldn't get in there and
the fairgrounds wouldn't open up and let
[SPEAKER_00]: those extra few hundred people in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the contest was kind of a
challenge because so many late entries,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get 850 entries the last three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how can people judge that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we changed the rules for the Emerald
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to shorten the timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give the testing a lot more
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give the judges clean
medicine and we're going to rectify
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that wasn't perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be an eight cylinder car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're running on seven cylinders,
it still won't be a perfect ride,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's running almost perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Emerald Cup, from what everybody
saw, really went well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see the few things we're going to
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting with the cannabis
country fair to get them all in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds like you got the right people on
board, Tim.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great to see.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They vetted out about 140 cannabis
companies and they decided they wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very proud and honored to have
them with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really still the Emerald Cup
presenting a cannabis country fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to know that they're the ones helping
with the show, the organization and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot, gives me a lot of comfort that we
can deal with the other aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's a key aspect and that's needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did the Horde tour myself many
moons ago in a galaxy far, far away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I know the professionalism that
goes into it and what's needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a very well-run gig
altogether.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just from the listing of the cadre you
have there, it's quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's great because it shows that
you're taking it serious and vendors want
[SPEAKER_03]: to know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that attend don't really
understand what happens around in the
[SPEAKER_03]: backwoods of what actually takes and
transpires.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an idea of thrown events,
not, of course, of this caliber.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's great, Tim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for coming on and
making us well aware of what's
[SPEAKER_03]: transpiring.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for stepping up your own
game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a question for you, Tim.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam here.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm interested in is you're saying
that there will be five dominant terpene
[SPEAKER_07]: varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: The contest between picking out the best
of these five different terpene dominant
[SPEAKER_07]: varieties, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And are those going to be type one,
type two or type three plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, THC, CBD and THC or CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're not going to do CBD for this
contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to tighten up and just go with
Concentrates and Light Depot and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: small contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a last minute show that we put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other events.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Dougie doing Chalice down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought we'd just start with a
small contest, stay out of people's way,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just keep going with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ways you can run
the contest.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you say a terpene dominant variety,
you mean also a THC dominant variety with
[SPEAKER_07]: a terpene dominant.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds really good because I was
worried that you were going to mix up the
[SPEAKER_07]: three type one, type two and type three
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would have been crazy because how
can you compare a CBD variety to a THC
[SPEAKER_07]: variety side by side just by terpene
content?
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, I'm mixed up enough and I
think everybody else is, so we don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: to do any more than we already got.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much for us to learn and be
educated on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpene dominance, that is the future for
sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the five terpene.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to give a shout out really
quickly to Kevin Jodrie and the Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Tarp who basically started this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, with Dominic Corpia with the
Turpa Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got Jeremy Plume and Jesse
Dodd up there with the Cold Cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three groups really spearheaded
the direction of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though Alec Dixon has been bugging me
for years to go in this direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: they jumped in and did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really a big shout out to Kevin
Jodrie and the folks at Wonderland and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Tarp that really spearheaded that
up in Garberville.
[SPEAKER_07]: And does that have to be a natural
extraction from plant material or can it
[SPEAKER_07]: be fabricated with natural terpenes and
THC distillate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're doing a separate distillate
contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a CO2 contest and the
concentrate contest will all be natural
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distillate contest, we're opening that
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're recognizing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I tried Tony Mendicino,
who's the creator of the Skittles and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot and Fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an ethanol cartridge that,
boy, I finally found a cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have CO2 cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this ethanol distillate cart was just
stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was the first thing I'd ever
tasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which had expansion, actually almost
tasted like you were smoking a joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for the clean taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hit well all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the future is obviously going to be
ethanol distillates for the cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're bringing that distillate
contest in to recognize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though ethanol is still considered a
violent solvent, we got to get realistic
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even exane and propane and butane are
going to be allowed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bringing them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state's going to allow them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under the right conditions,
these are going to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to let them into the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just waiting for the legalization to
come in.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the THC level of ethanol cartridge
like this?
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, if you looked at it as THC
as a percentage of the weight or volume,
[SPEAKER_07]: what is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the first real ethanol carts
that I'd seen come in and there wasn't any
[SPEAKER_00]: information with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hitting them for the last couple
of weeks and trying them out with
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody that I know, all the hardcore
people that don't want cartridges in their
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all going, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably I'd probably hit this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, oh, my gosh, this is
really I'm doing as much as I can on
[SPEAKER_07]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because 20 years ago, we tried an ethanol
extracted from resin material.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it worked pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I myself personally, I couldn't handle
it was ethanol.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't all based, but it was nebulized
with ultrasonics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, leave it to the brilliant
people of this country and this world to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out new ways to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we've gone from,
you know, where I come from, just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, puffing on joints to where
you've got the leading scientists in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world figuring out how to do all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so far beyond me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, my hat's off to all of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I ask you, Tim, what was these five
terpenes that you're going with,
[SPEAKER_11]: terpenolene, pionene, limonene,
carafalene, and mercine?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are those the five most prominent terpenes
in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, according to Alec Dixon and SC Labs
and what they're doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got so many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that, you know, talking to
Alec, he thought that we could have them
[SPEAKER_00]: all fall into those ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course, I defer to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be the ones that separate
the the entries into into the categories
[SPEAKER_00]: for our judges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, looking at it, you know,
like I said, there's so much to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing the cup, you know,
just everything against itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have a best morning bud contest
so that the Blue Dreams and stuff would
[SPEAKER_00]: have a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very different structure of how
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that it works so well that we
can bring it right into the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives a lot more room for different
strains to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how's a Blue Dream or a train
wreck?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about that in the judging
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is a stunning Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going to beat up fuel,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives all those different strains
a chance to compete, to get honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with the concentrates going
in that direction so much, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: who wants to just, you know, hit a dab of
OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for cookies, you're looking
for Skittles, you're looking for Durbin
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherwood of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the concentrates, these even
more pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to really recognize that what
we're looking for are these terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's honor them and give everybody
a chance to to win prizes off of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would agree with most of the terpenes
you pick, but karyophylline does not
[SPEAKER_07]: potentially potentiate or modulate THC as
far as I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I tried it and I couldn't get it to
modulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not so much about the modulation,
correct, Tim?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more about the the expressions that
are shown in the tests that SC Labs is
[SPEAKER_11]: doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's more running all these tests.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're seeing karyophylline and things
like Gorilla Glue, Chem, Girl Scout,
[SPEAKER_11]: Cookie Sherbert, Skittles, the stuff that
there's the Cannabis Country Fair has a
[SPEAKER_11]: really good page on this listed under
contest.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it talks about the different
categories for the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Alex is supposed to be joining us as
well today.
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe we can get more information out
of him, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: He is he is brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what Alec and Josh and the
guys at SC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they have put it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of different ways you
can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could have expanded this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then how do you how do you close down
the contest?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only so many terpenes with
modulation and potentiation.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the terpenes do not modulate and
do not potentiate THC, for example.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you might want to start with those
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we should get you on a panel talking
about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in Europe and I don't think I'll
come to California just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's an extended offer if you
ever want to come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I think talking about this
is how people are going to be educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of education that needs
to take place.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know a lot of people say that
karyophylline is important for medicinal
[SPEAKER_07]: use because it's it's a CB2 binder.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you want to get high, you don't
want a CB2 binder.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want a CB1 binder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like I said, we're all going to
go through this contest together and then
[SPEAKER_00]: go through the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be something that
everybody's going to really learn a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about, because really, as I go out there
and talk to people, there's so little
[SPEAKER_00]: information that people that people really
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're sitting here talking about
it, but most people are still in the dark.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are the concentrates going to be in the
same categories?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates can be broken down into
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is they had to convince me to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, oh, my gosh, this is like,
you know, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cat is country fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the concentrates,
look at all the flavors that are coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: and chirping profiles that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really naturally breaks down into
those categories, too, as far as winners
[SPEAKER_00]: and what people are looking for.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with you, Tim.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a natural way to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What would be kind of interesting is if
they would also besides a printout of the
[SPEAKER_07]: terpene and cannabinoid content of the
extract, also have it of the original herb
[SPEAKER_07]: the extract was taken from, so that you
could see what has altered in the extract
[SPEAKER_07]: versus the original herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm talking about altering the
cannabinoid or terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a very good suggestion,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I wish we had more time before this
contest to have taken a lot of this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony's came on very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this from a running start.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tony did a little bit through SC labs with
Blue River, where they tested the bud and
[SPEAKER_12]: then they tested the terpene profile of
the terpenes that were extracted.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was there were little, little minor
changes, but fairly accurate.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely a good idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends how rough your extraction is.
[SPEAKER_07]: The sesquiterpene stick around much
stronger than the monoterpene.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're really, really gentle,
the monoterp should be all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all there and pretty close to the
original profile as in the herb.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the ones that I saw, there were
just a few that had actually like one had
[SPEAKER_12]: disappeared and a new one had shown up
terpene, which was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe Alec can talk about it when he gets
in from Messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Cultivation Classic guys up
there, Jeremy and the Philos people with
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it all in Cultivation Classic and
you can see how it fits and where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going and how the genetic background goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're going to see more of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to bring that into the
cup this year as an educational piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's so different than all being
back in the woods, just where the contest
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: Will you have a category for pure
terpenes, cannabis derived, unadulterated,
[SPEAKER_12]: no concentrate, no cannabinoids,
no herb, just terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not doing it to the campus
country fair, but I believe we'll do that
[SPEAKER_00]: at the animal cup.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're going to expand that out
because we wanted to make sure we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: make one mistake with this contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a new set of parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, let's just keep it small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this together and do this
because we went back and forth on how many
[SPEAKER_00]: other contests people wanted us to add a
bunch of other contests in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just work with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll head to the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it done and we'll just expand
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a really good suggestion on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talked about it, I think it should
be in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good idea to build your foundation,
you know, a little simpler and not too
[SPEAKER_12]: overly complex, because as we know with
cannabis and getting into terpenes,
[SPEAKER_12]: especially the holy smokes, you could go
deep.
[SPEAKER_12]: It could get complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all of this is complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This contest is complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's like, I can't even keep track
of all the prizes and the contest and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're bringing these,
these, you know, heavyweights in here to
[SPEAKER_00]: just make sure it all runs right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I tip my hat to you, sir.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, you know, you've been doing a great
job, obviously.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear great things about the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of the events that I cannot
believe I haven't been to in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: community.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hopefully one day, one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we'll get you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got an extended VIP tickets for
yourself too.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so cool, Tim.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark's been at this a while, so I can't
visit Mark because of my cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: convictions.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mark can't visit me because so we've
both been bumped on the Canadian border.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a lot of why I used to do house
church because it gave me time to just sit
[SPEAKER_11]: and smoke with Mark.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it sounds funny, but it was,
I can't, other than meeting him in Europe
[SPEAKER_11]: at a coffee shop, I don't get to spend
quality time with my friend.
[SPEAKER_11]: For Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't gotten high with Mark and
Jamaica yet, but I'm down.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we'll be doing that soon.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead, Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's just so much going on in
Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could get up there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got convictions and so I can't get,
I'm hoping with the unfoldment
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, they'll open that all up
now.
[SPEAKER_12]: We will meet in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim, tell everybody where to get
information if they're interested in going
[SPEAKER_03]: to your event, where is it going to be
held?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the dates?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do they find out more information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the dates are July 21st,
22nd, 23rd of this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be at the Historic Black Oak
Ranch.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Mendocino County, it's 10 miles north
of Lakeville, right on the highway there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the information at
cannabiscountryfair.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get tickets at Eventbrite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have tickets in the stores
throughout Northern California over the
[SPEAKER_00]: next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a beautiful 80 acre
ranch with a river going through it that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going to be camping on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a wonderful outdoor
camping event for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cools down at night so the weather's
not hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an amazing lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these guys at Red Light,
I didn't know half these bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I go out and try to book our
acts and then people, they'll tell us yes
[SPEAKER_00]: or no, but we'll get one-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Light goes out and every available
comes to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got an act that is blowing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're number one in the country on
Alternative Rock called Portugal the Man,
[SPEAKER_00]: who I don't even know who that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course we got Fever
Corporation, which just did a new record.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were down in Jamaica putting that
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing some tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got Beats Antique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we've got White Denim and Alan
Stone, Jamestown Revival, Anders Osborn,
[SPEAKER_00]: who I didn't even know about, who I know
and one of my new favorites.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That guy is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told by one of my record store
people that take tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, you got to go listen to Anders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh, I've been so busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a chance to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, you got to listen to this
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went and listened to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, man, the guy is
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys are all headliners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all playing third,
fourth in the lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they hit it out of the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spent more money than I do on the
Emerald Cup for the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a great lineup for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some great speakers coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really just a comfortable place to
hang out with people for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's almost like we're turning.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like these cannabis events are really
going to sort of take over what a concert
[SPEAKER_12]: used to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to a concert and drink a beer and
watch Roger Waters play his songs.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, no, now there's like speakers.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's an event.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cannabis based.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a little competition.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's it's just such a better thing to
have these amazing bands play at these
[SPEAKER_12]: events, but make it still, you know,
focused on that plant that we all love.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the county fair.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's natural.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to always go to county fairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very agriculturally orientated,
both animals and plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, can we talk about a little bit?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an organic based fair.
[SPEAKER_11]: I read on your website, you're not even
you don't even want to accept applications
[SPEAKER_11]: from nutrient companies that don't have
organic lines.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you talk a little bit more about
that, Tim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're really stepping out with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not calling anybody out,
but we're looking at what the state's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to demand next year in terms of
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the environmental
issues and the patients issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just drawing a line and saying
that we need to provide organic medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: to our patients and for our farms and for
our communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just can't stand down from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just now going to demand that
everybody coming into the Canada's Country
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair and the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have all the all the food
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all the entries organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've given some people leeway as far as
vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're drawing a line in the sand and
saying, look, if you want to be with us
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want us to represent you,
then you're going to have to be organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what we're saying we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we let all these groups slip in
that aren't people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come to us and they say,
well, we thought they were organic because
[SPEAKER_00]: they were with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're vouching for these companies
in effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you represent to me the old school
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I first went up there in 94 and I
spent my first summer up there growing
[SPEAKER_11]: with Richard Davis, you remember Richard
Davis.
[SPEAKER_11]: He had the museum.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he was a hero.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you guys had such a different
consideration for the environment around
[SPEAKER_11]: you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You were not polluters.
[SPEAKER_11]: You were not trash in the place.
[SPEAKER_11]: You were not clear cutting to put up
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was such a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the guys growing at the normal
meetings and the activism I did with the
[SPEAKER_11]: same people I saw at the Earth First stuff
that was standing up and trying to stop
[SPEAKER_11]: the loggers.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then a whole new generation of people
seemed to come in after Proposition 215
[SPEAKER_11]: passed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it took a very different vibe.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it broke my heart in a lot of,
you know, I'm not religious, but going up
[SPEAKER_11]: to those trees, it's like a spiritual
experience, you know, Northern California.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just really happy that you have
this voice of reason and that you're
[SPEAKER_11]: bringing back this consciousness of,
hey, we have to be stewards of the land.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to take care of each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the community element of this so
much, Tim.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope people really hear that and get
that and understand that that's been a big
[SPEAKER_11]: part of the Emerald Cup for a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's not just the cannabis
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken all the topsoil off all the
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've toxified it so much that,
boy, it's, you know, you go out in that
[SPEAKER_00]: San Joaquin Valley and they're growing six
legged frogs and all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, we need to be leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to take that responsibility
and raise that bar and show the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: this country how to do it, because they're
not doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not in the vineyard industries and
the traditional agriculture industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty much toxifying the land and
themselves and us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, it's really a great
place for us to be, to be able to lead
[SPEAKER_00]: that way and show everybody how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the state is asking us to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, those people coming back up
here all those years ago, Todd,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were coming back up here not to make
money, but to live a good life with their
[SPEAKER_00]: families, to live organic lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was about growing some cannabis so
they could pay their bills, because nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: was getting rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, back then, if you could bring 100
pounds out, you were a huge guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, anybody could, that was almost
unfathomable because you were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: under the trees in the shade of these
little quarter ounce or quarter pound
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, a huge plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's like people are like,
unless you're a 10 box guy and growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand pounds, a guy showed up at my
house the other day, they were area 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came in and he said, I got four
acres in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting four more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think if I have eight acres,
I can compete?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know what, if every farmer
needs eight acres, we're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doomed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's just no way to support
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way to get enough people to
smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to all have to be
reasonable going into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a big thing because one
of the things I've found in the last month
[SPEAKER_00]: we're finding up here is we have a crisis
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to start a whole like almost a
theater piece on what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're bringing Prop 64 in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're supposed to be reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's supposed to be down at an acre
or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be all playing fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino is playing fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got everybody at the top level doing
a quarter acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we've got 10,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got neighbors complaining because
we're too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet you've got Steve D'Angelo down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 27 and a half acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're predicting 25 million pounds being
grown from Santa Cruz to San Luis Obispo
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's eight times what the triangle
brought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to Eddie and the guys in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come online with 100
million pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're building the greenhouses as fast
as they can right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't impact us this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before Prop 64 came in, you got people
in Humboldt growing four to eight acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got people all over the state that
have gone around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did our senators and our leaders
and everybody allow this nightmare to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen before it even became legal?
[SPEAKER_11]: But don't you think in all factuality,
I mean, there's been a surge of growers,
[SPEAKER_11]: surge of people buying land because it's
got huge profitability.
[SPEAKER_11]: You take the profitability out and you
turn this into tomato farming.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be a whole lot less
enthusiasm around that tomato farming
[SPEAKER_11]: because there's not the profits there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if cannabis goes down to the price of
anywhere near organic tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_11]: under 10 bucks a pound, all these guys are
fucking out the door.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you're going to see a nice quiet
Northern California again because you're
[SPEAKER_11]: going to lose a lot of the people that
came up there with the intent of,
[SPEAKER_11]: can I compete?
[SPEAKER_12]: And not to say that people aren't going to
get a decent dollar for their cannabis in
[SPEAKER_12]: the future, a craft style.
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll always exist.
[SPEAKER_12]: But this $3,000 a pound thing that's based
on people going to prison for years of
[SPEAKER_12]: their life is just no longer the reality
that we want to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Todd, I do disagree with $10 a pound
though.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason is because cannabis is
usually sold dry by the pound.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you sold dried organically grown
tomatoes that were dried, they wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_07]: $10 a pound.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd be more because you have to dry
them and go through the hassle to do so.
[SPEAKER_11]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fantastic example.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll show you, look up my dry organic
tomato pound.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it'll go down to 10,
but you get that there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_11]: situation where your neighbors are looking
at the cost of production and they're
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be realistic about what it costs
to produce that pound of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to double their price
because they have investors that want to
[SPEAKER_11]: see a return.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to turn into a regular
business.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think when that happens,
everything's going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's the trouble is that it already
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what we found out in the
research is that we, I went to sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some serious illnesses over the
winter and I woke up doing this cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: country fair thinking we were going to
have like a total celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost, that's not a wake,
but it's almost like a, total shock and
[SPEAKER_00]: awe thing that's gone on because what we
found is, is that, that last year's
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor right now, because of the millions
of pounds of depots coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost not saleable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're watching people that have,
you know, sour D's and, and, and cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff that they'd be getting 12 to 14,
they're not getting a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're looking at boxes and maybe
they got to go, I've been told seven or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because there's so much demo
coming in that they don't even want last
[SPEAKER_00]: year's anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not even a market for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even back East people don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've got this whole thing where
now you're going to have these millions
[SPEAKER_00]: and millions of pounds of depots coming in
from all over the California farmland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to keep the prices down and
then you're going to have the long season
[SPEAKER_00]: come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got people predicting that you're
going to see long season crops in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mendocino going for six to $700 by
Halloween and probably 500 on the front by
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, I think you're being generous to
be honest with you, Tim, from what I've
[SPEAKER_09]: seen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, really the truth of it is let's be
honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be frank here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can grow a Christmas tree farm and you
sell those Christmas trees less for,
[SPEAKER_07]: for less than a hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them take five years to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think you could do with
cannabis, which is an annual crop?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, of course you could sell it for a
hundred dollars a plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each one, when you drive, you'll get more
than a kilo.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just simple economics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course you can.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Tim, in the nineties,
they were growing so much and down in
[SPEAKER_11]: Switzerland that the way they did harvests
were because they couldn't, they couldn't
[SPEAKER_11]: bring in the labor to harvest everything
in the field.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they had picnic tables set up and
people could come to the fields and
[SPEAKER_11]: literally buy a plant, go cut it down,
process what they wanted, leave the pile
[SPEAKER_11]: with, take what they wanted and split.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's, that's going to be, I believe the
future, because when you get into the
[SPEAKER_11]: labor of taking it down, trimming it,
curing it, and then packaging it,
[SPEAKER_11]: you've tacked on a whole lot of cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Jen Canna people that they
developed a Charlotte's web and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: had a disagreement with the guys that
pushed it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they formed a Jen Canna and went to
Kentucky and worked with Mitch McConnell
[SPEAKER_00]: and Rand Paul to legalize hemp to sell
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew a million pounds last year at
$20 a pound with organic growing farming
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques with the tobacco farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're doing crystal CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd like me to bring it into my
products out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to figure out how I would be
viewed by the people out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started using crystallized CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: from Kentucky, even though they're
California humble triangle people that
[SPEAKER_00]: grew it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, Oh my, what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're coming to California to
do, you know, THC based cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're talking, you know, 50 bucks a
pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional agriculture, when you get in
there, I'm, I'm looking at it like for all
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that spent 40 years in the
triangle, developing this, living this,
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting it, going to jail and,
and trying to put it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have liked to have seen them get
an extra year to, as the transition took
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing is it came in so
quick that it's already here and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to, like you said,
Todd, you're going to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might even go below that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the one side for the patients and
for the amount of products we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get, and for the pricing, it's going to be
an incredible thing across this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: California is going to become a $45
billion industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be remarkable that all
the products and the stuff is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come in here, but it's going to be a very
difficult transition for the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle folks and for the people up in
the Sierra mountains and stuff that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get their brands or old school,
didn't get their permits, didn't do it
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought they'd just stay with it for
the next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to find that it's,
it's coming out of faster than they ever
[SPEAKER_07]: thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think about it, what other
agricultural products are grown up in the
[SPEAKER_07]: Emerald triangle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pears were a big part of Ukiah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truffles, lumber, lumber.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to point out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a true agricultural center the
way many places in California are.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think that, I think that the price
reduction is going to weed out Northern
[SPEAKER_11]: California of all the wannabe cannabis
entrepreneurs and leaf people like that
[SPEAKER_11]: were there because they love the place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause they cared about the place because
it felt like home and they weren't there
[SPEAKER_11]: to make money.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean, and I feel Tim totally for a
lot of the people, there's a lot of 20
[SPEAKER_11]: somethings that were screaming at me cause
I was in support in 64 and I don't really
[SPEAKER_11]: have a ton of pity for them.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were eight, nine, 10 years old when
we passed two 15, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't understand what it was like to
get raided, to get locked up, to go
[SPEAKER_11]: through hell.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they don't get the fight that we
fought for so long.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this hasn't been overnight.
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been fucking decades of us losing
and getting our asses handed to us,
[SPEAKER_11]: our assets taken, our bills lined up,
our lawyers sucking us dry.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, so this hasn't been overnight.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do feel bad for the people that had
gardens in the last 10 years and has just
[SPEAKER_11]: watched profits go down, but this is great
for the end users because there's going to
[SPEAKER_11]: get to a point I think where it goes
direct to consumer where people like you
[SPEAKER_11]: can sell on your website like a winery
does and say, Hey, 3000 cases of XYZ,
[SPEAKER_11]: take it or leave it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe that it's going to change
the face of this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it means that the end user is going
to end up seeing huge price reductions in
[SPEAKER_11]: the cannabis that they get, I think it's
great.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel totally bad for people that
have been living off it, but I feel way
[SPEAKER_11]: better for the people that have been
drinking wine or smoking cigarettes or
[SPEAKER_11]: sucking down pharmaceutical pills because
they had no fucking alternative and
[SPEAKER_11]: couldn't smoke the $400 an ounce shit that
you and I burn like trees.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we burn it like it's nothing,
but a lot of people don't get to live that
[SPEAKER_11]: experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now maybe they will.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, yay.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do think yay for them because it
helped me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope it helps everyone else.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'd love to see you with 10
bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with you, Todd.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see the price for a large
plant that can yield one kilo cleaned and
[SPEAKER_07]: dried, but from a Christmas tree type
setup, $100.
[SPEAKER_07]: That way people could afford to smoke
hashish, you know, and that's what I like,
[SPEAKER_07]: dry stiffed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck Christmas trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: They shouldn't be cutting down pine trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those should all be weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it should all be cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just think of the beautiful smell on
Christmas morning in your house.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you came down and there was just this
big, huge, beautiful cannabis plant in
[SPEAKER_12]: full bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you, Todd, on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do agree that I've been
telling people for years that they had to
[SPEAKER_00]: wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've spent the last three years
getting my manufacturing in place,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting my branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told everybody it wasn't going to go
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all said one more year, one more
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I am perplexed by was that
we talked about with 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I sold people, Todd, was that
this was going to be an orderly rollout.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to hold back large scale
farming to like one acre for just a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just going to let this slowly
roll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's happened so quick that it just
steamrolled it and it's basically over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're seeing up here is going
to be shock and awe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it's like we're coming to the
cannabis country fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for us to have bending so we can
show people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, though,
I fall on your side, Todd, and everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an incredible boon for
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to see cost effective
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 80s, when they started bringing in
so much tie, I wasn't sure what I'd do
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the tie in Mexico because I was
getting thousands of pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just got cheaper and cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, people just started smoking more and
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became like all of a sudden it just
went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what's going to happen with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is going to go from 7% to 20% to
40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon half this country is going to
be using cannabis in some form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be cheap and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, I completely am with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have believed everything that I've been
saying with Jack Herrer for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that society will be a better
place if they have cannabis instead of
[SPEAKER_11]: pharmaceuticals, booze, tobacco,
and everything else.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really believe in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that I believe that the price is
an absolute huge hurdle for a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: people to overcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's beautiful to hear that,
in a sense, low quality cannabis is not
[SPEAKER_11]: desirable because everybody's like,
oh, it's a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a race to mids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now mids won't be able to be sold
because everybody wants good stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're going to have to learn how to
grow quality at a competitive price.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's going to have to be clean because
now we have people like Alex at SC that's
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be able to see if it's not and
disqualify the people that are trying to
[SPEAKER_11]: hustle us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I was blown away that so many
people brought tainted samples and entered
[SPEAKER_11]: them into the Emerald Cup because I
thought, jeez, who would do that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Who wants to get caught?
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's so many people did that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's this willful ignorance of
what they're doing that leads them down
[SPEAKER_11]: this path of thinking they can compete
with stuff that you would never smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that they went to a few
other labs that weren't quite as tough as
[SPEAKER_00]: SC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not have tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did make some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we had an educational
process with the Cup the last two years
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody realizing that because
nothing was getting tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's face it, the thing of it is,
is that most of the OG in these
[SPEAKER_00]: collectives is not tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all indoor and the dispensaries are
turning their head the other way because
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next year, like Alex says,
with the restrictive nature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, it's going to be nine times
harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the stuff is going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one niche for the high end cannabis
farmers is going to be growing a really
[SPEAKER_00]: quality organic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're the best of the best,
you'll have a small niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing, Todd, is that with all
the depots coming in so quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no time to store last year's crop
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these people that store it and think
they're going to keep it nice and tight
[SPEAKER_00]: and sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at this sour D and this
cookies and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great, but it's not fresh light
depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people are looking at it like I can
buy fresh light depot or I can buy your
[SPEAKER_00]: backpack last year's, which are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they're B grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, my God, in one year,
you can no longer can sell last year's
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you do, you're going to sell it for
seven hundred.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting, too, though,
because people are now experiencing fresh
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis in abundance and they get the
terpene profiles and how bright they are.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now they look at stuff that's been
sitting around.
[SPEAKER_11]: They go, I still like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's just there's just not the
shine there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's people are getting wiser to this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is also why when I saw the
breaking down into the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought this is really fantastic because
it's really bringing more attention to the
[SPEAKER_11]: nuances that have been attracting us for
so long.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a great educational tool because
you can't really understand the contest
[SPEAKER_11]: unless you start learning the names of
terpenes and why they're the ones in the
[SPEAKER_11]: heads of the contest.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thought it was a fantastic
educational tool.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really why I've loved Emerald Cup
for so long, because I think that bringing
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone together, you influence the
community because everyone else sees what
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone's doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's an emulation that occurs.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, everyone wants to step up their
game.
[SPEAKER_11]: And do better.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anyone wants to bring dirty
medicine to the table.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you're doing is creating the
element or the atmosphere where they can
[SPEAKER_11]: truly learn and grow and communicate with
one another.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's probably my favorite element of
both of your events.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Tim, besides doing analysis of the
herb and the extract made from it to show
[SPEAKER_07]: any differences in terpene or cannabinoid
contents or ratios, you could also do
[SPEAKER_07]: fresh herb and dried herb because drying
gets rid of three quarters of the terpenes
[SPEAKER_07]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good input.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your input.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make you a consultant.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be interesting to see what happens
next year, because on the website,
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how you're talking about how you're
doing things this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you're going to apply them what
you've learned to the next year's
[SPEAKER_11]: competition.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is also something that this
has been such a growing experience for
[SPEAKER_11]: everybody that's watching you do this,
because it's an application of ideas and
[SPEAKER_11]: technology all coming together under one
roof.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what was the Emerald Cup when I say
technology be in the testing and an
[SPEAKER_11]: application of ideas being organic and
sustainable farming?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's the only way to go.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if someone's not there to teach these
new young bucks, so to speak, how to do it
[SPEAKER_11]: right, where are they going to learn it?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the only conscious way to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: But people buy Budweiser beer,
too, instead of a handcrafted small beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, it's not the only way to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's the intelligent, conscious way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the fastest growing market
in the spirits and alcohol markets is the
[SPEAKER_00]: high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be the fastest in the
cannabis industry, because once people
[SPEAKER_00]: could go to a collective and get an OG and
not have to be Snoop Dogg, they all want
[SPEAKER_00]: an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now that they can go get Skittles or
a six-star full melt concentrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can see the difference between fresh,
frozen, raw, and rather than low grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're going to see those prices
come way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to be able to use much
better medicine, because it'll be much
[SPEAKER_00]: more cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this contest, Todd, I really am proud
of the fact that with the stuff that you
[SPEAKER_00]: say, we can take this around the country,
open source, and teach all these people so
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't do what we did to the triangle
environmentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They learn the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They learn how they're going to get a
better profile with organic farming
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques and how they can get patients
the right medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can teach this whole country and
this whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we need to do is just open it up
to export all this so that we can keep
[SPEAKER_00]: growing enough to sell it all over the
world, which is what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do with the rest of
California agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell it all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's going to be our saving grace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they would just get back and
beyond the interstate, let us go
[SPEAKER_00]: nationwide like they're letting the Gen
Can of folks do with the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sold a million pounds nationwide or
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do 2 million pounds this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can basically hold our
heritage.
[SPEAKER_11]: In some ways, I think the opportunity is
in front of you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And with no disrespect to high times,
they've brought many of us together.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't know a lot of my friends if it
wasn't for the events in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that it's a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the community really could use the
kind of vibe that you guys are putting out
[SPEAKER_11]: because, I mean, again, no disrespect to
high times, but it's it's more of a party
[SPEAKER_11]: vibe and not exactly an environmentally
conscious.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's, you know, save the world vibe.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you and Emerald Cup has definitely
been from more of a coming from the Earth
[SPEAKER_11]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, hey, let's be responsible and,
hey, let's be good stewards and good
[SPEAKER_11]: neighbors.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's the message more and
more people need to learn as they get into
[SPEAKER_11]: this community, because if they don't,
if that if the community doesn't take on
[SPEAKER_11]: these core values, it's just going to be a
shit show.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, that's we don't we don't
need to see more events, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: holding their events and leaving piles of
trash.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the you know, the photos go viral and
everybody thinks, you know, oh,
[SPEAKER_11]: look at those jerks.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we need people like you guys
that stay until the place is perfectly
[SPEAKER_11]: clean and, you know, leave it better than
you found it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really would love to see you go
national with this, if not international
[SPEAKER_11]: with this, because, you know, from the
rumors I've heard, people smoke this stuff
[SPEAKER_11]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the potential is pretty huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we want to do we want to
take exactly what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This conversations and take that across
this country so that people can very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly not have to take 10 years to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get them up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a critical, important
thing for us right now, because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see this country in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not I mean, it used to be a group in
a neighborhood and everybody in that
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood was part of your hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all the hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was across that way with the whole
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now look at what we become in the
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately, a lot of dog eat dog
is starting to happen because people are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to be worried about their their
brands, their own livelihoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of everybody being an outlaw
where it's us against them, now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming it's all us against everybody
because we're trying to fight for our
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to really stop that and really
hold together as a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're trying to teach people
how to manufacture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We teach people how to make six four six
star full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't hold back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't hold back on anything that we do,
because it's got to be open source and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got to be a community.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one thing you can see quite
obviously from the analysis the last few
[SPEAKER_07]: years is that varieties that have high
terpene levels are consistently in the
[SPEAKER_07]: winning circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest THC has never won any of our
contests.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have come in several times and told
me they got the highest THC and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell them all, I'll bet you a
hundred bucks you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the balance of the cannabinoids and
the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, I thought that it would only
be OGs and fuels that would win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden you add the green
queen or green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had these different things come in
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, our judges have really
moved towards those terpene profiles and
[SPEAKER_00]: that balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been nice to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very perceptive that you see that
it really is the higher terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of our judges look for.
[SPEAKER_07]: The real truth is that terpenes on an
average used to be one and a half,
[SPEAKER_07]: 2% of the dry weight total.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they're moving up towards 5% and a few
individuals have been created which are
[SPEAKER_07]: 10%.
[SPEAKER_07]: 10% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what do you think the concentrate on
those terpenes would be if you did an
[SPEAKER_12]: extraction?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't done it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did not do this terpene work,
but friends of mine did do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And 5%, several people I know have fibers,
but a few people even have tenors.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, cause it's just interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got a lot of people talking about
the addition of cannabis derived terpenes
[SPEAKER_12]: and maybe there's a going to be a number
where it's too high terpenes being
[SPEAKER_12]: hydrocarbons, but maybe we are all already
seeing for the last maybe decade to two
[SPEAKER_12]: decades that we've been smoking some
fairly high percentages of terpenes in our
[SPEAKER_12]: extractions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the best way is when you have a
contest like Tim's at the Emerald Cup and
[SPEAKER_07]: the winners are consistently those that
are also highest in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a coincidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think we should go back and do some
research because the testing all came in
[SPEAKER_00]: so late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to admit, I haven't even gone back
and looked at that data and we have all
[SPEAKER_00]: the data from all those concentrates and
we'll bring that into the cannabis country
[SPEAKER_00]: fair because I think that's really a great
suggestion too, to really look at these
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles and the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the cartridges you're pushing 15,
BAM's got stuff that came in over 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got really incredible terpene levels
in there, but I don't know how high they
[SPEAKER_00]: go or where the balance would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to start looking at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so much data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We almost have to hire somebody just to
start mining all the data and giving us
[SPEAKER_00]: back some information.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking about herbal terpene levels
of one or two percent, now up to five and
[SPEAKER_07]: a few individuals have been created,
which are 10.
[SPEAKER_07]: Extracts, I don't even know how high those
numbers would go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think they'd be pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what, I'll have that
information by the cannabis country fair
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to put that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some great notes there.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fantastic, Tim.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't thank you enough for coming on
with us this morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's Father's Day and you got stuff
to do, but I'm excited to go to your event
[SPEAKER_11]: and I hope a lot of people attend.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, it's cannabiscountryfair.com.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank you for producing all
these amazing events that I can't come to.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe one day you'll come up to Canada or
Jamaica and put an event on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are all welcome to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come for VIP tickets if you can
make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you can't, but one day we'll get
you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd and I will make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are, like I said, all invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can camp backstage with us and do
whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd, you've been a great support,
a great voice, a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you down in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm up here in the triangle and it's like
we're both representing the same things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the same things and we're seeing
the same things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't imagine what we'll be in five
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many products, how many new
industries, how many things we'll have to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be tough for the farmers in the
transition, but overall, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the world and for all of us,
it's just going to be an amazing new dawn
[SPEAKER_00]: we're coming into and a new world.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_11]: I say it braves the change.
[SPEAKER_11]: My upside of this, Tim, is I've been
growing my own stuff since I was 13.
[SPEAKER_11]: If a 13-year-old kid can grow it in his
closet without his grandma learning him,
[SPEAKER_11]: finding out he's doing it for a whole
year, I didn't get caught for a year,
[SPEAKER_11]: anyone can grow their own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: It may not be worth much anymore to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it, but you're also not going to go to
jail.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not going to lose your shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not going to get your doors kicked
in or your dog shot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So have your gardens.
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, that's going to be a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry a lot of people are going to get
flushed out of the industry, but I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: really glad a lot of people are going to
really get introduced to cannabis on an
[SPEAKER_11]: economical level so that they can use as
much of it as they want.
[SPEAKER_12]: People need to realize that the worth of
cannabis isn't all monetarily.
[SPEAKER_12]: There is an incredible relationship to be
had when you start using this plant,
[SPEAKER_12]: when you start eating the essential
oil-rich seeds and oils, when you start
[SPEAKER_12]: consuming the cannabinoids, whether
through vaporization or smoking.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are relationships that are created
through that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That, to me, has always been the worth of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: People have to realize that the high
prices are really an artifact of
[SPEAKER_07]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: There would be no high prices like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Traveling around the world, I bought kilos
of Simpsonia for $3.50 because it was
[SPEAKER_07]: barely prohibited in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, we didn't come up in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't come up here all those years ago
to make a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up because I refused to stop
smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going to put me in prison,
they could do it, but I was going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the rest of the guys did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you right now that you don't
see the gauntlet in Northern California
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be people pulled over every
day, two or three, as you drove down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cops know they can't get a
conviction, even though it's not even all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way legal yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no more gauntlet runs throughout
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hallelujah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bringing the cannabis down safe
and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to jail like Todd said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to live in a great world.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's nothing but goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like I said, the only thing is I
think it happened very quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in some ways, Todd, we've been talking
about this for 10, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, it's going to be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all been doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go both sides.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel my brothers and sisters growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I totally understand the loss of an
economic opportunity, but at the same
[SPEAKER_11]: time, it's another opportunity that's good
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, cannabis for all, I think,
should be our new motto, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being a leader.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only with just your Emerald Cup,
but also saying you can step it up a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: in doing with your country fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for constantly raising the bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to a great success for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you can join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all got tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to have everybody up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you guys anything we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd, I'll continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you guys, I respect you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck with your future ventures,
Tim.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all your cheerleaders, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all rooting for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks so much for blessing us with your
presence on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_12]: And anytime you want to come back and
share what it is you're up to,
[SPEAKER_12]: of course, you are welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what I'll share?
[SPEAKER_00]: The last going away thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived up here illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My family couldn't come up here because it
was all too dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got 20 different family members,
nieces and nephews that have all moved up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of my three kids are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just picked my grandson up, just
graduated from high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been growing two plants in Georgia
for the last three years, and now he's
[SPEAKER_00]: working on 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got my whole family coming up
because it's safe for them to come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: not worry about going to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all be proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have Father's Day for
the first time with my whole family and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 20 years out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very happy that this has happened
so that we can do these types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited about where we're
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to doing it with all
you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Enjoy your family.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a great Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thanks for coming out, Tim.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Tim.
[SPEAKER_08]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_12]: How amazing is that, hey?
[SPEAKER_12]: You really see the change now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think Omar had a lot to do with
that, Todd, having his family move up in
[SPEAKER_12]: the last six months?
[SPEAKER_12]: Or it's just the last five years?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been an evolution of change,
of culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we were all afraid of putting our
families through what I've went through.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Etienne had to clean up the mess
of what one of the messes of my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hate that burden on the people I
love.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to experience it with the people that
your family, your daughters, your sons,
[SPEAKER_11]: and to have them, people just sometimes
don't understand or remember how frigging
[SPEAKER_11]: ugly it really was for a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to me, it makes me so happy to hear
that now he can, without paranoia,
[SPEAKER_11]: invite the people he loves to the place
that he grows and literally celebrate life
[SPEAKER_11]: instead of having to worry about that,
you know, that the man was coming and
[SPEAKER_11]: they're going to kick down your still and
shoot your dog and ruin your life,
[SPEAKER_11]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not only that, he can attract now
professionals to run that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: look, we all specialize in our own aspects
of what we're very good in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, I know when I don't have
expertise in something, I hire experts who
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he listed off the cadre that he
has running the show, it shows how serious
[SPEAKER_03]: they're taking and that they really want
to take it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what it takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have production companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have people running things
properly that have done this before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it helps greatly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I'm not saying that you can't do it,
but it very much helps when you have all
[SPEAKER_03]: the contacts, as he said, when bands come
to you as opposed to you going to bands,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a whole different dynamic altogether.
[SPEAKER_11]: And let me throw this out, you know,
again, I never wanted to be in a
[SPEAKER_11]: disrespectful way to high times because if
it wasn't for the cannabis cups,
[SPEAKER_11]: we would not have a lot of the cannabis
consciousness we have.
[SPEAKER_11]: So props to Hager, props to high times,
props to staying, keeping up the torch lit
[SPEAKER_11]: and running with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, one of the things that I
think is good is that high times now has
[SPEAKER_11]: new ownership.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have very professional leadership
that's going to come in and be able to
[SPEAKER_11]: execute the cannabis cup in ways that
they've never been able to in the past.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to see a whole new face on
this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they're listening, I just say this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that they take on an environmental
and a social a bend of social
[SPEAKER_11]: responsibility and high ethic and morality
to what they're trying to do, because we
[SPEAKER_11]: need to set a good example.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they don't, who will?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and you'll also see what Tim does
ripple into other events.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we all know that there's how
many events do you guys have up there in
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: John and and bubble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have, you know, competitions as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have so many here in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're spread all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're looking to who's what
standards are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this gives us another standard set
to compare to to say, hey, this
[SPEAKER_03]: competition is doing this not only the
environmentally sound, but they're also
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it by terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's accelerating the conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people layman or forced to get
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are terpenes?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to elevate the entire
conversation to a point of understanding
[SPEAKER_03]: that I think that the fringe are well
aware of us because that's consider us the
[SPEAKER_03]: fringe because we're the less than 10
percent of 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it brings an opening to the rest of
the community so that people go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all these magazines, because
there's like 20 to 40 different magazines
[SPEAKER_03]: here in the United States now that will
cover that information and make people
[SPEAKER_03]: aware that, oh, this is how things are
done at this competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how it's done there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to cause people like high
times to go, hey, maybe this we should.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to force them economically or
through the competition and realizing how
[SPEAKER_03]: natural people go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to the high times event up north
and I've been to the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is no competition in size that
Emerald Cup draws in comparison to high
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, no offense to high time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got married at the high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd was my best man there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met bubble man there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met Sam Skunk man there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's without a doubt they have their
place in history.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, it's taking it and
elevating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's great to see that this freedom
with Alma, this freedom that are given now
[SPEAKER_03]: with 64 that can push the allows this type
of discussion, not only that competition,
[SPEAKER_03]: not only that, that labs are calibrated
and up to this point that we can actually
[SPEAKER_03]: having this conversation right now,
as opposed to hoping that one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we still have a ways to go with with
testing, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: it shows us how far that we've come.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it very much excites me to stand on
this precipice and to look over the
[SPEAKER_11]: horizon to see what's coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a lot of good things are
happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, and, you know, props to
Steve Hager.
[SPEAKER_11]: When the Cannabis Cup first started,
he was bringing in the whole environmental
[SPEAKER_11]: hemp information into cannabis and trying
to expand the consciousness of the culture
[SPEAKER_11]: and talk about a lot more than just,
you know, who had the best weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was trying to bring in spirituality.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was trying to bring environmentalism.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was the guy that put, you know,
Jack Harris book almost in every other
[SPEAKER_11]: issue of high times.
[SPEAKER_07]: He also gave free booth space to nonprofit
groups that were pro-hemp or
[SPEAKER_07]: pro-environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he did, even though he thinks I'm a
CIA agent, I still give him props for what
[SPEAKER_07]: he did.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, dude, I got an email.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a message.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so huge of you, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so huge of you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that he's gone a little off the
wagon these days with some of the
[SPEAKER_11]: accusations he'd made.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for you to say that is great.
[SPEAKER_11]: The things that go against you,
I think, are rudely wrong on every level.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's awesome for you to say that,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: I admire you a little more all the time,
sir.
[SPEAKER_12]: That rumor is still going on.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got hit yesterday from some
Instagram telling that same bullshit
[SPEAKER_12]: story.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Sam's a CIA agent.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, he ratted everyone.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just such bullshit that I get quite
offended when I get like where I come
[SPEAKER_12]: from.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to say that someone has ratted
someone out, you produce a document.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is the only way.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't have that document,
you shut the fuck up and sit down.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's just where I come from.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very, very, very, very dangerous
accusation to make where I come from.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you better have the paper to back it
up.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Super bullshit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, that's my rant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's puff a bowl.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just defending my mentor, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, man, let's puff one for Franco.
[SPEAKER_11]: AT&T shirts make me want to cry.
[SPEAKER_11]: That I will do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, welcome D420K and Johnny B and Mark
Scaldone.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck, we got talking there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't even welcome you guys to the
room.
[SPEAKER_12]: My apologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Father lover day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Father lovers, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: To all you dads out there, this bong ribs
for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Daddy-o.
[SPEAKER_08]: Each of us had a dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's everybody puffing on?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm puffing on this nice Congo haze,
because I love the haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Empress S-Tracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing the first bounce of the Medi
Kush off the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just melts like water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasty.
Tasty.
[SPEAKER_12]: Melts like water, hey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking right, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congo haze sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it tastes good, too, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll hit this Justin Trudeau Kush bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pardon me for my dirty camping nails.
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit of grease there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: For your reminder from our mad camp
yesterday and sitting in the Argo.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was just like, I hope you had a big
time up there.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were asking, where's Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's the Argo?
[SPEAKER_12]: We had an awesome time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I did my wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_12]: For some reason, I had a Wi-Fi or a signal
for my phone that I could get on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not Wi-Fi, but my actual.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I managed to pull it off each day,
so it was kind of hilarious.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of dirt bike riding.
[SPEAKER_12]: Many, many, many hours of dirt bike
riding.
[SPEAKER_12]: I fell off my dirt bike a couple of really
good times.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank God I wear full gear from head to
toe.
[SPEAKER_12]: But man, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Were you up high?
[SPEAKER_12]: Sleeping in the tent was a bit cold.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were at 3,200 feet, so you could see
your breath.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was probably one or two degrees above
zero.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's about 30 degrees Fahrenheit
for the Americans.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you bring the portable?
[SPEAKER_12]: Were you hitting like dabbs?
[SPEAKER_12]: I was hitting this the whole time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just brought this.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love dabbing.
[SPEAKER_07]: 32 is freezing, so 30 would be low
freezing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: So then it would be like 35, 38 maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Under 40 degrees.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should have been making some hash up
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was only a couple degrees Celsius above
zero.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dry sift up there next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So dabbers, since Bubble Man and Johnny
and others here actually dab, what is your
[SPEAKER_03]: preferred cotton tipped user?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's now different manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Q-tips is of course the one
that's out there, but there's now
[SPEAKER_03]: different manufacturers or people that are
promoting these different types.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering what's your favorite
type?
[SPEAKER_07]: Pure cotton and wood or something.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the big wood ones with the pointy
tips, because I was really thinking you
[SPEAKER_12]: had to scrape.
[SPEAKER_12]: But as I learned to do the low,
low, low temp, I learned that at the end
[SPEAKER_12]: of my rip, it's just a puddle.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can just pick it up with any kind of
fucking Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_12]: And especially because I use DC glass
cleaner, I just put a ton of water on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a tiny bit on the Q-tip and it just
swoops right up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care what kind I use.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the more important thing for me is
the DC glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've taken pieces of toilet paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a DC glass cleaner, if they can
microencapsulate it and have it stuck on
[SPEAKER_07]: the thing so it doesn't evaporate.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've taken... I forgot my train of
thought.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had something, but it's all good.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to hit a rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody's going to come up with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's got to be something where it stays
on the actual tip so you can actually just
[SPEAKER_03]: swab it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That probably takes some time.
[SPEAKER_12]: To me, the DC glass cleaner is way more
important than any Q-tip, because I can
[SPEAKER_12]: make a Q-tip out of anything to clean the
DC glass cleaner up.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I can just pour some into my quartz,
it's going to pick everything up and boil
[SPEAKER_12]: it right out of the bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've used it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is impressive when I've actually
applied it to my quartz.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dumbfounding how fast it actually
causes everything to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is non-chlorinated water, caranja oil,
processed coconut extract, processed kelp
[SPEAKER_12]: extract, and processed extract of sugar
cane.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's mostly water.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the way the oil kind of soaps up a
little bit, they've made videos of these
[SPEAKER_12]: greasy, greasy, fully reclaimed burnt
black glass bowls, putting it inside of
[SPEAKER_12]: this liquid boiling, and it just literally
melts the resin off and de-chasenates.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have called it the de-chas.
[SPEAKER_12]: The de-chasenator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the de-chas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can fix all of my bowls, is that what
you're saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, no, no, let me think.
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen, you've chased those out so bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the difference.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not talking about the gray,
destroyed, smoky, cloudy bowl.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm talking if you get a little black on
your bowl and you can be smart enough to
[SPEAKER_12]: not burn it with your torch, because
that's what we all want to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like, let's just burn it off.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to see it anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once you've done that, you're fucking the
quartz pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: From my perspective, it's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not an expert or anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: You become experts on counter-cleaning
quartz bowls, because I got you.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why is because the mineral
components are left behind.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like a salt layer.
[SPEAKER_12]: It does not come off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once it starts building up, it fuses and
makes a mixed oxide with the glass itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: It fuses with it, so it becomes like,
yeah, if you start scraping it,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're actually scraping the glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me just understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've talked about this cleaner
once before, right, Mark?
[SPEAKER_08]: You put this on, but you immediately wipe
it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't leave a residue behind.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the most important thing for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a heightened sense of smell and
taste, to the degree of it being more of a
[SPEAKER_12]: bummer than a good thing, because trust
me, there are plenty of shitty tasting
[SPEAKER_12]: things and tons of bad smelling things.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm that guy, if I'm talking to someone
and they have bad breath, I can't be three
[SPEAKER_12]: to four feet within them, or I'm just
like, dude, please go fucking floss,
[SPEAKER_12]: brush your teeth.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to throw up.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like, if there's anything
weird in anything, I taste it.
[SPEAKER_12]: This has never left a taste in my bowl.
[SPEAKER_12]: It evaporates out completely like water.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't leave any residue at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wipe it up with Q-tips till it's
dry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then, generally, the next time I go to
smoke, I heat my quartz up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even see smoke come off the quartz
when I'm heating it up, unless I've left
[SPEAKER_12]: resin in there and been a little bit
inefficient in my cleaning.
[SPEAKER_08]: You said it acts like a soap, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a soapy kind of action to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you say that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that caranja oil almost.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I were to do this, do you see that?
[SPEAKER_08]: It emulsifies.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not a huge percentage, but I bet you the
caranja oil content is very low,
[SPEAKER_12]: probably under 10%.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, it's mostly water, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Mostly water.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see the color even is very just
off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anyone else use grunge off?
[SPEAKER_12]: I use grunge off.
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, it's reminiscent of grunge off.
[SPEAKER_12]: Before I saw grunge off, I'll never forget
this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was in my friend's coffee shop in
Amsterdam, the Amnesia coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sitting there with the bud tender.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, I've got this new bong cleaner.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, what kind of bong cleaner?
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, it's not from chemicals.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's talking about how it was from an
enzyme or something from a soybean,
[SPEAKER_12]: something they extracted from a soybean.
[SPEAKER_12]: To produce this very organic, you could
drink it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It wouldn't get you sick.
[SPEAKER_12]: It tasted shitty, but you could clean your
bong.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically the next time I saw it and
how I knew it was very much the same thing
[SPEAKER_12]: was because when I touched it,
it was almost impossible to get off your
[SPEAKER_12]: hands.
[SPEAKER_12]: You had to wash your hands for fucking
five minutes to get this shit to come off
[SPEAKER_12]: your hands.
[SPEAKER_12]: Grunge off was different, but identical.
[SPEAKER_12]: Richard took it and created a different
product.
[SPEAKER_12]: He marketed it and bottled it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I supported grunge off for years.
[SPEAKER_12]: I still do.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_12]: My glass, I clean so often with a little
bit of hot water.
[SPEAKER_12]: You give it a shake and dump it out at the
end of the night.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe a shot, tiny little shot of ISO in
there just because it's quick and fast.
[SPEAKER_12]: My biggest deal nowadays is just cleaning
my quartz.
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be interesting to see if grunge
off worked to clean quartz in a similar
[SPEAKER_12]: way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark, I asked a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a dirty rig and you've poured
all your rig water out, now you're ready
[SPEAKER_08]: to put the cleaner in and there's globules
of reclaim that are in there, will this
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff just act to dissolve all those
globules?
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark showed it to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: He boiled water and poured it in his bong
in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: He poured all the thick stuff and then
used a little bit of ISO and cleaned it
[SPEAKER_11]: and it came out great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ever since he did that, I have a hot water
tap at my house that's separate from my
[SPEAKER_11]: faucet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I use the really hot water, rinse it out
and get all what you're speaking of out of
[SPEAKER_11]: there because as soon as the heat hits it,
it loosens up and agitates.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I soak it with grunge off and the
stuff comes off.
[SPEAKER_11]: I soaked this yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pour that down your drain, Todd?
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you pour your liquid reclaim down a
drain?
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't because it could gack up your
pipes after a while.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends on how often you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it finds a cold surface along the
inside of your pipes, it's going to
[SPEAKER_08]: solidify like an arterial plaque inside an
atherosclerosis patient.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should not pour reclaim down the sink.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you mind enlightening these fellows
to a little story?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've broken more glass pipes than any
other human being on the planet Earth who
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't mean to.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've also clogged more pipes cleaning
my bones.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, you're the reason I don't pour
reclaim down my sink.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you do it for several years or even
five or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you live in the same place,
you don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't you have to remove the pipe and it
was just like full of reclaim?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like a fucking kilo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how much it was, but the guy
stuck one of those, what are they called?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like snakes, you know, the pipe snakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says, what the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all black crap.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it wasn't liquid anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had dried and hardened out and it was
like crystalline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can actually speak to this because I've
actually I don't I don't boil my glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have done actually cold soaks where I've
just poured grunge off directly into old
[SPEAKER_03]: pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I did this with a pipe that I had
from the 90s, an old pipe that I have from
[SPEAKER_03]: a glass blower that just had resident.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just soaked it and then I'd pour it back
into a separate container and then rinse
[SPEAKER_03]: it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I take that the grunge off,
if you put it through a coffee filter,
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll actually go back into its container
and you can reuse it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've I've reused the same bottle of grunge
off for months.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually just went and bought a couple
of ones in our front.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have them for six months.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I have mine from years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can if you have just making
people wear if if you actually filter your
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, you can reuse this for years
because it's it's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can soak coal because, again,
I'm fearful of that hot water and glass
[SPEAKER_03]: just myself because I've I've seen and
people do stupid things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Marcus, what's the new glass cleaner
as well that you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, I'm absolutely amazed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody said over here in the chat
that, oh, sponsored by I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, we're not sponsored by everything that
I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that stuff's not cheap, but it's well
worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one reason why you can recycle
it and reuse it is because it is
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, just get some coffee filters
and an actual little spigot there to go
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this stuff is super cheap.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like eight bucks a bottle if you buy
it by the case or 20 bucks on Amazon or
[SPEAKER_12]: something.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not reusable.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't own shares in the company.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not paid by the company, but I do give
bottles of it away.
[SPEAKER_12]: Marcus.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you use poured a bottle of that down my
clogged pipe, do you think it would have
[SPEAKER_07]: worked?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that if we poured boiling water
down your pipe for quite a while and then
[SPEAKER_12]: poured it down, I think it would have been
quite effective.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it would have come out the top of your
sink.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that is how the pipes got clogged
was with Dr. Bronner's.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Bronner's and boiling water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marcus, what is the pH of that stuff?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure that it says the pH on here,
but I could ask Mick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go throw it in a pH meter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pre diluted.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the pH of that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really curious.
[SPEAKER_12]: Leave soaking until glass is clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I haven't even cleaned glass with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just use it on my bangers, but I'll tell
you, I don't want to hit my torch,
[SPEAKER_12]: my banger with a torch if I don't have the
DC glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I don't have Q-tips, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can get something straight, break off a
little piece of paper or toilet paper or
[SPEAKER_12]: paper towel and make a ball.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's like my Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's unimportant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Important is that I have this little bit
of liquid to clean the bowl nicely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Important to me anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another use is a degreaser.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking that it would.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grease is grease, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just to clean out pipes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a real big thing in the winter
time when pipes start getting cold and oil
[SPEAKER_08]: becomes difficult to flow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I mean, anything that can be
used to degrease could have all kinds of
[SPEAKER_08]: industrial applications.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you like me to send you a bottle,
Mark?
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you?
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just send, send me an email with your,
uh, uh, where you want it sent
[SPEAKER_12]: bcbubblemanaticloud.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always used a small amount of ethanol
and it absolutely gets things sparkling
[SPEAKER_07]: clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just love the fact that this is
non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just simple.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, I put it in little,
uh, I usually have it in these little
[SPEAKER_12]: vials.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll fill up like 10 of these and just
roll with them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I give them to people too, because it's a
nice little thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: You get maybe like 10 or 15 cleans out of
it and it does the job.
[SPEAKER_12]: It does the job.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can hear my little guy in the other room
getting all excited.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was away camping for quite a few days,
so we're going to have a nice day today
[SPEAKER_12]: for Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing for Dad's Day dads?
[SPEAKER_03]: I see, uh, three, three dads here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dads, lots of dads.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly, I did absolutely nothing for
Father's Day that was different than any
[SPEAKER_07]: other day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've rented a submarine and my family and
I are going to be checking out the bottom
[SPEAKER_12]: of the ocean near the house sound.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Todd's head.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this motherfucker telling the truth?
[SPEAKER_09]: Todd wishes he had children.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but I think a submarine sounds really
cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't mind Paul Allen's, you know,
recovery vessels with his whole yacht
[SPEAKER_09]: thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That seems like a lot of fun, but I'll
leave the kids to Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, one of the guys I camp with,
he does, he builds sonars for submarines.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably why it was on my mind and
why I made the joke, but this summer for
[SPEAKER_12]: two months, he's going off to New
Brunswick and there's this area of the
[SPEAKER_12]: Atlantic ocean where like from the 13th,
14th century or whatever on there's been
[SPEAKER_12]: thousands of boats sink in this area.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just brutal.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's going on the submarine to go
recover a particular vessel from like the
[SPEAKER_12]: 14th century.
[SPEAKER_07]: How deep is the sub go that he will be as
deep as they go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like he builds, he did sonar for the
British Navy and he's been on military
[SPEAKER_12]: subs with the U S like this guy is he's a
serious sonar genius guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's yet he gets sick on submarines.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_12]: I get seasick quite easily, but imagine
your job was to build sonar systems and
[SPEAKER_12]: test.
[SPEAKER_12]: He has to go down in the subs to test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Jesus.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you wanted to know the pH of that
solution.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was just kind of curious myself too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I ran up to the garage, grab the pH
meter.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sitting at like six one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Doesn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's mostly water.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, it's high.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm hitting 10, three, 10, four.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's very much really, really high.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's emulsifying the oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just question, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's something I can do right quick
for you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just like 10, six, 10, seven.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a really, really high pH guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it immediately emulsifies the
oil is why it just bubbles right off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a magic trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like watching.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to be a chemist when I grow up,
dude, you should, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know a lot about chemistry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_12]: It always kind of surprises me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, this motherfucker should get a
degree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, someday I'll do something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to be the king of mainstream
cannabis when I grow up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh dude, the king of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can be the king of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Arians already the king of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can't be that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I thought they just crowned Pinsky.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pinsky got crowned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, time out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to be able to do chemistry by just
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't have to touch it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just think about it and it does it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did we even have our Franco rip?
[SPEAKER_12]: It seemed like that kind of dissipated.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did we all get together and say,
let's have a rip for Franco, i.e.
[SPEAKER_12]: we all hit it at the same time.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got our bongs together.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got our dabber.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember doing this several times,
but let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should do it at least every one
minute timer for Franco.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whenever you got everybody in the shot,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why don't we let Darren lead us into this
one?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, two, one, bong rip.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every lover.
[SPEAKER_01]: To all you mother loving, father loving
people out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was appropriate.
[SPEAKER_12]: R.I.P.
[SPEAKER_12]: Franco.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think he lived his life the way he
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be able to live your dreams and
manifest them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the ultimate thing to me,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know him personally, Sam?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know him?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us some stories about him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, I don't really know him in
depth, but I met him numerous,
[SPEAKER_07]: numerous times and we talked about many
issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I liked him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas his partner, I don't want to say
anything if I can't say something good
[SPEAKER_07]: about something.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I won't talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of strains did you guys?
[SPEAKER_11]: Darren, everybody loved Franco.
[SPEAKER_11]: Franco's been involved in the European
cannabis scene going back to the 90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that he obviously loved cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He talked to him about Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loved his Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember deep conversations with Franco
every time I saw him at the T.Y.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup or when I was in Amsterdam and
whenever I saw him about the city of
[SPEAKER_02]: Franco, always at the cups or the events
once here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And boy, he just loved to talk about the
plant and the growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and he was just so in depth with it
and what he passion and talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love talking with Franco and he's
definitely an inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know he definitely loved his Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: He talked about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely had seen him bumped into him
in like half a dozen countries,
[SPEAKER_12]: at least from like all over Europe,
even in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the last times I saw him was with
Tony and they were just standing on the
[SPEAKER_12]: side of the road at a jerk chicken shack
at like one thirty or two in the morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we kind of pulled over because my soup
guy was right next door across the street.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I always go to the vegetarian soup guy
and we look across the street and there's
[SPEAKER_12]: like Aryan and dusty and Franco.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty, pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the love of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cannabis brings the same people to the
same places.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you can be in the middle of
nowhere in the north of India.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can be like in a ganja field.
[SPEAKER_12]: Small world.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a small world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a small world getting smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when Franco if you engaged Franco with
a conversation regarding cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: a serious conversation regarding cannabis,
you were immediately a brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were immediately a sister.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just engaged you with just a love and
an appreciation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his his knowledge, institutional
knowledge of cannabis and phenotypes and
[SPEAKER_03]: just smelling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would watch him smell a cannabis and
look at it and in the way that I had
[SPEAKER_03]: learned to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he just his passion was so infectious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his love for cannabis was just
undeniably.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came through in every sentence that he
spoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was very direct about what he
expected and wanted in his cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But his love and appreciation overall for
every person who engaged with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was humbling and beautiful to watch
because his his knowledge was just very
[SPEAKER_03]: few people I know have that type of
knowledge in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did we see Chimera come in here at one
point in time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, I'm missing that pine and lime.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the lime and pine, the lime and
pine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, Chimera brought this nugget over
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: I really you what you did.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I and you've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It sort of showed me a little bit of the
future.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you came over here and you were like,
you had your little bag of herbs.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like a quarter pound or something.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're like, I didn't have any
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thought I'd bring some herb we could
squish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I did have concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just not consumable by you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't I didn't I didn't want to wave
them in your face.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, the bud had this beautiful
smell like it was very unique.
[SPEAKER_12]: It had there was a sweet skunk ask
whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have thought that was like
terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_12]: What what what do you think that is,
Chimera?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably the piney in a combination
with the limonene also.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just the combination of the two make this
most unique.
[SPEAKER_12]: And wow, was the high ever unique,
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: We made some really nice rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wished I had photographed it better
because we would have been able to throw
[SPEAKER_12]: up a picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I like the name instead of lime pie
pie lime.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it was like he had it written like
lime and pine or pine and lime on the bag,
[SPEAKER_12]: as in the two dominant terpenes,
as in he didn't even know the name of the
[SPEAKER_12]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, that's the shit right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The names aren't important, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the chemical profile that's
important.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm starting to rename things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on just based on that, because I
think it gives the most information.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about Tim's new category
for a contest?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already copyrighted all of the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think of the new contest
broken down by five different
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoids, five different terpenes?
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't seen it, actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: I put a little something in the chat.
[SPEAKER_11]: The links in it in our chat right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can click on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't come.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't in then, so I don't see that
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be the future, obviously.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll it'll be right up your alley for
sure.
Kymar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: So are Alex and Tim coming in?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're late.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tim was here, came here doing bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Alex, I don't know what happened to
Alex.
[SPEAKER_12]: He he tends to sleep in.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm guessing he had a really good night
last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some good fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they back up down by.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you cut out there for a second.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your voice is breaking up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go again, Kymar.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, you never tell these guys
they need to do this since, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we started doing the terpene classes
because it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Judge wine, it's the same thing,
right?
Like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The closest similarity is to wine or beer
to a lesser degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's you know, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's it's classified by the dominant
terpene.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's for THC varieties rather than
type two or type three.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to test both the
concentrate and the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the myth and the rumor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's going to be a fantastic.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like that they're changing things.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a fantastic way to change
things based on science and not
[SPEAKER_11]: speculation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've always thought that the that the
classes were stupid, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: especially when mostly everything is is
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's no real true hazes in the
contest anyway that I would even almost
[SPEAKER_11]: remotely almost want to mistake that they
call sativa.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's always been this whack mix of
hybrids that they try to identify as
[SPEAKER_11]: sativa, indica and other.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've always thought it was dumb.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this at least is based on some accurate
like a profile, an unknown terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: profile.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I think varieties that are
similar to each other, a better chance of
[SPEAKER_11]: competing with one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I mean, I mean, when you look at
all the terpene classes, there's more to
[SPEAKER_04]: it than just the dominant terpene,
for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, this is a good start.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to poo poo there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their new method, but it's it's not like,
for example, in pining, like you can have
[SPEAKER_04]: there's multiple different terpene classes
in the pining superclass, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's taking one instrument out of an
entire orchestra and trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_08]: what piece the orchestra is playing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like maybe that is the loudest
note.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's kind of Pandora with music
because that's what they did, a little
[SPEAKER_11]: genome type to music.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is it's like who's the loudest horn
and in a way it but it's a lot better
[SPEAKER_11]: than, you know, the made up names that the
growers were calling it anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it's too simple, it's a start.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a start.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it is a start.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's putting us on the right path,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people have to learn about terpenes
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I'm saying that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if you got a cookies and an OG,
like cookies and OG are relatively close.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would I would say that they're,
you know, they're in the same type,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But typically OG is especially if it's
grown well, it's like limonene dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not usually karyophyllene dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: But cookies, for example, is karyophyllene
dominant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like those are two plants that
smell kind of similar, but they're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to end up in different classes here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's an OG is an OG is a hell of a
lot closer to cookies than, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: say, Berry White.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it kind of does chop them up in a way
that's like we've got to understand the
[SPEAKER_07]: individual notes before we can understand
the sweets.
[SPEAKER_07]: When when when there's a complex
combination of notes, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: that that may be everybody's favorite in
the end, but we have to start someplace.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, again, to make the music analogy,
there's classic music, there's bluegrass
[SPEAKER_08]: music, there's jazz music.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are all different classes that all
get awarded Grammys, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Grammys awarded in all of those
categories.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the categorization that Ryan is
referring to something based on how it
[SPEAKER_08]: actually tastes, maybe there could be more
broader categories on citrus and how the
[SPEAKER_08]: terpene profile expresses the citrus
flavor could be a limonene dominance or it
[SPEAKER_08]: could be a citral dominance.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there could be all kinds of different
other notes that are right underneath the
[SPEAKER_08]: main note and the predominant terpene
there to really give the overall flavor in
[SPEAKER_08]: essence.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why don't we just base it on,
you know, the human paladins?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you do like the terpene sweetest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So imagine you have like, you know,
it's like saying, OK, this is a three
[SPEAKER_04]: piece band with like a keyboard,
a drum and a bass player.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you compare all those different
types of three piece bands that are
[SPEAKER_04]: keyboard, bass and and a drummer and a
percussionist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to have a different sound
than a guy on a guitar.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like a single guy on a guitar or
like a guitar and a bass and a drummer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they're going to have different
sounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's a start.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a start.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good start.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's you know, we're teaching people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a start, but it's also predicated
on very reproducible results.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so do all gorilla glues fit?
[SPEAKER_08]: A karyophylline dominance or just certain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like environmental effects of your grow
can take your scene dominant or they can
[SPEAKER_04]: push the limonene up and then it's
limonene dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, it's still beta karyophylline,
myrcin and limonene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the top three.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ryan, isn't it true that karyophylline
is essentially ubiquitous in all green
[SPEAKER_08]: plants?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you extract about any green
plant on earth, you'll find karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of those ubiquitous terpene
that's just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's really prevalent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not ubiquitous, though, because you
can you can knock out the sexeterpene and
[SPEAKER_04]: have varieties that are just monoterpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're almost only monoterps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's prevalent in most essential oils that
I've looked at, like mint oils.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in cat mint oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's in spearmint and peppermint,
too, as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just assume it's just one of those
compounds that if there are glandular
[SPEAKER_08]: trichomes, it's in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Karyophylline is just like one of those
basic molecules that's expressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's funny, though, because I mean,
when you know when they pursued corn and
[SPEAKER_04]: they went after the sweet corn and they
started braiding for sugar content,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's like like you do with
selections when you select for one thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're unconsciously selecting against
something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out that most modern corn
varieties have actually purged at beta
[SPEAKER_04]: karyophylline, which is which is strange
because beta karyophylline is a is a
[SPEAKER_04]: compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of it's bitter tasting to
bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it's even produced in roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like there's corn variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have these corn varieties that are
the high sugar varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get worked over by, you know,
certain grubs and stuff in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're actually now going back and
breeding beta karyophylline back into the
[SPEAKER_04]: court.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just give me two seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find a paper and I'll post it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know if they're the shrunken or the
SU or the SUE or do you know which version
[SPEAKER_07]: it is that you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get the paper and put it up and then
you can have a look.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okie dokie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew that they were trying to put
protein content.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this was like high lysine corns,
corns that are genetically modified to do
[SPEAKER_08]: all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: But man, it's scary.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have what they call sweet and super
sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the super sweets also have when you
get the corn seed for planting,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's shrunk up like a raisin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yeah, I mean, here in the
Mid-Atlantic, there's something called
[SPEAKER_08]: Jersey white corn and I guess it's maybe
native to New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's small little pearl giblets and
they're just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only basically harvested at this time
of year from now to like maybe,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the end of harvest.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's it's wonderfully sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the best corn on the cob you've ever
had.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just eat it without even cooking
it probably.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cooking it and then slathering butter and
salt over it is what I like.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I put two papers in our chat
and for anybody that's in the viewers
[SPEAKER_04]: chat, it's called Amaze beta-karyophylline
synthase implicated in indirect defense
[SPEAKER_04]: responses against herbivores.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not expressed in most American maize
varieties.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll try to paste that into the chat room
so they can try to find the link.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I can even just paste the link into
this chat room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they can just Google that and we'll
find it will come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But and then just, you know, if people are
looking to want to find the paper to
[SPEAKER_04]: Psyhub.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, they weren't looking at the big
picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were strictly focusing at the small
picture and they were incredibly
[SPEAKER_07]: successful at creating what they did do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember what they were doing was
looking for corn or looking for high sugar
[SPEAKER_04]: content.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know exactly what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were very, very successful.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they were only looking at the picture
right in front of them and not the big
[SPEAKER_07]: picture, which is what you're talking
about with this paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you go for one thing, I mean,
there's tradeoffs, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like you said, they're looking at
that one fine point, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were quite successful at looking
at that one fine point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But down line, they realized that it was
not that simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it had other downstream effects,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you want to talk a little bit about
the effects we got from that pine and
[SPEAKER_12]: lime?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the liming and pining, the reason
that variety is so special is that it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: rare terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: It falls back to kind of the hippie weed
of the 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like and it was really it's
like I said, it was just up and focused,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing is for sure, they are both
potentiators and moderators.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's got that bronchial dilation
effect, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It basically opens up your airways and
lets all the other wonderful things from
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And liming speeds up your heart rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that kind of gives you that
get up and go feeling, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it was definitely nice to dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: We dabbed it out of existence.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be interesting to see the
difference between one that was slightly
[SPEAKER_07]: limaline dominant or pining dominant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marcus, what was the consistency of the
rosin?
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it tacky or sticky or what was it
like?
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it scattered?
[SPEAKER_12]: It was quite, you know, pull and snap kind
of sticky, but it looked like very,
[SPEAKER_12]: very like.
[SPEAKER_08]: What temperature and pressure is your?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I might even got one picture on my
phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really light colored.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marcus, can you tell us what temperature
and pressure you're pressing at?
[SPEAKER_12]: We pressed at 80 PSI and the temperature.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the temperature?
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was about like 190 to 200.
[SPEAKER_08]: 190 to 200.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it glassy or buttery?
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of in the middle of both of
them.
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't butter in the sense that you
could pull it and it would like stretch,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it had the color of something that
like looked buttery.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I asked because the color does
look.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a, we did two squishes with this
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, all I can say is isn't life
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was really impressed with that
Sasquatch machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the, the, the lemon pine,
it's such a low yielding variety that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, making an extracts by putting it
in the column is not really an efficient
[SPEAKER_04]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sure you'd make it, but you
wouldn't get very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you being able to have that
Sasquatch and just put in like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a couple of grams or whatever it
was.
[SPEAKER_04]: The squeeze it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, I mean, that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Ryan, why, why is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that, is that variety just,
that is a low oil producer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that just a, no, the amount of biomass
that you get off of a light, it's not,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, it's hard to say, Oh,
those three, like that 3000 Watts of
[SPEAKER_04]: electricity in like 12 weeks or 10 weeks
or whatever we were growing it for the
[SPEAKER_04]: yield, such a slow amount of flowers that
to like just take it all and load it into
[SPEAKER_04]: a column is an economically really
economically viable, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been really been consuming it as
flowers, but you know, like we took it and
[SPEAKER_04]: put it in the Sasquatch press and it,
it coughed out some beautiful,
[SPEAKER_04]: it really was the essence of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was, it was a really,
really nice set of dapps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that a fresh squash or a dried bud
squash?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cured.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cured bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It had a nice moisture content in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't like powdery snappy,
but at the same time, it certainly wasn't
[SPEAKER_12]: wet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just cured.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was well cured bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that stuff is about six or eight
weeks from harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been in a bucket, but it's,
it's, you know, it maintained its proper
[SPEAKER_04]: eight to 10% water content.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a great little machine for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure they're going to make a smaller
one so that people can, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: feel, feel a little more like it might be
a little bit much having this giant thing
[SPEAKER_12]: on at your house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a kick out of watching you squash it
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it wasn't, you weren't just,
you weren't just using your eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're using your ears and your nose to
like, you know, you're kind of like the
[SPEAKER_04]: resin whisperer.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, just a second, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm listening.
[SPEAKER_14]: Quiet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the herb talking to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, I mean, really, I, I'll come back
and squish more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's like, that's the way to consume
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those dads were so tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they were just so tasty.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even the way it smells like fresh on,
you know, you can just be like,
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of those terpenes there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just, uh, very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Ryan, your opinion that that's
something that can be done, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: commercially the squishing, you know,
to make rosin as a concentrate product in
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a very, it has to, to bulk it up
to a process where you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw someone posted a 300 gram,
uh, shatter pad padding that they had
[SPEAKER_04]: done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's the type of process that you
need.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to be producing at 300 grams at a
time, like producing a gram at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't going to cut it in a legalization
world, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's more of a home user type type
of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even 3000, you know, like 30,000 grams,
like who knows how it's crazy to think
[SPEAKER_12]: that, well, I guess there is enough
cannabis being grown in the sense,
[SPEAKER_12]: but just not by licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_12]: But like licensed producers, if they all
got together now could not, they would not
[SPEAKER_12]: have enough cannabis for even like a
fraction of the people that want to use it
[SPEAKER_12]: right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's kind of laughable that there's
even this up, this option of a monopoly
[SPEAKER_12]: like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they can't even supply.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a monopoly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, are you talking about supplying
herbally or times that much so that they
[SPEAKER_07]: can make something like this?
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like concentrates myself.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that the main reason why
dispensaries have a strong, uh,
[SPEAKER_12]: position is that they're still offering
concentrates to people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, and the LPs are unable to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The government really needs to deal with
that issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the whole thing is when they're
creating this legal market, they need,
[SPEAKER_04]: they need Canadians to buy in,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to them accept that that is
going to be the new, the new source for
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you keep, you know, if you say it's
like they did with the dried, with the
[SPEAKER_04]: dried cannabis at first, I said,
no, you can only consume dry cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have oils, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't have the extracts available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course the black market is going to
still persist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know guys that are like MMA,
our growers, and they produce for
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries and stuff, but they moved a
hundred percent to, um, production for
[SPEAKER_04]: extracts, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they do is they grow
greenhouses and they, and let's not forget
[SPEAKER_12]: this though.
[SPEAKER_12]: One major thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: The LPs would have been doing a lot better
had they not maintained the exact same
[SPEAKER_12]: prohibition based prices for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: This again, it's, it's typically LPs are
owned by people that are from outside the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like it takes $10 million to get a
license, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not your average stoner or
grower that can come in and compete in
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't play in that pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it ends up being a bunch of money guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with money guys, the first thing is
how do they get their money back?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the same prohibition based prices.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I think the black market,
uh, would have been more drastically
[SPEAKER_12]: affected just like anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: If all of a sudden people can buy
something it's good quality and it's not
[SPEAKER_12]: expensive, like make it inexpensive and go
for the long game.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's flip the script.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how much would five star go for in
the new model?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like five star should command the highest
price, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: But that price will be dependent upon how
much material we can get to grow that kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of material, you know, to process into
that product.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what was the cost on doing it?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's never as much as I've been based on
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but when our prohibition is gone,
then the price will be supply and demand
[SPEAKER_07]: and what the real price to produce cost.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not, there's a little bit of a gap
there in the actual production cost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I mean, they're making it seem like,
well, the production costs are high
[SPEAKER_12]: because, you know, some of them are
putting 30, $40 million into their
[SPEAKER_12]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, that is a high production cost,
but in the long run, it's like a toll
[SPEAKER_12]: bridge.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't need to charge you a hundred
dollars each time because the consistency
[SPEAKER_12]: and the growth and the sheer volume that
will move through that bridge will pay it
[SPEAKER_12]: off like tenfold in like, you know,
20 years or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about the lime and pine again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So say, say they're growing like BC
grapefruit, for example, they're producing
[SPEAKER_04]: two ounces of square foot or like,
you know, they're, they're doing a gram
[SPEAKER_04]: per watt, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the lime and pine is going to
produce like 200 grams per, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: per thousand block light.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to produce a kilo.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's five to therefore the
footprint is five times more expensive
[SPEAKER_04]: than if you're growing a high yielding
variety.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of like four marks of G,
it will be 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, but you're not thinking about the
rest of the world getting involved in that
[SPEAKER_12]: same cultivar being grown in Jamaica or
Brazil or India, and being able to express
[SPEAKER_12]: that terpene expression even better under
the sun, under a huge, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: on an acreage.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now we're getting into, you know,
the supply and demand and agricultural
[SPEAKER_12]: product and the price is not going to be
as high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's theoretically possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: The regulator don't really, they don't
really go for that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have to, once the, once America goes
federal, all the other countries are just
[SPEAKER_12]: like, they're so confused by the state
thing that's happening and money that's
[SPEAKER_12]: being made and Colorado made 200 million.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it's just like constant, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: All over the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_12]: People from governments are seeing this
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: The future of cannabis and extractions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, look at how many countries can you
buy wine from?
[SPEAKER_07]: How many countries can you buy distilled
spirits from?
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: International trade item.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what I think you can't go
from state to state, but that's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: change really fast.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I think you're right, Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that certain places will
uncover certain cultivars that express
[SPEAKER_12]: almost, you know, the highest expression,
the one of the, and then I don't know how
[SPEAKER_12]: to really word it properly, but yeah,
you know, the way I bring it up all the
[SPEAKER_12]: time, French is the France is known for
some of the best lavender because for
[SPEAKER_12]: whatever reason in that region,
all the variables, environmental,
[SPEAKER_12]: everything adds up to a beautiful
expression of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same with wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's why Australia is known for
Shiraz or Sarah grapes, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow really well in that area.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make a really nice product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's obvious cannabis will be that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both grown outdoors in perfect conditions
that allow it to finish fully.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also in greenhouses with or without
supplemental lights and darkening and
[SPEAKER_07]: indoors under lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that is required for some reason,
whether it be legal problems or weather or
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe medical requirements.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we saw it happen when,
you know, right now, again, and remember
[SPEAKER_04]: it is all growers and they're expecting
these high prices, but remember what
[SPEAKER_04]: happened when Scott or Shanti Baba and all
those folks were growing down in
[SPEAKER_04]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they went to the tomato growers and
they said, Hey, you know, if you get a
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, we're going to give you the clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you get the plants to knee high,
they'll be worth this much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they get to waist high,
they'll be worth this much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, to the tomato growers,
they were making like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a dollar or $2 or whatever it was per
square foot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you, when you offered them five,
they were stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the growers were so thrilled to
grow cannabis rather than tomatoes because
[SPEAKER_04]: they made five times as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the reality is that to a dope grower,
I mean, they were the guys that were
[SPEAKER_04]: buying it from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was worth like $20 a square foot or $30
a square foot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you get the growers from other
industries involved, they're, they're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to, that's when the costs are really
going to drop, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they don't have the expectations
of a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the expectation of someone
that's producing, they're getting by just
[SPEAKER_04]: producing like just a couple of dollars
per square foot.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will say that I've seen, well,
sorry, Sam, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Netherlands, the margin used to be
25 cents or what could make or break would
[SPEAKER_07]: be 50 cents a square meter.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was in the straight flower and
vegetable market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when, you know, when the law has
changed enough that all those guys can
[SPEAKER_04]: actually get into the game without having
to go through these insane restrictions to
[SPEAKER_04]: become a licensed producer, you know,
that's when we're going to really see the
[SPEAKER_04]: cheap cannabis coming up because it will
shift from those few people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: growing cannabis now to like Todd's been
saying for so long, it will be an
[SPEAKER_04]: agricultural crop where prices are going
to crash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Ryan, did you see this PCR tool that
Kevin's company released for Russet mites?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm putting the link up right now,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you can put that link in
the, in the YouTube chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it was a powdery mildew and Russet
mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, PCR is actually, actually you
know, unique DNA sequences, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So every, every species has unique DNA
sequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can identify those unique
sequences, then you can use them as a
[SPEAKER_04]: probe to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, I don't, again, I don't,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to say, yeah, it's another
little tool in the toolbox, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was only useful because it only,
like I said, it only detects that one
[SPEAKER_04]: unique sequence to, or that they've
identified in Russet mites.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it might be useful for both broad
mites, Russet mites and using it on little
[SPEAKER_07]: tiny clones that you were taking.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were going to grow them to be a big
mother, it might be nice to know that they
[SPEAKER_07]: were free of these problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it can't be used to diagnose it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can only be used once the infection is
taking place or could it, could it look at
[SPEAKER_07]: the, I think Kevin told me that it was
effective on a single spider mite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the beauty thing about how
PCR works is, is that's what they use in
[SPEAKER_04]: crime, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: To identify blood samples, because you can
take a tiny, tiny little piece of DNA and
[SPEAKER_04]: you amplify it in the process and you can
say, oh, wow, there's this, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: in that little tiny piece of DNA,
we found this sequence, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the reason I think it's useful for,
for Russet mites or for sicklemen mites or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever they are, is that they're so
small, they're hard to identify.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't see them really.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, without some handheld device,
I can't see them.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you see the damage, but you don't see
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, that'll help them, you know,
it'll help people identify.
[SPEAKER_08]: But like if you have an infection in one
part of the plant that's isolated from the
[SPEAKER_08]: rest of the mass of the plant and you
sample from the rest of the mass,
[SPEAKER_08]: will you also come up with a positive hit,
even though where you sampled from isn't
[SPEAKER_08]: necessarily infected?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but you have to have the DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of the creature.
[SPEAKER_08]: The DNA doesn't move into the plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's nothing systemic about
infection in the plant that now creates
[SPEAKER_08]: some kind of biomolecule that can be
traced.
[SPEAKER_07]: There might be a virus transmitted,
but that's not part of the mite directly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a virus, but mites do spread viruses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is how they test for E.
[SPEAKER_08]: coli in the food supply.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's a very, very sensitive
methodology.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just wondering, is it really,
and I don't have any other person that I
[SPEAKER_08]: think is more qualified than Ryan to
understand, you know, whether or not this
[SPEAKER_08]: is like overkill or is this something
that's going to be in every lab?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like everyone's going to have one of these
things because this is just going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: like the bee's knees when it comes to how
to determine whether or not you're weak.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never had russet mites.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying you can't, but I've been
growing for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never had russet mites.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never had broad mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the question as to whether it's
overkill is it's really like, do you have
[SPEAKER_07]: the problem?
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it's not overkill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, for example, like you don't
need it to identify the two spotted spider
[SPEAKER_04]: mite because the damage is apparent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's pretty clear when you see
that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you've got mice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need to go and get a PCR test to
say if you actually get webs and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: really styling, you can really tell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, like I said, the cyclamen
mites are so small.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the leaf, it's one of those things
where it's like growers are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's something wrong with my plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the sample symptom.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's hard because the mites are so,
so tiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't see them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to identify that this is the
pest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for that type of thing, sure,
it would be a really, it would be a cool
[SPEAKER_04]: way to say, no, no, you've got russet
mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to do this.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's quite handy with new material
that you were going to bring in from
[SPEAKER_07]: outside of a, in other words, if your
greenhouse is quarantined and you're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to bring fresh material in to be able to
test it with something like this might be
[SPEAKER_07]: something handy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing, the way I feel about it is this
is they've got, you've got, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's, there's sample prep and there's
collecting and all that stuff takes time
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're, when you're, when you're
doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but so to get back like one piece of
information, like mites present,
[SPEAKER_04]: yes or no, or why chromosome present,
yes or no.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, who cares when it's like one at
a time you're getting these traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you can get them all together
in a gene panel or on a gene chip and then
[SPEAKER_04]: you submit, you know, then you submit that
to the lab and you get back information on
[SPEAKER_04]: a hundred markers or a thousand different
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the pathogens, all the ones that are
bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so you can, you can do this as I
understand, not on just live plants,
[SPEAKER_08]: but on, on harvested material and cured
material as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's DNA based, it doesn't,
as long as you haven't, yeah, as long as
[SPEAKER_04]: the DNA is present, you can do these
tests, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically you can, you can do that test
up to the processing of the material,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I'm sure after, um, it's,
it's processed into a concentrate or
[SPEAKER_08]: extract.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was mite infested extract also have
the DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, most likely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, definitely, especially if it's
coming from stuff like there's no chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for example, if you were squishing,
right, there's going to be DNA in the
[SPEAKER_04]: squish too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, these are all experiments that
need to be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, where's it's such a new
science.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to copyright the name mighty
resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you're going to have
people lining up to buy them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, no, it's, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's like I said, it'll be,
it'll be, we're working.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think these single tests are like,
I kind of, you know, I kind of roll my
[SPEAKER_04]: eyes out a little bit because it's like
having information on one marker is not
[SPEAKER_04]: that exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what is exciting is that we're on the
path to, you know, Kevin slowly building
[SPEAKER_04]: his army of his, his, he's expanding the
toolbox.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now he's got a cool tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: The toolbox with a couple of tools in it,
but one day it'll be full with tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when it'll be really useful to
growers and breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, I, you know, as much as I
don't get all excited about, okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: yay, we got a marker for Mike tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it doesn't, that doesn't really
excite me, but what excites me is that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're on the path.
[SPEAKER_12]: It also is getting the conversation going,
I guess, in a sense with some people that
[SPEAKER_08]: might not otherwise be having it and
having people who are have that expertise.
[SPEAKER_08]: To be able to have wherewithal to be able
to bring those products to fruition.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we really need is instead of a mildew
test is a mildew susceptibility test.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where we can test the genome before it was
very tall and you would determine,
[SPEAKER_07]: no, this should not be saved because it's
incredibly susceptible to mildew.
[SPEAKER_12]: So like most of the cultivars on the West
coast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to ask you, Kamir,
I just was looking at some of the approved
[SPEAKER_11]: products in California and there was one
called regalia that is a natural organic
[SPEAKER_11]: fungicide.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I put a link to it in the chat that we
have.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was just wondering if you had any
information on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's, I think regalia is a
bacteria, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like one of those ones that colonizes
the leaf surface and makes it more
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult for the spores to, you know,
like I said, they colonize the leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of occupy the real estate on the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the spore lands, germinates,
it's harder for it to control.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you use that kind of a control when
they test your cannabis for purity and
[SPEAKER_07]: cleanliness, will that set the test off?
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends on the type of test that they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they're doing- It might make it
flunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if they're doing like,
for example, like Kevin McCurden's test,
[SPEAKER_04]: if they're using a DNA, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're probing it for DNA, you can find
these like really minute, minute amounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they're doing a DNA-based test- The
dead spores of the mildew, which didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: germinate, but instead landed on this
other thing you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just for your information,
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam, it's an extract from the plant,
a giant knotweed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I understand exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm saying if you sprayed your plant
with it, then a spore from mildew landed
[SPEAKER_07]: on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might die rather than germinate on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you then took a DNA sample of that
leaf, you would still get the spore from
[SPEAKER_07]: the mildew.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would maybe test positive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or can it tell the difference between dead
and alive?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, if it was DNA, it's just, is DNA
present or not?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, doesn't that make the DNA test kind
of flawed?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, dust, you know,
is organic and is present in our
[SPEAKER_11]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if, you know, certain particles landed
on it, you're just screwed.
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be post-processing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything you did was right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You grow these perfect organic
strawberries and, you know, XYZ lands on
[SPEAKER_11]: it, and then you flunk the test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they could do what are called
calibration curves, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you test a sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: We said this a long time ago, but if it's
powdery mildew or powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_04]: contamination, you can detect between low,
medium and high levels of contamination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but again, they got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got to do those calibration curves
like cannabis show.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have low, high and medium
levels of contamination and then be able
[SPEAKER_04]: to say, this is the chemical or the DNA
signal that's coming off that.
So,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you, you know, if you look on that
little graph that they posted up on the,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you, if you scroll down the first graph
on the graph on the left, you can see
[SPEAKER_04]: they've compared it to things like
actinivate, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So actinivate is a, it's again,
it's a biocontrol, but it's a bacteria
[SPEAKER_04]: that they spread on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, what all I'm saying is that
DNA signal is going to be in the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or on the, on the flower, right on the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wondering what will happen with
those DNA signals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Will they pass or not pass when it comes
to looking for fungus and bacteria and
[SPEAKER_07]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it'll set it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and that's, you know, why it's so
important to choose the test to,
[SPEAKER_04]: because we're not trying to detect who
cares if there's like, the fact that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can find mite DNA on your flower doesn't
mean that it's contaminated, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, you're amplifying these
tiny, tiny, tiny levels of DNA,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: This stuff, for instance, they're saying
that you can spray at the day of harvest
[SPEAKER_11]: on strawberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they, well, they wash strawberries,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't wash cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different type of plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because it's so oily, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubble man washes cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: You would be worried about losing that
resin though.
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember it happened when people were
doing the sulfur too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the resin glands.
[SPEAKER_04]: People would say when they're burning the
herb, but they couldn't tell that it had
[SPEAKER_04]: sulfur.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people couldn't tell, but when you
extracted it down, it tasted like fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: burning matches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was just on a flavor thing,
but imagine it was a compound that didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have flavor, but it had toxicity,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you couldn't taste it, but the resident
plans are sucking up those, those
[SPEAKER_04]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, it's, it's, it's all I'm
saying is that it's not the same thing as,
[SPEAKER_04]: as strawberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same saying it's safe to
spray on strawberries because you can wash
[SPEAKER_04]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the same thing that cannabis
doesn't mean that it's safe to spray on
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis up till a couple of days before
harvest or even later.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got like four weeks or five weeks
because we used to use a BT bacteria,
[SPEAKER_07]: thuringianus a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we tried to use it right up until the
plants were about to start flowering,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, try to stick the use all
vegetative.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also it is, is a, is a, a organism,
a bioorganism.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's nothing dangerous, but
[SPEAKER_07]: people using chemicals during flowering,
it's just, I can't even think of what to
[SPEAKER_07]: call them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let me say this too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I totally subscribed to what Ryan's
saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you start seeing flowers form on your
plants, like even week three, I don't
[SPEAKER_11]: recommend you spent, you, you sprayed that
anything on those damn things.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's probably responsible to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, even no matter how safe it is like,
Oh, it's a safe biologic.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, okay, but it's safe to like
burn and inhale into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause that, have they done that research?
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause that's generally what's happening
with our cannabis and our resin.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's going to change.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go through some of the chemistry and
just how much change goes on.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're smoking leaves, you have to be
careful about what any, anything that gets
[SPEAKER_07]: on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're smoking flowers, then what's on
the leaves probably won't have any effect
[SPEAKER_07]: on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're only smoking resin, then yeah,
but it also depends.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're using a biological, it,
you know, these things are not
[SPEAKER_07]: intrinsically going to harm the resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas some of the chemical sprays I'm
positive that they do poison the resin
[SPEAKER_07]: itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the, the U S EPA regulates these as
so-called bio pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're viewed as being sort of more
environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think even neem oil falls into that.
[SPEAKER_08]: My cat mint insect repellent falls into
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're, they're biologically sourced.
[SPEAKER_08]: And think of it as what you're doing is
you're augmenting the local biome of the
[SPEAKER_08]: plant by just changing the, the natural
biology that's already happening by giving
[SPEAKER_08]: it a new little biochemical, which is
really a biologically derived system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're just augmenting the biology.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a spray chemical, but you know,
those chemicals again, or those,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, enzymes, those extracts,
those types of pre-preparations are
[SPEAKER_08]: usually not as effective and not quite
systemic as the, as the chemicals are.
[SPEAKER_08]: But remember that the, uh, onus is on the
company who registers those things with
[SPEAKER_08]: the EPA to get the EPA registration for
those end use products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so in order for you to show the
efficacy and the safety of those products,
[SPEAKER_08]: you have to conduct trials with humans,
which take institutional review board,
[SPEAKER_08]: okays, and many millions of dollars to
actually get approved and actually do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, um, Scott's miracle grow claimed
this week in the news to actually start
[SPEAKER_08]: that process with the EPA on one
particular thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're registering something.
[SPEAKER_08]: For specific use on cannabis, which tells
me that they've done efficacy and they've
[SPEAKER_08]: done some type of probably bridging to
human safety studies because there's been
[SPEAKER_08]: so much work done in agrochemicals to
assess their safety.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we've always pointed out,
uh, you know, uh, vegetables, a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: vegetables are washed and a lot of those
things are applied.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what makes it agrochemical today is
not necessarily one that kills bugs and
[SPEAKER_08]: fungus and mites and all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one that breaks down safely by the
time that produce gets the whole foods and
[SPEAKER_08]: gets sold through Amazon.
[SPEAKER_08]: So by the time all that process happens,
that thing will have either photo
[SPEAKER_08]: litically degraded, hydro litically
degraded, actually in some cases
[SPEAKER_08]: biologically degraded by other microbes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the whole point of this is actually to
get human studies to actually show that
[SPEAKER_08]: you can effectively use these treatments
in the cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's our efficacy studies that gives
us the label requirements that helps the
[SPEAKER_08]: farmer understand what I do have this type
of infestation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the label use rates.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is the use rates that
basically they have established studies
[SPEAKER_08]: for to show that if you use this product
at these use rates, you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_08]: control this particular pest.
[SPEAKER_08]: And most importantly, you won't have any
bad effects in the products that are
[SPEAKER_08]: derived from that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what's called a registration.
[SPEAKER_08]: That registration costs 10, maybe a
hundred million dollars.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you have that registration,
then you can start selling this product in
[SPEAKER_08]: the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the hill that this company has
to climb.
[SPEAKER_08]: Todd, thanks for bringing this up because
it was a really important.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you're going to see a lot more
conversation about this because California
[SPEAKER_11]: is starting to release these lists of
approved chemicals for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, so a lot of people are going to
be bringing up these questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, they're bridging data without
actually having all of the studies in
[SPEAKER_08]: place to say what happens when that's
applied to cannabis during flower and
[SPEAKER_08]: residues end up in the extracts and kids
are dabbing this on a hot email.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those studies, I can tell you
categorically have not been done studies
[SPEAKER_08]: are done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we have all that safety
information, then they can basically have
[SPEAKER_08]: the freedom to operate to sell the
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those kinds of products.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the approach that they're
taking right now is to use biological
[SPEAKER_08]: control.
[SPEAKER_08]: These enzymes and extracts again are
viewed more spinosan is another natural
[SPEAKER_08]: product that again is actually on one of
the hot lists of what to look for.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get contaminated stuff in Colorado,
there's all kinds of natural products like
[SPEAKER_08]: Neem oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: They really are making incredible claims
now that Neem oil, has some connection to
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis related hypermesis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've looked at some of the data.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that that's absolutely true,
but Neem is supposed to have that effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, God, you know, is there a
correlation between the two?
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows clinical trials will tell.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's good that research is happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't used Neem on my plants in two
decades plus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess if you're facing a huge
economic loss, and, you know, you're
[SPEAKER_08]: pressured to do whatever you have to do to
recover that economic loss, and you're
[SPEAKER_08]: forced to buy some kind of treatment to
help you mitigate your pest.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, wouldn't it be great to have the
knowledge upfront, like I think Ryan was
[SPEAKER_08]: pointing to, and to understand the genetic
susceptibility of certain varieties and
[SPEAKER_08]: certain grow conditions and certain
climates to succumb to certain pests.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe what we would do is,
hey, let's not grow the sour diesel that
[SPEAKER_08]: time of year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's grow the cookies that time of year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Change your cultivation planning and your
cultivation practices based on what may or
[SPEAKER_08]: may not be more susceptible to pests and
diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just, I was just helping a client
lay out a really big growth and they were
[SPEAKER_04]: choosing their varieties, their genetics
to put in, and they wanted to do all these
[SPEAKER_04]: popular market varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because of the regulations that
they're in, they can't, they can't spray
[SPEAKER_04]: anything for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to, you know, so essentially
what we did is I totally changed their
[SPEAKER_04]: grow around and put in only varieties that
were resistant to powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's kind of like, unfortunately
the market dictated that they want,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the most popular things that
would sell really quick, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: cookies, OG, all that kind of stuff,
all the cushions, they're, they're all,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're the magnets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the powdery mildew magnets.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like filling up your facility with
a bunch of stuff that's going to attract
[SPEAKER_04]: problems that you have to deal with isn't
really a good idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: Microscopic problems that you can't see
until they're very, very much prevalent
[SPEAKER_12]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that, that's just a question for
Kevin is that how infected does your grow
[SPEAKER_08]: have to be with powdery mildew to get a
positive result on this kind of test?
[SPEAKER_07]: He said one single spore he could test
for.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't that seem out of, out of track
biologically, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's, that's the way the test
work, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what PCR does PCR again,
for those that don't know, you can Google
[SPEAKER_04]: it, but it's called polymerase chain
reaction and polymerase chain reaction and
[SPEAKER_04]: a DNA method for amplifying specific
pieces of DNA, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that's the beauty of the test is you
can take minute, minute little almost
[SPEAKER_04]: undetectable little, I mean, that's what
they do with the cops do when they go into
[SPEAKER_04]: a murder scene and they can find they'll,
they'll tape, they'll take a tiny little
[SPEAKER_04]: dab of blood that might've been left by
the killer, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they can amplify the DNA in it to
see and, and get a signal out of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's providing that your sample contains
a little bit of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I guess the, the caveat to what
Kevin is saying is if there is a huge grow
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's one spore in there and it's on
one plant in the corner of the room and
[SPEAKER_08]: you sample over here, you're not going to
find it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no, you won't because the DNA has
to be sample that they're testing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's more likely that he's saying
that there could be a single spore on the
[SPEAKER_12]: test sample in the sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I get that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good that it's the, well,
I mean for cannabis anyway, I'm sure
[SPEAKER_12]: there's probably other industries that
have been using this for a long time,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's like Chimera says to get a
hundred or 200 of those in your toolbox,
[SPEAKER_12]: that would be an extreme value.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just imagine if you could swipe a little
piece of a bud on a stick and it would,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, change colors.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it, if it had milled out, in other
words, the grower fucked up.
[SPEAKER_08]: They speak English.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's mildew, mildew, not mildew.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm giving you the European version.
[SPEAKER_07]: You say banana.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say mildew, mildew.
[SPEAKER_07]: You say tomato.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say tomato.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just giving you shit daddy-o.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quite all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mind at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're German.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have both pronunciations copyrighted
and patented, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not, not to mention the Italian and
Portuguese version.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just looking at this county fair
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great first step.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are guys are going by the dominant
terpene, but I think the inevitable
[SPEAKER_04]: evolution of this is that we're going to
get like, this is what we call terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: super classes, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but eventually what's going to happen
is these terpene classes will get broken
[SPEAKER_04]: down another step into, and then they'll
start, but then, then it really will be
[SPEAKER_04]: like, we'll compete against like,
like, for example, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the lime and pine would fit into the
pining super class, but it would be
[SPEAKER_04]: competing against blue dream, which is a
totally different flower, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really, even though they both are
pining dominant, it's really not the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not comparing, you're comparing
apples to oranges, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea, the idea that I think is
the, the, the real evolution of these
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis cups is where you compete air.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, it's like a dog show.
[SPEAKER_04]: You compare huskies to huskies and pugs to
pugs and labs to labs, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you do the best in show,
but you know, really like, you don't want
[SPEAKER_04]: to be comparing the pug to the lab because
they're totally different animals.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're different beasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I like to compare the pugs to a
great Dane because the great Danes always
[SPEAKER_07]: win.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're obviously a bigger, better dog.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, cross the two Sam and come out with
the great pug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cruel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is an important thing that
you're comparing because they are such
[SPEAKER_04]: like, like I said, like the lime and pine,
it's, it's not OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't compare it to OG because they're
totally different types of experiences,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe what needs to be listed is the
top 10 terpenes and in, uh, with some sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of a display so you can see that,
uh, terpene, uh, the pining is got the
[SPEAKER_07]: most.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 50% of the total terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the top three is enough to really
differentiate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a good start.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's, it is enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, if you have a top three,
it's like, now you're, you're actually
[SPEAKER_08]: comparing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a slightly different idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, it falls along less along the
dog analogy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And more along the music analogy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So at a bluegrass festival, they have
competitions and they have competitions
[SPEAKER_08]: for bands, but they also have competitions
for individual instrumentalists.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there'll be a bluegrass, uh,
or a banjo, uh, an upright bass
[SPEAKER_08]: competition, a mandolin competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so maybe a way to do a competition
along this analogy is to do the best in
[SPEAKER_08]: show, which is that, Hey, no matter what
terpene you can pack into it, this is just
[SPEAKER_08]: the best shit and it, and it, and it goes
right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Best in show.
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe the other way to categorize
these is to say, okay, if the terpenes
[SPEAKER_08]: that we see most predominant in cannabis
are these five or these 10, your strain
[SPEAKER_08]: has to fit a terpene dominance in that
category to compete in that competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you use the terpene dominance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I think the more you use rather
than five, do the first 10 or the first 15
[SPEAKER_08]: that are all found in cannabis before you
know it, you'll have all these
[SPEAKER_08]: instrumental competitions as well as the
overall band competition, which is sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: what it's all about.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just an idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the way it'll be also.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're always going to have best in show,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what they are now, but it's
like, you got to give I think you got to
[SPEAKER_04]: give props to the best rose in every
class, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they are such a different,
such a different user experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the experience of smoking an OG or
smoking that lime and pine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're totally different animals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Roses are actually a good example because
the modern rose is not scented.
[SPEAKER_07]: They bred for beauty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I wonder how much of that had to do
with UPOV rules being so based on
[SPEAKER_04]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, it seems like there could be
another, another competition that is the
[SPEAKER_04]: nicest rose.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where does the rose competitions happen?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it only once a year?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they happen all over,
you know, I know they, they do,
[SPEAKER_04]: they bloom in different times of the year,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Depending on the country you're in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the Rose today.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the Rose today competition.
[SPEAKER_12]: That seems to be the big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a mango competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a mango representation every
year where they have representation of
[SPEAKER_03]: every all 3000 types of mangoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to go to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you can see at some point,
somebody will, you know, maybe they'll
[SPEAKER_03]: just be, you know, the, the, the green
crack festival or the, the Hayes festival,
[SPEAKER_03]: things become more specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, becoming a region because some
will become regional genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just, it's just,
I'm looking forward to the evolution of
[SPEAKER_04]: those competitions where they become less
competitive and less dick-waving and more
[SPEAKER_04]: just appreciating of the beauty.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's like, if you have, it's like,
if you, if you win the biggest fog at the,
[SPEAKER_04]: at the county fair, it's like,
that's not that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it isn't, you know, it'd be nice if it
was more about the cultivation and the
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis or the, or the extract and it was
about the ego and the bump in sales.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a lot of people are or, or,
or what, or what we were talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: with forest, whoever donates the most to
children, whoever, whoever, whoever does
[SPEAKER_08]: the most for the industry, you know,
who, who those are the, the different
[SPEAKER_08]: measurement though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, should be the people who help out
everybody and not just, not just
[SPEAKER_08]: themselves and not just push themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those forward, but I'm talking about
comparing apples to apples.
[SPEAKER_11]: So to speak, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just flying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can't really award people like
forest for what they're really doing in my
[SPEAKER_11]: opinion, because we should all be
supporting his work.
[SPEAKER_11]: In my opinion, we should all be.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wanting to accomplish what he is setting
out to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Having a competition where rather than
submitting extracts that you could
[SPEAKER_08]: actually submit extracts rather than some
judge panel to actually patients who need
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I said last week when I told
forest I'm just going to donate whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a personal thing that I said.
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, like forest,
you know, you know, we were supporting him
[SPEAKER_12]: last week.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was amazing to see everyone donating.
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, you guys donated almost 700 U
.S.
[SPEAKER_12]: dollars to the Caladrius network.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that'll go into buying little jars and
lids and stuff for the creams to go in for
[SPEAKER_12]: for some of those kids with the skin
diseases.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's the good work.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not trying to say shut down competitions,
but definitely I hear what both Todd and
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark are saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, yes, continue to have the
competitions.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, wow, like, you know, putting
everything all we're trying to do is
[SPEAKER_12]: figure out ways this community can put
things aside.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, while it's kind of like that,
oh, put a couple of plants in the back of
[SPEAKER_12]: the grow room for a good cause.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, so it's like in this community
when we're doing things, if there's an
[SPEAKER_12]: event where we're going to drop like
twenty three thousand dollars to promote
[SPEAKER_12]: our company because we're all about the
patients, maybe kick a thousand bucks down
[SPEAKER_12]: or something down, some time, some energy,
some focus, something that just shows that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're also and your time, the most
valuable of all commodity.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I toss this out there to your
attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your time and your attention can be way
more valuable than a dollar donation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of my thoughts is also is in line
with what Tim Blake was saying is that,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, they're seeing growers with
outdoor that's really good cannabis having
[SPEAKER_11]: an impossible time to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what that really means is it's
lowering the price threshold that people
[SPEAKER_11]: need to meet to be able to get into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are going to see more and more of
that cannabis going to people that really
[SPEAKER_11]: need it because now people can afford to
give it away and they can afford to be
[SPEAKER_11]: more generous because literally the
stuff's not worth that much in the first
[SPEAKER_11]: place anymore like it used to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this is where people like him
could benefit if we could focus our
[SPEAKER_11]: generosity, because I don't want to say
that the little bits of crumbs that go to
[SPEAKER_11]: the competitions are really what we should
be donating to the kids.
[SPEAKER_11]: We should be giving, you know,
maybe I'm too much of a socialist,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: But I believe we should be helping our
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when I started the San Diego
Compassion Club, I was donating the
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis I had and I was having a lot of
the friends I worked with read,
[SPEAKER_11]: allowing me to redistribute stuff because
once they realized you're visiting
[SPEAKER_11]: hospitals, you're actually seeing people
that are sick that have had cancer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I'll give you pot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was like we just didn't know there
was anyone doing that to give pot to.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's really what the bridge became.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just became the happy deliverer of
other people's generosity.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we all need to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I was asked about that on the San
Diego media, my comment was is that,
[SPEAKER_11]: look, when your kid or your relative is
sick, it's a question of compassion.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a question of capitalism.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so we really all need to get
into this thing of compassion.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, my mom didn't sell me weed
when I was going through chemo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Imagine if that was the situation,
you know, and this is what I think we can
[SPEAKER_11]: all do is we can find outlets like guys
like Forrest and we can forster that
[SPEAKER_11]: generosity and help little kids and old
ladies and people you love.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the whole point of this.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I'm sure that if we hooked up
even Tim Blake with Forrest, that he would
[SPEAKER_12]: somehow involve, you know, it would be a
good thing just to forward the,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, along because people that are
doing big things and making moves always
[SPEAKER_12]: need to, you know, and that's Tim's whole
thing is community and like doing the
[SPEAKER_12]: right thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, like I bet you he would
have a great relationship with Forrest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is your cannabis up in Canada,
is it tax free for patients?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that isn't, hey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not here either.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they subject to GST.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to because it's weird
because medicine typically isn't right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Hill and a whole bunch of people have
been really lobbying hard to get that
[SPEAKER_04]: removed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't charge provincial though,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently, they don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I bet that'll change under the new
legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, the provinces will grab their
piece too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was a test case for California for
the State Board of Equalization because we
[SPEAKER_03]: went with the argument that it is medicine
and the State Board of Equalization said
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taxing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why you we pay an over the
counter tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I saying, well, it should be tax
free.
[SPEAKER_03]: These donations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, unfortunately, we can't get
nonprofit status for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's illegal federally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is no tax right off everything
that we donate, such as we give free
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine to 250 qualifying patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And up to two percent to Berkeley patients
every single year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do that free.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's just the realities of
what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's no ability for anyone to
actually have an ability to actually tax
[SPEAKER_03]: right off something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that we're trying to work on on
the state level right now is I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to be able to donate and give
those patients free cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with the new laws that are being
passed, that becomes much more difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're actually trying to lobby on
Capitol Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, can I point out something that is
fucked up in California?
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't pay tax on your pet's
medication.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, because they they have they have
considered that it creates a financial
[SPEAKER_11]: hardship on the pet owner so that they
shouldn't have to pay taxes on if your dog
[SPEAKER_11]: gets hurt.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if your grandma is going through chemo
and she needs a medical cannabis taxer.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's that's where we got to get into
a different conversation and demand equal.
[SPEAKER_11]: We should at least have equal rights as
pets.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I spent that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent six figures on a lawyer that was
the former head of the State Board of
[SPEAKER_03]: Equalization and still lost.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's not on you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want a small little bump in their
road.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were trying to make a point with
BPG that was a fucked up point.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, now, technically,
they're now in a situation where if you do
[SPEAKER_11]: have your California card, you do not pay
taxes on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the only taxes that should be
collected, and I'm not sure if this is
[SPEAKER_11]: correct going forward, will be on
recreational or adult use sales.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have a California cannabis card,
you will be tax exempt for your your
[SPEAKER_11]: purchases of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that that tax is 15 percent.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that tax is 15 percent.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be January 18th.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is that January 1st?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, January 1st, January 1st of 2018.
[SPEAKER_11]: The tax on cannabis will be 15 percent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I ask you this?
[SPEAKER_11]: On top of the 10 percent we pay or 9
percent we pay as sales tax?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is, to my knowledge, there is no
waiving of the OTC tax per county.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like in Alameda County, we pay 9.0
percent over the counter tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll pay that, to my knowledge,
as well as 15 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in Berkeley, then I have a 2.5
percent wholesale tax and a 2.5 percent
[SPEAKER_03]: retail tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're talking a tax of 29 percent.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what about this?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it possible that we start selling this
herb as medication for dogs and cats and
[SPEAKER_12]: then just let our grandmas and our dads
and moms and all these other people just
[SPEAKER_12]: use it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we get around this?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a loophole we can find?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, can I throw this out there?
[SPEAKER_11]: In all honesty, the people that I think
that the whole medical everybody needs a
[SPEAKER_11]: medical card thing is going to evaporate
when nobody needs a medical card.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the people that are really sick,
you know, are obviously going to continue
[SPEAKER_11]: to be really sick because that's the
fucking cards they would dial.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're going to pursue medical
cannabis use because they have to,
[SPEAKER_11]: not because, you know, they feel like
alternating beer with some cannabis on a
[SPEAKER_11]: Friday night and now they don't need a
damn doctor's note.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think doctor's notes are going to go
the way of, you know, nowhere because
[SPEAKER_11]: you're not going to need it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just going to need to be 21 or
over.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, who's going to need to pay a
doctor a hundred bucks for some freedom
[SPEAKER_11]: papers when you're already free?
[SPEAKER_03]: Patients that don't want to pay those
taxes that so you don't have to pay those
[SPEAKER_03]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Legitimate patients will still be in
relationships with their doctors.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I don't mean legitimate,
like everyone that says they use cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: is illegitimate.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just mean like, look, if you're seeing a
doctor all the time, did you fucking,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, a step away from dying?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not going to change, you know,
so you're going to still be there like,
[SPEAKER_11]: hey, and if you can say 15, 29,
whatever percent it'll end up work on
[SPEAKER_11]: being people should get their,
their, their California cannabis cards and
[SPEAKER_11]: they should have worked the taxes because
it's their right to do so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that said though, even with the
taxes, I still think stuff's going to drop
[SPEAKER_11]: alcohol and tobacco is got taxes on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I used to go get my mom's cigarettes,
when I was a little kid, they were under a
[SPEAKER_11]: buck, you know, and now they're stupid
money.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know how much they are.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I've never smoked them, but they're
taxed incredibly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, BFD, they're still legal and
no one's shooting each other up over packs
[SPEAKER_11]: of cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_12]: 29%.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like such a ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the discussion back in the day is,
Hey, we don't care until it's taxed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just pay a tax on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is what happens when you,
you know, and people are keeping a
[SPEAKER_03]: diligent eye on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the reality of, of, you know,
the potentiality of these local
[SPEAKER_03]: governments that have passed these laws in
the absence of regulation or state
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what the tax on alcohol is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even close to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what it is?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have that in my head,
but apparently I got pushed up by other
[SPEAKER_03]: facts and figures.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes I think of it like this though.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, granted we'll be paying taxes,
but it's not even close to the frigging
[SPEAKER_11]: tax that we've paid for prohibition.
[SPEAKER_11]: An ounce of weed shouldn't cost 100 bucks,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't give a shit what you grew it with
or how much love you gave it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is utterly ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that cannabis into the hands of
the people and whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it'll be nice to see also tested
weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not, you know, basically latent
with pesticides and growth hormones and
[SPEAKER_11]: every other thing we can't see or smell.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and in many ways I, I'm, I look
forward to the change.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no stopping it.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's for certain acres will be grown
sections.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with this also as well, you also
have more labs, you know, because regional
[SPEAKER_03]: areas will now have laboratories so that
people can actually sit and get their
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to elevate everything
because that's when you'll start to see
[SPEAKER_03]: street dealers saying, yeah, this is
tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start hearing that, that's a
whole change in the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no discussion on that level that I
know from anybody who's like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: man, I got this shit tested and here's why
it's this price.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I know it at the retail level,
standardized methods by certified
[SPEAKER_08]: laboratories that have to hold up to a
scrutiny of a third party testing every
[SPEAKER_08]: quarter.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the only way you have to,
you know, these labs have to be watched
[SPEAKER_08]: like any other consumer product.
[SPEAKER_07]: The labs need to be ring tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you say quarterly or whenever it'll
start to happen though.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when the, when the labs
themselves are not, you know, quasi
[SPEAKER_11]: activists for what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, a lot of these people that
initially started the labs are heroes to
[SPEAKER_11]: me because they were facing a ridiculous
fine, like $10,000 per test they did.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he did it anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, this is the kind of proactivity
we need, or we're not going to have an
[SPEAKER_11]: industry, you know, this stuff didn't
start off and nothing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It started out of people risking their ass
and taking a chance and making what is now
[SPEAKER_11]: commonplace science, which is something
that wasn't available.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, 20 years ago, when I was in the
Bel Air place, I got arrested.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was looking for all my own equipment
because there was no labs I could take
[SPEAKER_11]: anything to.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I didn't acquire my own equipment,
I would never be able to get cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: tests of what I was making.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I have three labs and I do
read and test them all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's more than quarterly because you
know, we were kind of, we were pioneers in
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of always been one of those
things where always keeping everybody on
[SPEAKER_03]: their toes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that they're calibrated,
once you have a good calibrated lab and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're actually calibrating their
machines and cleaning it and doing
[SPEAKER_03]: everything properly, as Dr. Sheldon will
admit, you get exact science and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what we need.
[SPEAKER_03]: No more of the hearsay and conjecture
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get real data, replicatable data that
will then spread into these other states
[SPEAKER_03]: that will then spread into these local
regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, cause each agriculture
department in the county or like in
[SPEAKER_03]: Louisiana, you know, I grew up in
sugarcane country.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a, there was a certified
regional representative that actually came
[SPEAKER_03]: and tested and made sure that everybody is
growing proper to the regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the accepted standards for,
you know, what is growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was backed up by actual
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have testers and things that
they can take into the field that are
[SPEAKER_03]: calibrated to that specific, you know,
agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will become that way in point in
time with the, with cannabis where you'll
[SPEAKER_03]: have, you know, even because we had a U S
department of agricultural representative
[SPEAKER_03]: in the region as well to back up the local
regional data and testers and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and laboratory, which will of course,
employ lots of people throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States, because you're talking all
of these regional oversight and things
[SPEAKER_03]: that these taxes are going to go to pay
for that are necessary evils, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: people who hate regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, we have to have
somebody out there that's unitarily making
[SPEAKER_03]: sure everybody is doing things properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise we're back to the same point
where we were before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it's, it's very important steps
that we're making toward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by having laboratories that are
properly testing and then showing other
[SPEAKER_03]: laboratories through ring testing,
how to actually calibrate their machines
[SPEAKER_03]: and get them up to standards besides,
you know, becoming proprietary,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, knowledge, it now becomes
universal knowledge for everyone so that
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone has access to their testing at a
reasonable rate, because let me tell you,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's expensive testing and it costs
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've spent hundreds of thousands,
not millions of dollars on testing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's a necessary evil to get to the
point that where our testing is real and
[SPEAKER_03]: we have real data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that we can actually take forward
knowing that everything we have is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually properly done and tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that everybody else is held to the
same standards, it's, it's going to ripple
[SPEAKER_03]: across the effect because I'm no longer
bearing that personal responsibility,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I have and willfully now it will be
spread across through all these different
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory agencies and oversight bodies
that will actually make sure that one,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not making sure that my labs are
calibrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are standards that are actually
making them happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Agricultural centers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, we'll have hopefully
in the future, organic set standards and
[SPEAKER_03]: certifications so that you can actually go
through the two year process to actually
[SPEAKER_03]: become a certified organic grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you can actually have certified
organic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be the next step.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have to pierce that veil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once that is actually broken through
through these regulations, which we should
[SPEAKER_03]: see here in California, but national
certification may still say that,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, we're going to hold off until it's
federally there because we haven't seen
[SPEAKER_03]: that certification really pop up in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you heard any discussion of organic
certification in Pennsylvania?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Sheldon?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I haven't even heard of it in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I heard of it in the hemp side of
the Colorado industry, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_08]: familiar with it on the medicinal or
recreational side.
[SPEAKER_07]: It happens real fast because Whole Foods
can't sell it until it's certified
[SPEAKER_07]: organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Amazon just bought Whole Foods.
[SPEAKER_07]: So of course they'll force cannabis to be
allowed to be organic also.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, I would expect Amazon to be
the first online deliver of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I didn't say it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You did.
[SPEAKER_07]: So time out.
[SPEAKER_07]: How much did I know they're friendly?
[SPEAKER_03]: They bought Whole Foods.
[SPEAKER_03]: They bought Whole Foods for 14 billion
dollars the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: 13 and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's going shopping for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just through a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, Walmart and those have
had their, you know, their super stores
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's Sam's and their food centers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a huge volley for Amazon.
[SPEAKER_08]: They say that there's about a million
existing Amazon fresh customers.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Amazon's food, fresh food delivery
business.
[SPEAKER_08]: They imagine that that number is going to
peak at about a hundred million.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to go from one million to a
hundred million people buying their
[SPEAKER_08]: groceries through Amazon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazon.com on their phone.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just closing grocery stores down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was interesting because it's like
everything's been going towards the
[SPEAKER_04]: internet in favor of brick and mortar.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now one of the biggest companies,
essentially what they did is they went
[SPEAKER_04]: shopping for brick and mortar,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Amazon bought themselves to dominate
the food market and to change it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fresh food market really is
directly tied to the price of Whole Foods.
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now, their distribution network
has just become this huge web of Whole
[SPEAKER_08]: Foods stores.
[SPEAKER_12]: But watch, you'll see them make a deal
with Tesla and they'll all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_12]: have the first electric vehicles that are
delivering all these things across the
[SPEAKER_12]: country.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark, drones, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just going to have drones flying
around dropping food.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have artificial
intelligent drones.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're going to have driverless
drones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's the meaning of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a huge shoot shout against
Google's delivery as well, because I get a
[SPEAKER_03]: Google delivery where I actually can order
my food and all my non-perishables and
[SPEAKER_03]: they come in boxes to my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I order my Instacart and I can
have all my fresh fruits and vegetables
[SPEAKER_03]: delivered to my house as is right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do this all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even go into stores anymore
because the convenience is acceptable
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's already drones are a concept,
but they're already doing this on the
[SPEAKER_03]: ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: The stores miss you.
[SPEAKER_08]: The stores miss you.
[SPEAKER_08]: The stores want you back.
[SPEAKER_12]: But some people will always love to choose
their produce.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found we found that with delivery of
cannabis when when we were shut down by
[SPEAKER_03]: the government for a temporary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to delivery exclusively.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we found out from delivery
exclusively is exactly that is a majority
[SPEAKER_03]: of people, especially Californians,
are highly educated on cannabis and they
[SPEAKER_03]: want to see their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to be like, here's what
you have choice of this one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to be able to like at the store,
they get whenever somebody asks for a
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic, we pull out three to four
different one of that same kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can pick between those and they'll
be like, oh, this looks better than this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what their their choice is to
just show up with the delivery and just be
[SPEAKER_03]: told exactly that's something that the
market does not necessarily want for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you find that like with your
avocados and your tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_08]: And your produce that gets delivered
directly to your house?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I like to go to the store and pick
out my cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to feel it and smell it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't want someone else picking out
my cantaloupe for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you like that procedure?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's nine times out of 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: They nail it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the thing is, is, you know,
it's listed as what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want organic cantaloupe,
they will pick up an organic cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can select no, that if there isn't
that organic cantaloupe and cancel it or
[SPEAKER_03]: select something else so they can have a
choice where you can select either another
[SPEAKER_03]: organic cantaloupe or conventional.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have that selection in the
menus currently on if that that organic
[SPEAKER_03]: cantaloupe isn't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, could I pick something right myself
better than somebody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Most likely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I said, nine times out of 10,
they get it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, the convenience is better than
actually going down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer to go down to a farmer's market,
to a local farmer's market, which I tend
[SPEAKER_03]: to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even they're doing that now,
they're going to local farmers market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even that takes a hell of a lot of the
guessing games out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Instacart not only goes to my local
market, but on certain weekdays that go to
[SPEAKER_03]: local farmers market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can actually select that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, you're getting organic,
local and locally supporting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where your dollars are going.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just not having to deal with the
driving around the parking and all those.
[SPEAKER_08]: My Instacart is my son and my wife who go
over to Amish farm on the other side of
[SPEAKER_08]: the hill and buy all Amish vegetables all
throughout this time.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, 20 years ago, Woody's wife,
Laura, had a company in Los Angeles called
[SPEAKER_11]: Yoganics and they home delivered organic
fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they gave you a list of all the ones
that were available the week.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you would check them all off the ones
you wanted and they would prioritize those
[SPEAKER_11]: in your box and you would get other stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, we were pretty open minded
to other organic fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_11]: But every week we used to get a couple
boxes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We would get the fruit and we get the
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought it was fantastic because it
also, it really helped the farmers in a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of ways to get to their customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also gave you recipes as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was also, so you got recipes if
something was regional or seasonal,
[SPEAKER_03]: it gave you seasonal recipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it also broadens your recipe base so
that you, if you already had something in
[SPEAKER_03]: mind for the fruits and vegetables that
were coming to you, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you didn't, because we do something
or did something for our hospice patients
[SPEAKER_03]: where it was farm fresh to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a local organic farm and they do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would deliver organic vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: We realized when we were dealing with
hospice patients that cannabis is an
[SPEAKER_03]: essential tool, but it is a tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to take care of your health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eating properly is one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I highly recommend supporting these
types of local box organic vegetable
[SPEAKER_03]: delivery services because you're
supporting the farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if it's not ripe, you know,
as you know, Dr. Sheldon, you just leave
[SPEAKER_03]: it on the shelf a couple of days and it
will ripen in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never gotten past ripe things from
that type of delivery.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've usually gotten things that are
pre-ripe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think they pick them pre-ripe
because they know it's going to ripen on
[SPEAKER_08]: the delivery service.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, how good it's packaged because
certain vegetables will bruise quite a bit
[SPEAKER_08]: when they're shipped.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the last thing you want to get is
an apple that's all bruised up or avocado
[SPEAKER_08]: or pear that's all bruised up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Dr. Sheldon, I shit you not
because I worked in Pennsylvania on a
[SPEAKER_03]: horse farm and I used to go to the Amish
or Amish depending on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to try Amish grown pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you their organic cannabis is
fucking dick in the dirt amazeballs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the Amish grow tobacco?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they do?
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's a market for it and it's
agriculture, the Amish grow it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Amish will grow anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't smoke, do they?
[SPEAKER_07]: By that I meant tobacco.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they're allowed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even a pipe?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, maybe they are.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they're not allowed to consume
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the strict Amish folks,
I mean, they don't use electricity.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't use shoes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're always in bare feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have dirt floors in their homes.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Pennsylvania Mennonites, they have
like motorized tractors and vehicles and
[SPEAKER_08]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you'll see an Amish guy out there with
a team of horses plowing a field like his
[SPEAKER_08]: great-great-great-grandfathers did.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy that they're still farming in
this very, very... They control when I
[SPEAKER_03]: went to the mills, the saw mills,
because I got the sawdust for the animal
[SPEAKER_03]: bedding and they controlled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every time I went down there,
I would actually have to wear long sleeves
[SPEAKER_03]: so my tattoos wouldn't show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, they wouldn't deal with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're that strict still back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're socially about what they are,
but it also depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's different sects.
[SPEAKER_03]: There can be as strict by the book or as
close to Mennonite as even possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have the whole gamut, but for the
most part, they're very strict.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say I've ever seen an Amish smoke
tobacco myself, but I know that they grow
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow everything great.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't fuck around when it comes to
farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Them and barns.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want an Amish barn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they do lots of barn raisings.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the one thing about the Amish is,
again, they know the value of what they
[SPEAKER_08]: bring in terms of marketing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've said this story before, probably not
on Hashtag Church, but we went in one time
[SPEAKER_08]: to buy our turkey.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was a line, again, Range Rovers
and BMWs parked at the Amish place where
[SPEAKER_08]: there's horses and buggies lined up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you basically have these people
who buy their Amish turkeys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this girl behind the counter was
probably like about, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_08]: 14 or 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was rifling through a stack of 20s
like a Vegas dealer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be right with you, sir.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just this very stark image of very
simple lifestyle, but just huge in
[SPEAKER_08]: understanding the business is what they
do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was this line of people out the
door who wanted their Amish this and their
[SPEAKER_08]: Amish that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they know the value of a buck.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I think that is the high note of
Hashtag Church.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we should probably end it on the high
note, an Amish story about turkeys and
[SPEAKER_12]: Range Rovers.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, I said I was going to end it at
12 and it's 12.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was awesome having Tim Blake come in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for that, Todd.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good to see what he's up to.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure we'll hear more from him as
the time goes by, or at least maybe get to
[SPEAKER_12]: see.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe Tony will go and film it or
something and we'll get to see more about
[SPEAKER_12]: how that event went.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess thanks, Chimera, for coming
in.
[SPEAKER_12]: As always, the panelists, Todd McCormick,
Etienne Fontaine, Skunkman Sam,
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark Sheldone, Johnny B and Darren Massey,
who have split.
[SPEAKER_12]: And anyone that I'm forgetting,
I sure don't mean to, Skunkman Sam,
[SPEAKER_12]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think I said it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, everybody, for watching Hashtag
Church this week.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's pretty darned.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Happy Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: I will end it with a picture of my father,
Chief Gary Richardson of the fire
[SPEAKER_12]: department.
[SPEAKER_12]: RIP, dad.
[SPEAKER_12]: Love you.
[SPEAKER_08]: For all those who have fathers who have
passed on like yours, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: RIP to the fathers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for those that haven't, have a great
day with your families and friends.
[SPEAKER_12]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Call your dad.
[SPEAKER_12]: Much love, everyone.
