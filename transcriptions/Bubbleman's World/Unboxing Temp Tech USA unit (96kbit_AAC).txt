[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys welcome to bubble man's world it
has been a while since I posted a video
[SPEAKER_00]: let me tell you I have been busy I have
videos compiled from the Caribbean in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica and I have a bunch of videos from
my recent trip to Colombia that I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be sharing with you today but I was so
excited I like to keep my videos in order
[SPEAKER_00]: but today I got a package that I've been
waiting for for a while thanks to high
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity glass art for turning me on to
the wonderful people at ha at temp tech
[SPEAKER_00]: USA so you can follow them at Instagram at
temp tech USA I'll put it over the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: here and this is a really cool little unit
in regards to in dabbing and temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: so obviously we've had these electric
nails for quite some time now which is
[SPEAKER_00]: great it creates perfect temperature but
it's not quite convenient for traveling so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's all sorts of little different
pipes out on the market from the puffco
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can do your your your dabbing
you know while you kind of go and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: convenient I still love my puffco and my
other convenient dabbing tools but I love
[SPEAKER_00]: my banger and my glass pipe the most so
this is kind of going to be a multi-part
[SPEAKER_00]: walk through it's an open box of attempt
tech of course we'll be promoting DC glass
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner and I'm also going to be promoting
on this particular go one of the XL grail
[SPEAKER_00]: bangers from JP as well as his incredible
see if I can get that up to you guys a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit look at this how great this
stuff is beautiful carb cap fits right in
[SPEAKER_00]: there this is not the core reactor it
doesn't have the big piece of quartz in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom but it is an XL grail there is
the holy grail right there can see you
[SPEAKER_00]: right through it blink blink anyway I've
had this for I bet you over a year since
[SPEAKER_00]: JP and Wendy sent me the Terp slurper the
core reactor and this XL grail huge
[SPEAKER_00]: apologies to you guys for not putting this
video out sooner you can check them out at
[SPEAKER_00]: Toro glass on Instagram and I will put
that up on the screen as well and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: finally able to get to this now one of the
main reasons I haven't wanted to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: is because I've been on the timing game
I've been timing the banger which works
[SPEAKER_00]: great when you're by yourself obviously
most of you are aware of you know heating
[SPEAKER_00]: up your banger with your torch for a
certain amount of time usually 10 to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds letting it cool for 40 to 55
seconds some of you guys are now onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold starts which is much how the puffco
pipe hits you can do cold starts with this
[SPEAKER_00]: as well but this unit this unit right here
which I say we open right away I'm very
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about I've only used it once I
used it over with with high integrity and
[SPEAKER_00]: was just completely impressed with with
everything about the unit reached out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the company and said how do I get my hands
on one and they were like we'll send you
[SPEAKER_00]: one so huge shout out to temp tech USA I
know you probably have companies all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time trying to get units out of you and
whatnot but I'm very happy that you
[SPEAKER_00]: managed to send me one I'm very excited
about the prospect of using it right now
[SPEAKER_00]: you know this unit measures the
temperature of your banger it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: cool laser thermometer built into this
little styly box that they've produced not
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular one but the box inside the
box and we'll show you very simply how it
[SPEAKER_00]: works temp tech USA there we go there's
the picture and I'll show you what this
[SPEAKER_00]: little guy does because it is very very
cool there we go there we go no need to
[SPEAKER_00]: rip only sent me a blue one how beautiful
is that my son's favorite color he'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: very excited not that he'll be using the
temp tech but he just loves all things
[SPEAKER_00]: blue so nice packaging put away nice and
secure definitely doesn't feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's any problems with this unit often
when you open a box on something sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel it and it's shaking and it's
making sounds it's not supposed to make
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing feels very solid so let's see
if they hooked me up with a battery they
[SPEAKER_00]: did they did hook me up with a little
9-volt battery that goes right in the back
[SPEAKER_00]: door right there and this is the unit
there's the tech temp USA so you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: your switch on the back you switch that
you can set your temperatures right here I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess I'm not sure exactly because I
haven't looked at the guide why don't we
[SPEAKER_00]: read the guide and find out exactly what
these buttons do this is what an open box
[SPEAKER_00]: is all about I want it to be the
experience that you yourself would have if
[SPEAKER_00]: you bought one of these so the specs our
temperature range is between minus 50 to a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand and twenty degrees Fahrenheit so
between minus ten and five hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: forty nine Celsius Celsius we're never
gonna go that high let's be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy is between plus and minus two
percent that's great I can handle that
[SPEAKER_00]: response time is about point eight seconds
emissivity emissivity it says see the
[SPEAKER_00]: table on the back page for emissivity
values of some common materials a more
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive emissivity towel table can
be found at temp tech org pages emissivity
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivity table I'm not sure what that
means but I'm interested to learn about it
[SPEAKER_00]: distance to spot ratio 12 to 1 operating
temperature between 32 and 122 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit storage temperature between
minus 4 to 122 and of course required
[SPEAKER_00]: battery is 9-volt now it says the further
the target the larger the test area is as
[SPEAKER_00]: the distance between the temp the test
object and the temp tech increases the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the area being measured also
increases below is a sample ratio using
[SPEAKER_00]: the formula used to calculate the distance
to spot ratio interesting so it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: distance to spot ratio times test object
size in inches maximum measures distance
[SPEAKER_00]: in inches eg 12 to 1 times 2 equals mass
maximum measure distance of 24 so that
[SPEAKER_00]: just shows you how far away you need to
have it so let's go with our setup here
[SPEAKER_00]: install the battery and move the power
switch to on all right we'll do that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if to set emissivity move the
power switch this one's not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: turning on move the power switch seven to
the off so let me see what we got here
[SPEAKER_00]: move the power switch seven to the off
well I think what happened is is they put
[SPEAKER_00]: a battery in but they turned it on and
shipped it on so the battery is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: completely dead so what I will do is I
will go find a battery and I will be right
[SPEAKER_00]: back this is all about the open box
experience right you got to figure it out
[SPEAKER_00]: it says to possession the sensor under the
target object when temperature readings
[SPEAKER_00]: are complete move the power switch to the
opposition the scanning will stop
[SPEAKER_00]: additionally the data holder indicates and
last temperature reading will be displayed
[SPEAKER_00]: additional adjustments while the temp tech
is powered on press the Fahrenheit Celsius
[SPEAKER_00]: button to toggle between Celsius and
Fahrenheit or press the backlight button
[SPEAKER_00]: to toggle the backlight on or off it
should be protected from thermal shock
[SPEAKER_00]: allow 30 minutes for it to stabilize
before use induction heaters arc welders
[SPEAKER_00]: and electromagnetic fields objects of
higher temperature so I'm gonna go find a
[SPEAKER_00]: battery we're gonna get this thing
operational and I'll be right back well my
[SPEAKER_00]: apologies to the company they actually put
a brand new battery in here but they said
[SPEAKER_00]: it just on top so the battery was that
wasn't actually plugged in the battery is
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed and will require opening so good on
the company for not doing what I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: they might have done which was potentially
shit me a dead battery it's often the way
[SPEAKER_00]: you think when you open these products you
kind of constantly I know what happened
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened it's not working and it's
it's a true open box experience I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to give you one of those you know
polished up everything's working perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to see exactly the experience
that I had which I have to say was
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly not too bad so we're gonna go
like this that little battery in there
[SPEAKER_00]: hooks up nice and easy close the door and
now we're gonna turn this on so hold all
[SPEAKER_00]: right install the battery move the power
to set emissivity move the power switch
[SPEAKER_00]: seven to be off position then press the
function buttons three to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivity adjustment screen I don't think
I'm gonna be messing with that screen at
[SPEAKER_00]: all I will use there we go let's see I
want to go between I'm on Celsius but I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go to Fahrenheit so there we go so
Fahrenheit we're at seventy two point
[SPEAKER_00]: three percent it's funny because I'm
Canadian and obviously we use Celsius up
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada but when it comes to dabbing
it's very much been an American thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: has inspired us with the electric nails
and so on so we've gotten very used to
[SPEAKER_00]: operating with a under Fahrenheit rather
than Celsius so I know Fahrenheit I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to hit around 550 to 575 I've got my XL
grail in the bong I haven't talked too
[SPEAKER_00]: much about this but I have some absolutely
beautiful beautiful bubble hash from
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated X this is 120 micron wedding
cake try to take some macro photographs
[SPEAKER_00]: for you so you can see that up close and
then we also have some really lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry banana look at that quality
this is the six star when you hit the six
[SPEAKER_00]: star the last thing you want to do is hit
it in a way that it's too hot I'm loving
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea of being able to use this thing
and not have to you know it's as simple as
[SPEAKER_00]: this right here actually that's how we're
gonna use it we're gonna just put it right
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and first we'll heat up the
banger probably only for about 10 seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to heat it up for 20 but there's no
real reason to go much past if I can get
[SPEAKER_00]: it up to 700 degrees and then let it drop
50 to 100 degrees or you know 150 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting right at my perfect
temperature so we're gonna simultaneously
[SPEAKER_00]: try out the temp tech the XL grail from JP
the concentrated X full melt then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna clean with the DC glass cleaner I
wish I had some glob mops because I could
[SPEAKER_00]: promote that company too and of course
shout out to oil slick for our oil slick
[SPEAKER_00]: silicone that the pipe is sitting on and I
guess shout out to Big Shot from Blazer as
[SPEAKER_00]: well so quite a few different tools that
are required for this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology of dabbing whatever you've got
use it maybe join me I will say that one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the main reasons I haven't used this is
if you see my DC banger that I've used see
[SPEAKER_00]: how cloudy it's gotten from not being able
to clean it properly now that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily chas as much as it's just not
being able to clean running out of DC
[SPEAKER_00]: glass cleaner not having q-tips and not
always knowing the right temperature you
[SPEAKER_00]: know these bangers change you get used to
one banger you end up with a different
[SPEAKER_00]: banger while I traveled I had the hotbox
mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: hotbox banger which was double the depth
of this and half the thickness well
[SPEAKER_00]: because of it had held heat very
differently and I found that it was at 30
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds or less I could be hitting it
without having to let it cool for for 40
[SPEAKER_00]: or 50 seconds so these are all different
things that you have to worry about when
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have a temp tech USA we've got
one here today so why don't we get on it
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: oh I don't have a dabber on the table let
me go get a dabber real quick actually
[SPEAKER_00]: after those few seconds let's see what our
so that's 630 degrees 626 degrees how much
[SPEAKER_00]: I heated that up was almost perfect so
we're gonna have to redo that a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go grab a dabber because I think
getting some of this wonderful hash out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar and into the banger is going to be
pretty essential so once again bear with
[SPEAKER_00]: me all right and one more company to shout
out D nail for the dabber here so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice little dabber that fits right on
their halo dish and actually fits
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly on my DC XL banger as well we're
gonna be using the JP grail and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard hash to get out I often find
that you want to cover the top of the rim
[SPEAKER_00]: as you're digging around because it can
fly out and end up everywhere worst-case
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario in your eye I have on the other
hand broken off a nice little piece so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get a nice little dab nothing too big
often I get asked hey why are you taking
[SPEAKER_00]: such small dabs why you why don't you hold
it in like long enough why don't you will
[SPEAKER_00]: listen I damn how I dab I can hit 50 dabs
in a day if I want I can hit five and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same freedom as well so hit the
dabs that make you the most comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: whether those are micro dabs because
you're new at this or whether they're half
[SPEAKER_00]: gram dabs because you've been doing it
forever this is the spice of life that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis offers us so just do what you
like I'm gonna take a nice decent dab out
[SPEAKER_00]: of a brand-new banger so I'm very excited
the mothership Klein is as clean as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whistle so let's try this again shall we
keep that banger up for about 10 seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: all right we'll drop that right over there
700 800 degrees I got that up to it's now
[SPEAKER_00]: at 766 750 748 734 so you can see it going
down so pretty fast so probably around 650
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna hit it this is gonna cool it
down substantially and I'll probably get
[SPEAKER_00]: that five 55 75 hit so we are at 650 let's
do this
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely perfect temp and now my banger
is at 463 degrees Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow incredible flavor on that strawberry
banana 120 micron bubble hash shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: you concentrated X for finding that phenol
shout out to DNA for putting it out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and just shout out for me for puffing it
right now and being in full enjoyment
[SPEAKER_00]: level level 10 so we got a nice perfect
perfect temp rep the banger will be very
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to clean thanks to the no chas aspect
of hitting the temp tech hitting it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: temp perfect temperature we're really
going to be able to experiment and find
[SPEAKER_00]: out what is the temperature where chas
occurs is it in the 700 is it in the 800
[SPEAKER_00]: degree is it a particular quality of oil
this is just cleaning perfectly which is
[SPEAKER_00]: you know how you want to see a brand new
banger clean when you've just hit it for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time I just it's cringe-worthy
when we make the bangers you know get
[SPEAKER_00]: chassed and get that foggy kind of look to
them so I will be a little bit insane
[SPEAKER_00]: about cleaning this just because
cleanliness is next to godliness skunk man
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam has always said and yeah eventually
you're cleaning and you'll see your your
[SPEAKER_00]: q-tips are no longer getting dirty
beautiful so there's a nice clean banger
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for another rip and the temp tech
USA is is a great success I mean how sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: is that just to have something that's this
light and portable uses a battery
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously I'm probably gonna want to carry
it in its box and make sure that secured I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want it banging around in the back
of my bag I could probably break this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing pretty easily it seems a little bit
delicate but in regards to a tool that is
[SPEAKER_00]: available that's not a big thermometer
that you have to hold a laser thermometer
[SPEAKER_00]: in your hold I think this company has done
a really cool job fitting a niche that no
[SPEAKER_00]: other company has fit and of course we've
seen the tochi which is the big heat gun
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the unit that heats up the banger
more like the beam but quite different
[SPEAKER_00]: from this I think this particular product
is going to have great success in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry I have been super
excited to use it when I first saw it I
[SPEAKER_00]: just thought what is this high integrity
glass art being the connoisseur that he is
[SPEAKER_00]: I left an open mind and I thought after
one single use that this was a tool that I
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely would require and need to have
so I guess turning it off after use is not
[SPEAKER_00]: a bad idea it says once you're done on the
instructions to to turn this the power
[SPEAKER_00]: switch off once once it's done scanning so
maybe it's simple to turn on and off each
[SPEAKER_00]: time I'll learn more of these simple
nuances of the unit as I use it over time
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just absolutely wanted to share how
cool it was with you and in the meantime
[SPEAKER_00]: do a long you know a video long in waiting
and long in coming for the JP Toro grail I
[SPEAKER_00]: do still have the core reactor and I still
have the turp slurper that you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing videos from and then I'll probably
do a video maybe with Flav and some super
[SPEAKER_00]: sick glass where we have all three of them
and both of us hit each one and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: give our sort of what we think of that of
the hit this core reactor hit beautifully
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very big I personally love a large
surface area it's got the ground glass on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom with the grail into it which
gives it more visibility when the oils on
[SPEAKER_00]: there which also seemingly made it a
little easier to clean and what a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful carb cap this is one of the
nicest I've personally had nice big hole
[SPEAKER_00]: on the top that you can seal right out and
then it's got that little you know bent
[SPEAKER_00]: nozzle at the end that is going to give
you your full spinning and ratio I think
[SPEAKER_00]: this would work quite well with the
sapphire comets that I got from D nail
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't tried yet but I'll throw in a
couple in the meantime I'm probably gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to puff here and enjoy some of
these vibes but thank you guys for
[SPEAKER_00]: watching and thanks for supporting
companies that I believe in temp tech USA
[SPEAKER_00]: is one to watch for DC glass cleaner
obviously most of you will already know
[SPEAKER_00]: about that concentrated X bubble hash
maker and JP from the for the toro grail
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you all for making this video
possible and I guess I'll finish it with
[SPEAKER_00]: my most classic may the full melt bless
your bowl sooner than later peace out
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody you
[SPEAKER_00]: you you you you you you you you
