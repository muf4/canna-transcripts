[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to be talking about dry
sifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do a series of tips much the way
I've done with the water extraction with
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess basically the point of dry
sifting is that we're extracting the
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichome heads from the rest of
the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like bubble process, the only real
difference is that you don't have the help
[SPEAKER_00]: of the water and this is major.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the water keeps everything afloat
in the water extraction process,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of makes it a no-brainer for
anyone to produce a product that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: purity of 99% pure gland heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing this with dry sift is a much bigger
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, right off the bat I would say
tip one, dry sifting is not a misnomer in
[SPEAKER_00]: the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want dry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't attempt to do this with fresh
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways of doing it using dry ice
but it's extremely high in contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be very gentle with the work
and I find that there are better ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly with a tumbler or a screen,
even just bouncing material over a screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: using a bubble box, using all these
different sort of tools that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: available to you, you can acquire sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now because the water is not there in
sift, you're going to end up with a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've made really nice sift,
you're still going to end up with 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've made a low grade sift,
you're going to end up with approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 to 90% contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these little tips that I'm going to be
releasing on my YouTube channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try and keep them short,
will be helpful in getting yourself to
[SPEAKER_00]: that next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tip number one, dry your material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get the material dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In third world countries, where they've
been making screen hash since the 60s,
[SPEAKER_00]: the key has always been to allow the
material to become dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't think about the plant matter
becoming dry as much as we need the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: matter to be bone dry because once that
occurs, then the wax membrane on the
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichome can start almost
dehydrating, much like a raisin from a
[SPEAKER_00]: grape or a blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you shrink it down and dehydrate,
it gets all sort of these ridges and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: show it in some of my photos what it looks
like when it's a fresh gland head as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to what it looks like when it's a
dry gland head.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that wax membrane dehydrates and
dries out, that is when the product is
[SPEAKER_00]: really ready to dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make your initial
extraction easier and it's going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: your cleaning easier as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to get into the cleaning in
the next tip, but basically this is tip
[SPEAKER_00]: number one, use dry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry your material out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of you bubble people think
that you need to run your material fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: and preserve terpenes, but this is a dry
sift process and because we're not washing
[SPEAKER_00]: any water soluble terpenes away,
there's going to be a good amount of them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured while we're talking about dry
sift, I could also maybe smoke a few
[SPEAKER_00]: bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, I just got back from
the house of the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really had a great time over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got some wonderful strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sweet skunk, one of my all time
favorites from Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the original cut of sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the island sweet skunk crossed
and weakened.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the real deal right here and I
figured I would take a little puff with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been cleaned by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was single screen extracted by Matt
from the house of the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our last video you saw that and then I
managed to clean it up to the next level
[SPEAKER_00]: and here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the flavor on that is just
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemony citrus goodness with these hazy,
hazy undertones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really are under that fruity,
lemony, hazy rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to share with you a hit of the
barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also cleaned up to 99% heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular hash is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the one hour that Matt ran through
the pollinator produced a fairly high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been cleaned by me to 99% and I
can say that it is absolute fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a giant rip of this stuff yesterday
and almost gave myself an anxiety attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even to feel this, even to touch this
resin, it does not feel like your everyday
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, that's a contender right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't surprise me either that it was
Shishkeberry Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really what put bubble bags on the
map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go, barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm gonna continue on smoking
through these great dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of varieties here from
D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some from House of the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit from John Burfellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to give a shout out to Nickatee,
lab life brother, wearing the shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the love in Amsterdam this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to chilling again with you
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, bubble man out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
