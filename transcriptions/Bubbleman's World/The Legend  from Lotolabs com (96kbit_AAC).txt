[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome to bubble man's world
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am here with yet another unboxing video
This came from the good folks over at
[SPEAKER_02]: Lotto labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never actually seen this unit In real
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd only seen pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of an electric dab rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't compare it to The puffco
although I did see them kind of comparing
[SPEAKER_02]: it to the puffco, but I'm pretty sure it's
a wired device So it might be more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: comparison to like a vapix hail or a unit
like that So it's supposed to be a unit
[SPEAKER_02]: for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it It looked pretty cool and it
looked like something I wanted to check
[SPEAKER_02]: out So I guess we'll start with the small
box first probably some of the accessories
[SPEAKER_02]: that came with the unit That's usually how
it goes
[SPEAKER_02]: Sticker in the front there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we've got a Dabber I believe
it's a glass dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to be careful with that Put
that right there Dabber These are gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: components that I saw Yeah, so there's the
you piece that goes underneath the pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched on their website at Lotto labs I
basically watched the guy, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know put it together from right out of
the box So hopefully I'll be able to get
[SPEAKER_02]: this right and I won't have too many
pauses in here, but I guess we'll see
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we've got this is the magnetic
bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a little nail that fits in
there I remember seeing it's probably in
[SPEAKER_02]: here So I'm not even sure how this thing
works I don't know if it's the nail that's
[SPEAKER_02]: conducting the heat and create like I
really am NOT too sure what the design Of
[SPEAKER_02]: the pipe is, you know, I've seen it on
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen it in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So okay, and then there's that All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, just the nail must be with the
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll keep this stuff separate and Then
we'll open up the big box
[SPEAKER_02]: Shipping details Interesting Nice little
case Lotto labs doing it up, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual unit here Nice packaging Aren't
you glad you always look Lotto labs
[SPEAKER_02]: accessories stand and the read this first
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well might as well crack open that
accessory stand nice little wood stand To
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose hold these components.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even sure if that's what that's
for or not Probably not these this must be
[SPEAKER_02]: for the dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course All right, so put that
there so let me just check I guess this is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably just an empty case that the piece
goes in Oh, yeah, look at that as keys and
[SPEAKER_02]: it has nice high-density foam cut into it
for all of the components so that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty nice touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna lie right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Seeing this you want to push
out the box to remove the sleeve.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to watch these videos I have to
admit I know that their video was probably
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, there's a picture of the unit right
there actually So it's nice to have these
[SPEAKER_02]: unboxing videos and I'm sure they did a
much better job at it than I am But hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have different people and it might
be still nice for you guys to see so
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than just send you over there You
can watch this one and then you can go
[SPEAKER_02]: over there And watch a proper unboxing
video All right, the two subceptors are in
[SPEAKER_02]: the black.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two susceptor are in the black
silicone carry case.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you So, let's see this is
cut out really well there's your base And
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your glass And then there's your
silicone cases as well as more of these
[SPEAKER_02]: little guys little dabbers and a pipe
cleaner Which is always nice Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's what they're talking about the
susceptors I guess these are little nails
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the nails and then Okay,
I've got all of these other components
[SPEAKER_02]: again as well All right, so let's start
with moving this over here I Know that how
[SPEAKER_02]: they started was by unscrewing the bottom
The grommets already in so that was not in
[SPEAKER_02]: in the actual original Such
[SPEAKER_01]: a strange angle for this
[SPEAKER_02]: I Think that's right Head over to the
little labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's the step-by-step.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a season the magnetic nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember that I remember this part
goes in here So this little part comes off
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the little guy you will slide this
into there All right, right, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: so this will click into here I believe
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we got that figured out
basically The grommet was put in the wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: way when it came so I confused me I went
and watched and now it makes sense I've
[SPEAKER_02]: got the little you pipe actually gave us
another one So this little guy goes under
[SPEAKER_02]: here the long piece goes right into the
center and the short piece goes into The
[SPEAKER_02]: grommet that this center piece of glass
that slides down into they're making it so
[SPEAKER_02]: you basically have an all glass on glass
on glass hit so We've put that base on
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can put the bottom of the unit on Which
is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna want to put water on here You
put water up to about a third of the way
[SPEAKER_02]: down Put a little water in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh That's just about perfect right there
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay Then we're going to drop This little
guy on right so that goes on top of that
[SPEAKER_02]: then you have this little I guess titanium
nail That's open on one end and closed on
[SPEAKER_02]: the other and it goes inside this little
piece of glass and that little piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: glass goes right there and then Yeah,
I guess you get your pipe right there your
[SPEAKER_02]: pipe cleaners and your little dabbers and
then it's just a matter of pulling out our
[SPEAKER_02]: electronic components for this And I might
pull up a chair and sit and have a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: dab with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how this unit works I'm always
excited for new technologies when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: to dabbing always always interested to see
what people are working on And I always
[SPEAKER_02]: think that the next best thing is right
around the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not to you know Not pay close attention
to the work That people are doing and so
[SPEAKER_02]: Lodo labs caught my attention with this
little unit soon enough We will have an
[SPEAKER_02]: idea so Right in the front there,
so you push on the button.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a light and then I guess Blue
being the coldest and Pink being the
[SPEAKER_02]: warmest There we go, maybe didn't goes to
red yeah, it does go to red so you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: that tiny little bit of smoke that just
came out that's that little bit of That
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of seasoning that's coming off
the nail any time you've ever used any
[SPEAKER_02]: type of metal component You know that it's
a good idea to make sure that that is
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean before you start hitting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way it said on the well It says
right here important make sure to turn
[SPEAKER_02]: legend on and off for each session Oh
before using legend you must see The
[SPEAKER_02]: magnetic nail the susceptor to do this
turn the dial to red and leave it on for
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 to 20 seconds Let it cool for five
minutes, and then you're ready to begin
[SPEAKER_02]: All right Make sure you turn legend on and
off for each session legend there legend
[SPEAKER_02]: heats extremely fast The biggest mistake
new users make is leaving it on for too
[SPEAKER_02]: long five to ten seconds is all you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so Let's cool that down Yeah,
it's got quite a coil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wrapped around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna pull up a chair
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably wait that five minutes and then
I've got some flavors right here I'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: starting on the lowest temp for this
particular unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's got a great little Great little
how-to book that shows, you know in really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice clean photographs shows the whole
process I mean, this is simple simple
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple I like this Okay Power level zero
blue no heat level one a little darker
[SPEAKER_02]: than purples level two Much more purple is
level three then sort of a pinkish is
[SPEAKER_02]: level four Then we're getting into red
level five and then almost an orange level
[SPEAKER_02]: six So also there's error modes if you
leave the magnetic nail out I guess what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens is you don't get that heat It
doesn't heat up and it'll start flashing
[SPEAKER_02]: on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll flash Orange three times when
it's over temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll flash orange until susceptor is
inserted When you leave that out,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's also Bluetooth You can Bluetooth
download the app press and hold that
[SPEAKER_02]: button on legend legend will enter pairing
mode and flash a teal blue color The
[SPEAKER_02]: legend will hold a solid teal blue color
when the device pairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta get my phone Alright, so let's go
see if we can't find the app The app
[SPEAKER_02]: unlocks will control of your legend go to
okay, so you got to go to load Oh labs get
[SPEAKER_02]: the lab no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is all part of it Lodo Lodo labs
calm Lodo labs calm Backslash app so
[SPEAKER_02]: that's easy Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome over the age 21 little legend iOS
app little locks iOS app I want legend so
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna go iOS app.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is a nice picture The pipe will
go get So go to Lodo labs download install
[SPEAKER_02]: the app on your phone open the app and
follow the directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay I'm gonna download this because we're
waiting for this to cool anyway right now
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will download After downloading
the app and following the directions you
[SPEAKER_02]: can pair legend with your phone press and
hold down button on legend legend will
[SPEAKER_02]: enter pairing mode and flash a teal blue
color the legend will hold a solid teal
[SPEAKER_02]: blue color when the device pairs Well,
let's see how easy that is so far It's
[SPEAKER_02]: been very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll create an account.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this Let's be bubble man Let's do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, you got to put the what you're
that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put bubble man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't I put BC bubble man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't put I Didn't actually put at
iCloud calm just definitely good to have
[SPEAKER_02]: so now we're gonna Sign in that was very
easy to set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to wait for them to send me
an email or anything like that They let me
[SPEAKER_02]: pick my own password fast enough and I
guess they're a new enough company that
[SPEAKER_02]: all the names haven't been taken yet So
that's kind of nice Okay, so I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: hold this down All right, so there we go
connect to legends We are connecting Pair
[SPEAKER_02]: yes pair We want to pair with this guy
Register this legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes name your legend bubble man's Bubble
man's legend and there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my legend here.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's all paired up I can put it on
whatever I want easy enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool No, I'm definitely
controlling this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Want to do a fairly low temp dab,
but I don't want to do a cold dab I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do a super hot dab So they did say
it was 10 seconds or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what this thing can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they give me a carb cap?
[SPEAKER_02]: It must have a carb cap, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can't really imagine it not having
a carb cap Let me see if we missed the
[SPEAKER_02]: carb cap Maybe there is no carb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this works carb free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that was interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never hit on a pipe before that
didn't have a carb that actually still hit
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty damn good now I Think I heated it
up a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm gonna even go for a lower dab
But one of the things I read in the book
[SPEAKER_02]: is that it gets up to temperature very
fast five to ten seconds So I suspect this
[SPEAKER_02]: unit is a unit That you want to have your
dab ready when you turn it on almost like
[SPEAKER_02]: the Dream cold start unit and that's what
I'm gonna do for the next dab Because I
[SPEAKER_02]: know I've hit this resin enough that it it
just had a little bit of a different taste
[SPEAKER_02]: almost like it got heated up to 750
degrees instead of 680 and Lately because
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the temp tech USA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've really been paying close attention to
the taste of the hit and Associating it
[SPEAKER_02]: with that actual temperature of that hit
so Definitely got nice and lit off that
[SPEAKER_02]: hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's let's go again and let's go almost
right away this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, that tasted fire Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a carb mine got it
[SPEAKER_02]: Important for the low temp dabber Make
sure you turn it off right away because as
[SPEAKER_02]: fast as you're hitting it it's heating up
and so I think This unit is pretty damn
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way it's different,
you know, you know, it's still a pipe But
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a little bit different than what most
people have been coming out with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, that's magnetic that holds right
in there and that's real nice that just
[SPEAKER_02]: pulls right out and this will be super
easy to flip and clean so Actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: see how hot that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have Q-tips I was gonna use but I'll
just do that later on Pretty cool little
[SPEAKER_02]: unit all around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the feel of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that It's different and then it's
not that same old same old bong I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like people who are new to cannabis and
maybe new to dabbing might find this of
[SPEAKER_02]: interest Really clean unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The glass just goes on and off real simple
real easy to turn on and off and You know
[SPEAKER_02]: works obviously with any dabber that you
have Yeah, not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that getting a great tasting hit
out of this Probably won't take me much
[SPEAKER_02]: longer than three or four more hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even my second hit was just tremendous And
then it even gave me that smoky hit
[SPEAKER_02]: towards the end of it So for those of you
that want to get that wasted to taste it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that cold start where you really
get that enjoyable rip But then you also
[SPEAKER_02]: want that punch with it at the end you
leave this thing on even on a low
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature I didn't go up to red.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine this thing must be at a
thousand degrees at red Probably something
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B would like for his pain Shout out
to Lodo labs for sending this to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the unboxing video I will be
using the unit over the course of the next
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of months and I'll let you know how
it holds Up whether the glass is sturdy
[SPEAKER_02]: whether the components hold up how the
pipe fits and feels in my everyday You
[SPEAKER_02]: know office life how it sits on my table
and how other people react to it as well
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay tuned for more on Lodo labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check them out at Lodo labs calm
They're also on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: May the full melt bless your Lodo labs
legend sooner than later Peace out
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody Strike lightning as the morning
break my heaven's open why the Sun was up
[SPEAKER_00]: in my face the wisdom of the wise keep my
head straight With the speed of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamite Try to perfection, small fin
finicity, I love the street like home.
I love the street like home.
