[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B is in the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Puff Wednesday!
[SPEAKER_06]: Puff Wednesday, dude!
[SPEAKER_07]: For 2015!
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, holy smokes!
[SPEAKER_07]: It's our Puff Wednesday!
[SPEAKER_07]: When's the last time we even did a Puff
Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, you know what happened there?
[SPEAKER_07]: We were getting ready to go to Amsterdam,
and you went to Jamaica, and it's been a
[SPEAKER_07]: few months, and we got busy, and I hurt
myself, and just a bunch of... it's been a
[SPEAKER_06]: while!
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been a while, but here we are,
Puff Wednesday, you guys asked,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we are giving you your request.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not exactly sure what we're going to
do today.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might head on down to Mega Ill Pizza,
and order ourselves some medicated pizza
[SPEAKER_06]: and cheesecake, because that was such a
good time last time.
[SPEAKER_06]: That cheesecake was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really tasty, really a great vibe
all in all, and I hope that we can make
[SPEAKER_06]: that happen today, but we figured,
because we were sitting here puffing
[SPEAKER_06]: bowls, and eating CBD caramels from the
great gardener, and sweet grass extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Sarah, for these beautiful
gifts that you shared with us up in
[SPEAKER_06]: Whistler.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have a little bit of a
problem because they were in my pocket,
[SPEAKER_05]: but... Yeah, I can already see I'm going
to get into this here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind having a tiny little bit of
parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just peel it off with my nails.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we were sitting here talking
about the Instagram deletion, the great
[SPEAKER_06]: deletion of Instagram cannabis accounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big accounts, small accounts, little
accounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just amazing what's going on with
Instagram is they're just deleting
[SPEAKER_07]: accounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw The High Society, who has almost
300,000 followers, has only eight photos.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was good to see his account was up,
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the followers were back before it was
just gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't find Weedstagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's definitely some something going on
with Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I personally was just telling John how
I stopped really posting on Instagram
[SPEAKER_06]: daily, about maybe six months ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you guys know, I've been posting a
lot more videos.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really more attuned to this sort of
interaction that we can get on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that would still bum me out big time
if my Instagram account got deleted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people put a lot of work into it,
but we're even talking about whose
[SPEAKER_07]: accounts are being deleted and which ones
are still there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's just it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're seeing some big accounts being
deleted and we're seeing the advertising
[SPEAKER_07]: part that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the weed content?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I know the one account that was
recently deleted was the Medtainer
[SPEAKER_07]: account.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't have just weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a lot of everything else on
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really came to think about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't always do all marijuana,
but everything they do is advertising.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every post is advertising.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there something around that with the
advertising?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because your Instagram is golden.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today it is, but maybe tomorrow it's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_06]: If BC bubble man disappears, I'll
definitely open up another account and
[SPEAKER_06]: post all those photos as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I managed to, I was telling John earlier,
I keep all my Instagram account photos
[SPEAKER_06]: right there in an account.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have, this is just from 2014 here,
but I have all the years of my photos from
[SPEAKER_06]: the months of my Instagram uploads.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do that because a lot of times the
way people get in touch with me,
[SPEAKER_06]: they see my stuff on Instagram and then
they want to either get a collaboration
[SPEAKER_06]: going for like a clothing line or they
want to acquire a photo for a magazine or
[SPEAKER_06]: a book.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll often be like, Oh,
here's the picture I want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I have to know where in my
photos, and I have 80,000 photos over 15
[SPEAKER_06]: to 17 years, cannabis photos, it becomes a
little bit ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's always the one they want was
always the one I could never find.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went through all of them and added
them into this folder.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and now it's an easy thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever I, so that's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have your Instagram account,
you're a little scared.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great idea as you load accounts,
you know, it's a bit of a pain in the
[SPEAKER_06]: butt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause most people do that Instagram solely
through a phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for me, my, my Instagram 420 we
master is, is, is nothing but my grow
[SPEAKER_07]: logs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I've used it for.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't average it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've used it as my grow logs.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just, I'm, and that was another
thing we talked about is, is the
[SPEAKER_07]: legalities and say the U S in Europe or
Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know in Canada we're legal,
I'm a legal medical patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm doing nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: For all we know, the feds approached
Instagram and said, take down all the pod
[SPEAKER_06]: accounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are using that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, maybe they, they don't want that
in the U S.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe also though, we know high society
and Instagram or in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of freaky.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is free.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit freaky, but let's just puff
bowls and not think about that too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what I liked was, uh, you know,
your little backup program, but what
[SPEAKER_07]: people can do just, you know, get on top
of it, make sure you back up your files or
[SPEAKER_07]: share it on another, um, another platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready for some warlock?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm waiting for some warlock.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you had the Congo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had Congo when I first walked in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Haven't dabbed it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been growing it, but definitely have
not had a good dab of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here is some warlock for Johnny B on
puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B brought me a few plants as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, um, two that I've been waiting to get
back for a little bit here, which was the
[SPEAKER_06]: Congo and the Jamaican cut that I gave him
originally.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you were the first person I gave
that cut to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So go figure.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would be the first one to give it
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You said, I don't have the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first thing I said was I have to bring
it to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first one that you need to
have.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and of course the Congo, which is just
such a sweet smelling, tasting strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great way to welcome in 2015 with
some beautiful genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might crack some seeds this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just cracked a new seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just popped.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be something that well, um,
it's, it's going to be something new.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a definitely something that's going
to, well, I gotta, I gotta see how it's
[SPEAKER_07]: going to taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was this the one that your Congo crossed?
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't see any males or any ham.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking, I'm thinking the banana and
if there was one might've came off the my
[SPEAKER_07]: little pony beside it and that would have
been in my grow back in September.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so, um, I was definitely checking that
out and I do have, and it wasn't like a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot cause I smoked the whole plant,
of course, and I got like six seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one side on one bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a one bud that got a little bit of
pollen on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What, what my little pony?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, number four female.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank God.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to get sticky against
sticky.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see whatever happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that, uh, yeah, it'll be nice to
see some Congo, uh, uh, new, new Congo
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_07]: New Congo things.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if maybe the people that aren't
into the Congo being out there,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe they'll be okay with like a,
a nice Congo cross being out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hit the JT 15 Justin Trudeau.
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin Trudeau.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to hit the Justin Trudeau?
[SPEAKER_06]: He supports legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's a politician trying to win an
election during a time that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_06]: the hot topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not quite sure that that has
everything to do with his personal agenda,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I can definitely say that only a few
years ago he had a more negative tone when
[SPEAKER_06]: it came to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to hear that he has a positive
tone, but, uh, I get in trouble for this
[SPEAKER_06]: often.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I'm really not a believer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll support the party that, that
everyone's supporting for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm just not a believer that even
voting people in gets them in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I'm a believer that people who
create that sort of power aren't going to
[SPEAKER_06]: let it go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so readily or easily.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just my own personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel free to fire some, uh, accusational,
um, sociopathic borderline comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I find the whole platform a little
dangerous where the conservative
[SPEAKER_07]: government is issuing license producer
contracts to all these license producers
[SPEAKER_07]: and Trudeau is screaming legalization and,
and what we're going to have is,
[SPEAKER_07]: well, everybody should just grill their
own marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Up here in Canada, everything is
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why I was just saying it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just on my mind and I always refer
to it as cannabis because it is my
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, there's definitely a fight
going on up here in Canada where the U S
[SPEAKER_07]: is actually legalizing certain States and
the feds are like, okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's, here's the problem I have with
thinking that everyone could grow
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's you, you yourself, uh,
have a pension so you don't have to work
[SPEAKER_06]: and you are able to spend an enormous
amount of time focused on your love and
[SPEAKER_06]: passion of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you imagine if you did?
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just think of that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, I'd say 80% of the people out
there, maybe more are not in our position
[SPEAKER_06]: to be able to just like my desk is covered
in hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: My there's plants over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's plants over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's plants downstairs.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's hash everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like my sole focus.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm able to like focus on it and still I
find it very difficult to grow the enough
[SPEAKER_06]: high quality resin just for myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do this 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on the computer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have pickle jars full of hash?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tubs for sure, but not pickle jars.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, has tubs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt has tubs like this and he runs a huge
facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to run.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this one's full.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have tubs too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a second here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very hard to grow just a simple gram
of full melt resin for yourself every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: The problems you come into with.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a 12 by 12 room and I really,
um, do you think you grow 365 grams of
[SPEAKER_06]: resin?
[SPEAKER_06]: No way.
[SPEAKER_06]: A full melt?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're working your ass off.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a big grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got like 11 different strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not enough medicine for the amount of
work that you're putting in and many
[SPEAKER_06]: people won't be in that situation to do
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has to be, and I've gone back to
this a few times.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the idea of letting everyone play,
you know, so the reason the government
[SPEAKER_06]: gets involved and the reason there are,
um, licenses for such things, just like
[SPEAKER_06]: there is in the food and alcohol and other
industries, is due to the fact that
[SPEAKER_06]: standardizations need to be in place to
protect the end user, buyer, whatever you
[SPEAKER_06]: want to call them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or her.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't you agree?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is set into place because they
look at getting something where it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be dangerous to the public or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where they're not producing molds or
pesticides or anything.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm all for a certain system where
we're able to get a proper standardize.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It means that when you've got a beautiful
cross, and you find out there's a bug or a
[SPEAKER_06]: mold or a mildew or a microbiological,
whatever, you got to get rid of that crop
[SPEAKER_06]: and no one in the herb world does that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, they would need to be forced to do
such a thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason they would need to be
forced is through something like
[SPEAKER_06]: standardizations.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know your shit's going to be tested
and you know your shit's contaminated,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're not going to try and bring that
forward to be tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we're dealing with big commercial
facilities, dealing with the public.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but not my own personal girl.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's, that's why I think this guys
like you and me who want to grow for
[SPEAKER_06]: ourselves, we maintain our licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't pay big money for it and we don't
sell our, our herb or hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next in line, you've got, or sorry,
at the other end of the line, you have
[SPEAKER_06]: what the Canadian government is trying to
push through right now, which is licensed
[SPEAKER_06]: producers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, which in my opinion, isn't really fair
to everyone that would want to be a
[SPEAKER_06]: licensed producer because they're making
the investment so huge, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: three, uh, $8 million or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Massive security.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, it just seems to be that if
they're making it also very hard on that
[SPEAKER_06]: end, those guys have paid for their
licenses, big money.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they, they've paid the price to be able
to sell cannabis, to be able to put
[SPEAKER_06]: everything in place and to be able to
control their standards to a point where
[SPEAKER_06]: it'll pass the tests.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good with that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then in the middle, what we need is
the micro breweries.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need the small time grower that's
bigger than John and I that does want to
[SPEAKER_06]: sell his, his or her works for a little
bit of profit because they're a great
[SPEAKER_06]: grower with great genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to help people, but they just
love listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a ton of people that love growing
weed that want to help people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm telling you a huge percentage of
them would not pass the standards of,
[SPEAKER_06]: of what is going to be in place.
[SPEAKER_06]: The standards of having no microbials and
no powdery mildews and no bugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a hard thing to, uh,
it's definitely, it's a hard thing right
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in the middle of the winter and,
um, shit, I'm going to go biological and I
[SPEAKER_07]: have to get predator mites because I'm
getting a little bit like where they come
[SPEAKER_07]: from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's, it's just like,
it is hard in the end and it is when you
[SPEAKER_07]: come down to sterilization.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you were talking about how you
completely cleaned your whole time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You wiped it down with bleach.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wiping down everything in my room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be that guy that's going to
have to like, shut everything down,
[SPEAKER_07]: kill everything, redo everything from seed
and then go ahead again because of the
[SPEAKER_07]: infestation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what a great lesson in the sense,
why would anyone fight that experience?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that experience is what's going to
push you throughout the other side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much stronger as an individual,
as a grower, as someone that like,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, like if you can't maintain and
control something, then it's time to clean
[SPEAKER_06]: everything out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's another great reason when
things are healthy and you've got your
[SPEAKER_06]: moms, for God's sakes, give those clones
away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give those cuts away to people that are,
you know, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a lot of research on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people are looking at the
clones for looking at for different yields
[SPEAKER_07]: and they have different ecstasies.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, like you say, I'm nice to more
and more reading growing from seed is just
[SPEAKER_07]: more beneficial and more rewarding for
any, a lot of your small time growers,
[SPEAKER_06]: you get some seeds growing from seed is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, bigger growers, of course,
when you're not worried about your profit
[SPEAKER_06]: margin, you know, but then again,
clones are nice in the sense that once
[SPEAKER_06]: you've found that genetic and it's perfect
for you because I found my share it like
[SPEAKER_06]: the way you just brought me my 20 year old
Jamaican seed today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's, I wouldn't have been as
stoked had you brought me seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have been stoked for you to have
the seeds, but I would have been like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it would have been good to have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the story would be like,
Oh, but you would definitely, every seed
[SPEAKER_07]: has a different efficacy, a different
pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_07]: So of course that Jamaican seed,
there's only that one type of profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what the hell should we do today?
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we go to mega ill and eat some
pizza?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're going to be doing something
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're definitely going to do something for
2015.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just going to be more about
celebrating this new year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm quite excited to see what's going to
be happening with, with cannabis for 2015.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of hype around.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of big stars behind it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of controversy and, and actually a
lot of positive notes going on with
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis for 2015.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe this year is going to be one
of the biggest years we see complete or
[SPEAKER_07]: slowly legalization being happening all
over the country, all over the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good prophecy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of prophecy, I was speaking with
him in the new year and St. Thomas
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamaica, very good to hear from prophecy
for those of you that don't know prophecy
[SPEAKER_06]: is a good friend of ours down in Jamaica,
an artist.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can check them out on YouTube by
Googling prophecy and either puff and pass
[SPEAKER_06]: a video that I cut for him in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: John was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might even be in the video.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, body bags, a track that he did as
well that, uh, both those tracks are
[SPEAKER_06]: great.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a new album coming out and we
love, uh, we love prophecy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love to support prophecy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout him out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are in gem rock, which I wish was in a
couple of days because I believe it's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be Tony rebels birthday again,
really soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I posted, um, a little article on
Facebook today about, uh, from the lawyer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, what was his name now?
[SPEAKER_06]: We should know the right names.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go through my computer here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems to turn itself off and quickly
show you this little article.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was written.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically talking about how,
um, reggae artists and the Rastafarian
[SPEAKER_06]: people that have promoted and supported
and front-lined cannabis use and the
[SPEAKER_06]: availability, uh, et cetera, et cetera,
for decades to pass now should have a
[SPEAKER_06]: space reserved for them in all of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, for what?
[SPEAKER_06]: So he wrote legalize it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this is, uh, Lloyd was his name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lloyd Stanbury.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can check him out on he's a Florida
based attorney and music business
[SPEAKER_06]: consultant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he wrote his belief is that reggae
artists, especially Rastafarians should be
[SPEAKER_06]: afforded a special place in the future of
marijuana in Jamaica and globally for
[SPEAKER_06]: their steadfast endeavors towards herbs,
decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you can check out that article
through my Facebook or you can Google
[SPEAKER_06]: legalize it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marijuana's relationship with reggae and
its future prospects in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, I think it's, uh, it's got some
potential.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were driving here and then halfway
here, you were like, Oh, I gotta go back
[SPEAKER_06]: to a doctor's appointment.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's one of those things that
reminds me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to have a reminder.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might need earlier reminders.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that you've had that you realized you
can get multiple ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the purpose or two where you get
like one, two hours or even three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, why not right in the morning when
you wake up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, there it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget about it a couple of dabs later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get another reminder.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I have to remember is that
yoga starts at nine 15.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great to hear that you've been
keeping up with your yoga.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's only going to do,
I think that I will say this, you will see
[SPEAKER_06]: John start looking better and better and
become healthier and healthier as he does
[SPEAKER_06]: more and more of this yoga.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just no avoiding it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it just, I'm learning so much and
it's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be able to feel how I am and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course it just comes a lot to just
dedication and learning how to deal with
[SPEAKER_07]: your pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one more reason than how I deal
with my pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's facing it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is facing it more so than
covering it up or, I mean, you go into
[SPEAKER_06]: your pain with yoga.
[SPEAKER_06]: No medication takes you into your pain and
you go in on a cellular level and then you
[SPEAKER_06]: use your breath and your blood to,
to, to kind of milk that pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: To milk that pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: That emotional resistance.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went into a broken toe yesterday and,
you know, it was something amazing that
[SPEAKER_07]: yoga can do for you is exactly what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, like you said to me,
you said it to me for a long time and then
[SPEAKER_07]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Glad you did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you Christian for turning me on.
[SPEAKER_06]: He asked me every day for two years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and once again, I, uh,
Christian was, I'm pretty sure that I met
[SPEAKER_07]: when I first fell.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to go down and, uh, remember
when I first got my accident, I walked
[SPEAKER_07]: into a yoga studio back in 2006 and I just
walked in, walked out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on commercial drive where you were
talking about your friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it took me that long to get back in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just next door like a year prior.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go do some stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're going to go do some stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're taking you guys with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Puff Wednesday's on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So please roll up some joints,
pack some bowls, um, heat up your electric
[SPEAKER_06]: nails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fill your torches and let's get this puff
Wednesday started.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's cool about them.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just starting the ride here and it is a
beautiful day out on the house sound.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you actually Google a global news
horseshoe bay, January 7th, dolphins and
[SPEAKER_06]: whales, there was hundreds of dolphins and
I guess a couple of whales that were
[SPEAKER_06]: spotted and they made a little video about
it today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, just south of my house in horseshoe
bay, just where you catch the ferry to go
[SPEAKER_06]: to Vancouver Island, to Bowen Island and
to the sunshine coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're just heading down what is known
as the sea to sky highway.
[SPEAKER_06]: This highway takes you from Vancouver to
Whistler and to Pemberton past Squamish,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, past, you know, well really Pemberton,
I guess is the end and then it ends at the
[SPEAKER_06]: Duffy road.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just thought you guys might find that a
little bit interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently there's an inversion today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to see an incredible
weather inversion with the fog,
[SPEAKER_06]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_06]: the clouds pushed down below the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll show you guys a little bit of that
when we get to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently this inversion stopped
planes from leaving Vancouver Harbor today
[SPEAKER_06]: and it caused some delays and maybe even
some cancellations of ferries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we are coming out of the sun and
into the fog.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what John and I have decided to do
instead of heading right, right,
[SPEAKER_06]: right to mega ill is that we're going to
go burn about an hour up on the top of
[SPEAKER_06]: Cypress, spend five or 10 minutes with you
guys up there, show you the lookout right
[SPEAKER_06]: now and show you, show you what it looks
like above all this fog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it looks really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm expecting that it's just going to be
all clouds and no city and barely any
[SPEAKER_06]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see you up there in a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're now on the road up to Cypress
mountain, one of the local ski resorts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got three just overlooking Vancouver
and north and north side of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a Seymour, Grouse and Cypress.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the furthest one over to the
west, close to I guess West Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it is in West Vancouver actually,
this particular one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're heading up this road and it goes
for a few kilometers up, up, up,
[SPEAKER_06]: up, up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the early part of the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not very steep, but it will get
into an extremely steep grade very soon,
[SPEAKER_06]: 18% or something, somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like we're getting out of the fog
and into the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're probably only going to be a few
hundred meters above the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: In our lookout, but it's going to be
awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys will dig it for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great place to get a view of
Vancouver from above.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're like tourists not from here and
you want to check it out, make the short
[SPEAKER_06]: trip to Cypress Mountain lookout.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out in the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm talking about right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clarity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just looked to the right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are not going to believe this.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're heading up to the turn here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to turn into the lookout and I
don't want to ruin the surprise for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not going to show you guys what it
looks like right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give you a little tease as we
pull into the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are ye Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we getting a bull ready?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, we're getting bulls ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: We came here to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came here to poke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, how about that weather inversion,
boys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sucks for sledding, but great for video.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, here, that's the best part.
[SPEAKER_07]: See where that mountain is?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's Mount Baker.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I live.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go check out Johnny's spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's sunny there and it's sunny at
your place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's grab the tripod and we'll walk them
over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unbelievable weather inversion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful weather inversion.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm talking about right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Weather inverted.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's the mountain Johnny was talking
about, Mount Baker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Off in the distance looking slightly epic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't that look epic?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, so sick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wake up to that every morning,
that mountain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mount Baker.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your mountain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that mountain is in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for snowboarding that mountain.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sick footage, eh, John?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty sick footage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here we are, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We made it up the mountain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking a little bit in the truck,
as you heard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we're up here at Cypress Mountain
at the halfway point.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably not even quite the halfway
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to hear a lot of cars going
by because we're around a major turn.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's even, in fact, a bus coming by
that's probably going to drown out all
[SPEAKER_06]: sound in about three minutes, or I should
say 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's load a bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just making sure that I have
everything organized for the dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see, we have a weather
inversion up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't lying.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over this corner, there's a tree in our
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're not filming this way,
but Mount Baker, which I showed you in the
[SPEAKER_06]: video earlier, the mountain that's very
close to John's place in Abbotsford.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see Vancouver Island in the
background.
[SPEAKER_06]: That whole mountain range is Vancouver
Island.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in front of that, we basically just
got clouds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clouds covering the entire city of
Vancouver right now, which is going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty cool, because we're about to head
in there to go to Megaill and have a
[SPEAKER_06]: serious puff down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Serious puff down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some good food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometime in the next hour, because we've
got to enjoy this for a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got to hit the abs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to be able to medicate when
you're at the medicate.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a perfect spot for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking today about the effects of
your mood and how it kind of affects your
[SPEAKER_07]: mood when you see something like this in
front of enjoyment, along with a nice ball
[SPEAKER_07]: on the wall.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes you just feel so much more like
London.
Agreed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to heat that up again and
we'll get you one of those?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little dab will do you, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: on Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: On a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first Puff Wednesday of 2015.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Cypress Provincial Park.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a way to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And representing Tri-Cone Head Extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Jibs and to Ken and the whole
River Rock United Cannabis crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a beautiful day it turned out to be
after spending a week up in Whistler,
[SPEAKER_06]: where it was, you know, cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, really cold, but obviously you
guys saw that we were in bobsleds and we
[SPEAKER_06]: were on snowboards and we were on
snowmobiles and in tube parks and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's definitely nice to be in the
warmth right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: 10, 12 degrees?
[SPEAKER_06]: 15 degrees?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's maybe up here, but not down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an inversion up here, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I woke up to sunshine, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I got to your place, the sun was
shining when we came around the corner.
[SPEAKER_07]: My date gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_07]: CVD Renee?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see John's no rookie when it comes
to letting me know where he's heating the
[SPEAKER_06]: nail, because if I don't pay attention to
that, which I haven't been, and in fact,
[SPEAKER_06]: if he didn't tell me, I probably wouldn't
know, then you put the dab in the wrong
[SPEAKER_06]: spot and it doesn't heat up properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always good that you let the person
that you're heating anything up to,
[SPEAKER_07]: or sharing your medicine with,
or bong rips, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just communications, everything,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about communication.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit cool in that spot,
but just heat her up a bit, and I'll get
[SPEAKER_06]: you your fresh heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, it tastes like candy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like, okay, just a little tiny dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing major.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a little, a nice little pick-me-up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more of a refresher than a lightness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny D.
[SPEAKER_06]: Huff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cypress Provincial Park.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try cold, heavy extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: River Rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bubble Bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medtainers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Skiing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Snowboarding.
[SPEAKER_06]: DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Community in the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cloud 421.
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could keep going for hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep going, you're burning up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, we're gonna continue to
do this as we do, and we'll bring you with
[SPEAKER_06]: us when we leave and take you to Mega Ill
Pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: For now, let's just enjoy that view.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just heading down, and there's really
beautiful golds and blues coming out
[SPEAKER_06]: through the sky and through the trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not sure if you guys can catch that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see in between us is Mega Ill
Pizza right across the street.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got ourselves a nice big sign,
and we're about to head on over there for
[SPEAKER_06]: some medicated pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn price.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, people are letting us go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a few people, the other people are
driving as fast as they can.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna stop right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we are at, look at that,
Hemp Pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the Hemp Pizza now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Bubble Man and Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: here inside the Mega Ill.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've just learned that there's some new
rules at Mega Ill, and so we're gonna let
[SPEAKER_06]: the gentlemen... Matt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt and... Amit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amit.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna tell us.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna tell us more about what's
going on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all right, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So take us through this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take us through the changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take us through how we go about ordering
some medicated pizza from Mega Ill.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically now you can put your order in
here, and if you want to smoke,
[SPEAKER_08]: you do it next door, and this is our
non-smoking side, so you bring the whole
[SPEAKER_08]: family.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some new pizzas to choose from as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some thicker crust on some of those,
eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got medicated and non-medicated
pizza for families.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if Mom and Dad want to be able to
medicate, they can have the kids' pizza,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they can be all happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And every dose is tracked, so no one's
gonna get a mix-up with any pizza.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all with your name and your card
number, maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sign up for a membership or something?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we're in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got our MMARs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're good to go, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should be allowed to order pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, as long as we keep fighting the good
fight.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we should order some pizza here,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what do you say?
Yeah?
[SPEAKER_06]: We already know that you're going for the
full-on vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, that pierogi looks pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just lose the bacon.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's like sour cream, hash browns,
green onions, caramelized onions,
[SPEAKER_05]: cheddar.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plain Jane, mozzarella.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plain Jane is my favorite, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do love me a good Plain Jane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super cheese is nuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super cheese looks pretty nuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's like an eight, eight-incher.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we share a super cheese,
Johnny?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a super cheese to share, and then you
want to get another pizza?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm gonna order a Plain Jane.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going for two?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just a small.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two personals?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get a small personal for myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can share the super cheese,
just get half.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can also order yourself
another wonderful pizza if you like.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this, remember the eating of
walnuts, avocado, caramelized onions,
[SPEAKER_07]: basil, arugula, sliced apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like your style, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Walnut reduction, fresh grated parmesan.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: Caramelized onion, arugula.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rambo, that's what you got last time,
I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You should probably try something new.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to try something new, and this
eating was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of Garden of Eden,
truth of life.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we're going for.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a little small East.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a personal Plain Jane, a personal Eden,
and a large super cheese.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a personal super cheese, just a small.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just a personal super cheese?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a large.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three personals?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, a personal each and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought we were gonna make sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be good.
[SPEAKER_06]: All three of them will be made.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what happens when we start
medicating?
[SPEAKER_07]: I always think large already, because I
already know once I start eating pizza,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna start doing some dabs,
I'm gonna get more hungry, and it might be
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we get in 1.5.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a 1.5 edition.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're gonna go smoke next door.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should set up a dinner next door and
have everyone ready, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we pay for our pizzas right now
here or what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medicate me.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're gonna go next door and
set up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys can make our pizzas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so Johnny and I just got to
Mega Chill.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Benny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent, Benny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to meet you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I see you got a little dab bar set up
over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mini Morpheus.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little Mini Morpheus in the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, Mini Morpheus?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mini Morpheus.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ready to blaze?
[SPEAKER_06]: He even put the same marking on his ear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to blaze?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'd like to cook.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: So they got a little dab bar set up here,
this is lovely.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, I'm really stoked here,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready to go, we got an email already going
on over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it, and it's a 2.0.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's confused me, but I'm pretty
sure I'll figure it out pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's why.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: My cable.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna double up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: My 2.0.
[SPEAKER_06]: My new whip.
[SPEAKER_06]: My new whip.
[SPEAKER_07]: The new whip, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you checked out my new whip?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of have to admit, I really still
miss this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: This gold one, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see how it sits straight all the time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's curled forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way it stops it from kinking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it just kinked, and now I can't get
it un-kinked, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the end of the world,
but.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a highly educated, and so this one
I just brought.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the brand new one, so it might be a
little different than the one you have.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get rid of this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got Horatio in the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Horatio?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're already filming?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you just?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're already filming?
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't I already say that?
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just go order one right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you need pizza?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of pizza would you like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-exotic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go next door and order one pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Horatio needs a pizza, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gonna have to get him a pizza right
away, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So grab him a menu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get him a plain Jane.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plain Jane.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plain Jane, yeah.
Plain Jane.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put that on right away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right here, I'm gonna get you a little
pipe on the side.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'll turn it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the next thing to turn on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we've got ourselves all set
up here at Mega Chill.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a little bit shocked when I went to
Mega Ill, and he was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: no, you can't set up your thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not really allowing smoking,
and the health department or whatever said
[SPEAKER_06]: no smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they still allowed them to Medicaid
pizza, which I thought was really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he brought us over to Mega Chill,
which is literally attached to Mega Ill
[SPEAKER_06]: right next door.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a little dispensary here,
a dab bar set, so John and myself and
[SPEAKER_06]: Horatio, we each have our own D-nail set
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess Matt's got one set up on the
side there.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll have to lean in every once in a
while and say hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might grab that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, we're set up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our pizzas are getting cooked right now,
and I guess so, too, should we.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm able to grab this D-nail here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do this up.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the heat on it?
[SPEAKER_07]: 977?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're definitely going to turn that
one down to about 741.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got over there?
What?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get an L-H-Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never mix rigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned that from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have two?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I clean my rig every time I want to
switch.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys have cleaned your rig almost
three or four times a day, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you need water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bong needs water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone gets a dry polo ventriloquist.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last time John and I came to Mega Ill,
this is a funny story.
[SPEAKER_06]: We probably puffed about 25 bowls,
and there was no water in the bong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a wide angle end, so you're in
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we're just going to watch that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Turned up too hot or something?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's at like 900.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine's up at 730, and people say it's too
hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You rocking 350?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low and slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low and slow?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long gap.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get it right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works for my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only for people who have long,
deep chest pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say 730.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, it's 420.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like some TV.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's checking people out over there,
of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Many Morpheus.
[SPEAKER_07]: She, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want me to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we almost.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Congo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just being with someone over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it to 740.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, pretty much 900.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kills it.
[SPEAKER_02]: 900's a bit hot, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely made for us, instantly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, that was like, oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a few people bitching at me recently
for heating up the quartz banger that I
[SPEAKER_06]: got.
[SPEAKER_06]: This quartz banger I got is 3.5 mm thick.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the thickest one I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have brought it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I heat it up, and I don't really get it
to orange hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just heat it up so it's close to orange.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, I hit the hit fairly
soon, right after, when people on YouTube
[SPEAKER_06]: are flipping.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give it 45 seconds!
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, 30 seconds at least.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like, dude, like, I don't,
I think if you were here hitting this,
[SPEAKER_06]: you would understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I understand low dab temperatures
I've hit from three, 50 up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it works much better for oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, super, super low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even 20 more degrees for a super,
super low sift hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minimally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or else, even I can't finish it.
[SPEAKER_07]: 70 for a sift hit might be a little high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I jump up 20 degrees to three.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's 370 Celsius for sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: 350 sift for oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's basically 700 in some
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which we're set perfectly up right over
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very, very happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means I can hit this rise sift right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also, it's a 40 second pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coo coo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta make sure that I don't steal these,
these things are like, lighter as you
[SPEAKER_07]: guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you see one of these, you hold onto
it as like, your most precious.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, wow, this one's new.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's that Rene that, do you have any
of the CBD Rene left?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one I want to, as long as we
get into it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get a sniff drop.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of Warlock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Afghani, Justin Trudeau 15, and Congo 90.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got Malick on the side here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh dude, trust me, I was tripping on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't even smell nearly as strong
as it did smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's, smell this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now your nose is, why I bring it here,
but just smell that edge, compared to the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD Rene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Pineapple Express.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the closest smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same, but when it comes to
relation, that's the closest relation I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever gotten.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's this famous Pineapple Express?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pineapple Express is Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian times trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of why I, I smelled that and
I'm like, well, the CBD Rene isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: related, but it's, it's really,
really fresh smelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's maybe it's just that fruity
freshness that jumped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why it seems so much liber than,
you know, your typical bud smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just smells real fruity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's different, there's always
different lights, there's different
[SPEAKER_01]: growing methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I can get a chance to even try
the same strain from two different growing
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the LHL Pineapple Express,
but it's smell just, it's wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like a real fruity where
everything is more just the smell of weed
[SPEAKER_01]: plus a scent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the CBD Rene seemed that same
mouthwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might try to bite this.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is almost the anti-resin in the
sense that it like, it kind of clears the
[SPEAKER_06]: palate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like you're getting high,
you're getting high.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you hit this and you're like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: At a certain time after a certain event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Re-sabotage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just tried that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the CBD Rene.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you were hitting some of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, trust me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to take your last hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay, I'll probably make more.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is part of the hash task in 2014,
so it's like.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying to erase the past?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it is what it is and there's
some other goodness in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to puff the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, clear the slate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can start working.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to crack those seeds,
you've got to puff that hash, you've got
[SPEAKER_07]: to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems to be growing season for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every month feels a bit bigger to get that
strain, either put it in the flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go into flowering myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just with a few plants, but Johnny brought
a few more by today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got my buddy Tim dropping a few more
off.
[SPEAKER_06]: D420K was going to get me a few.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically all the folks that I've been
sharing cuts with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, everyone's getting loaded.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a couple back at you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to get them back there.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: My tents are cleaned and I mean cleaned.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm laughing because of the squeaky chair.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you might hear this a little bit too.
[SPEAKER_06]: The squeaky chair?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to see me very still here
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're having a little bit of a squeaky
chair puff down here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That mega chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I definitely think everybody,
even on Facebook, everyone's like this
[SPEAKER_01]: year squeaky clean has many standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everything I do to go whether it's
hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it seems like finally the folks
like ourselves who are OCD and just have
[SPEAKER_06]: these sort of standards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Set upon us through the need, not the
want.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need it to be that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like we have a disease or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a mental illness or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it personally, but other people
don't need it, but now they want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that it's kind of come around that
people are like they actually want
[SPEAKER_06]: standards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because man, when I started doing this,
people were like, whatever man,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a change from...
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they'll still say it today,
but they just not anywhere is near.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, put it this way, dab bars didn't
exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: People didn't have dab bars.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no like maybe real pizza place
that'll get medicated pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, once cannabis, once we all got the
recognition, it's medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then everyone's like, well, if it's my
medicine, well, I don't want my medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a cat hair in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: My medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within the producer and the individual,
everyone's like, God, somebody else is
[SPEAKER_01]: relying on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is that guy saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OCD.
[SPEAKER_01]: OCD people are usually the ones that write
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can learn it and pick it up on
YouTube, then fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adopt it, take it in and apply it in your
own life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to choke you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to take out a bit of
the choke out of your head.
[SPEAKER_06]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the sorrel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jaritos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the cane sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biscuits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one more bonus when you're here at
Mega Chill and Mega Ill.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got these sort of natural cane
sugar drinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm drinking the Bonji mango.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mas fruta.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mas fruta.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this, this, I just did a rip of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how you have your finger up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's paint.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at dinner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was just so chill about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gets it at Mega Chill.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't fit that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we've got something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mercy.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little mercy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little mercy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carry over your mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: See?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not a, look, it's a mango.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know exactly what it's a mango.
[SPEAKER_07]: A boat, a boat, a boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those different essential oils.
[SPEAKER_07]: A boot.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're Canadians.
[SPEAKER_07]: A boot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what John was talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: A boot.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of dozen peets coming around the
corner here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have the tiniest little taste
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the particular number two,
you know, and it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Move some of our hash.
I think it's time to move hash.
I think it's time to move some hash.
Let's put it in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pizzas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pizzas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's used to a camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's done this before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Plain Jane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you a Plain Jane?
[SPEAKER_07]: This isPacainty.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're a Plain Jane.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the Medicator.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just take this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just in case you're wondering if it's
medicated, there's a giant And financial
[SPEAKER_06]: aid out of dough right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: To get this down here, I think we should
each try a piece of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just diving right in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to rip a piece of the end as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want the end?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just gave you the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicated with CBD today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Natural crust.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of crust do you guys got going
on?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an imported Italian flour mixed with
a whole wheat stone mill.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then a little bit of semolina.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give it a little kick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little hemp hearts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost thought there were some hemp
hearts in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the relationship between
cannabinoids and essential amino acids
[SPEAKER_02]: will be very interesting to see unveiled
in the upcoming decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much where cannabis starts to draw
in everything else it would naturally want
[SPEAKER_01]: you to do to get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get healthier and stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to a soda to pour in the mango
juice is just the natural thing that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis education and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did the cat take out of my bag?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's some of my napkins for you Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely have the cat going after
him.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, this is what's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: This cat is actually trained to go after
the hatch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to continue to eat and we'll
catch up with you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what's this one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Turks?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Turks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, smells very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turks, Turks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't personally gotten to play
myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much plant matter did it take for you
to get that?
[SPEAKER_06]: One pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get about three grams of pure turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not all the turps from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was aiming for was the type of
turps we lose in the drying process.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pound fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pound fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then five pounds fresh makes one pound
dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going off of it that way, this is the
water from the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't turps swirling around in water
and then invigorating the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually the sweat of that water
from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this is the alcohol in the water as a
separate fraction from this water.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you go about going through these
processes if you don't mind sharing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could say what I got was a big mass of
this cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I started the fractional distillation
process that I'm using to pretty much,
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew I could potentially split it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get this big mass of cloud and then
out of that you can pull out the clean
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then out of both you can pull out the
isolated terpenes of just the floral
[SPEAKER_01]: essence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the most volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if I freeze this, this is going to
do what you smell when you freeze sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most on fire guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I keep this up, it's going to burn off
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even this will ruin my hands for the
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still in the normal bud that remains
is all the terpenes that make a pineapple
[SPEAKER_01]: press.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are only lost terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of why I had that question for
Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it all of G13 or is it just what G13
loses from bubble hash, dry sifting,
[SPEAKER_01]: curing, or the other processes?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he'll have to explain that in a
way when he explains what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be really when people have a
fuller understanding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know one thing is that, I'm not sure
about these two, but the pure turps,
[SPEAKER_06]: they have special lids.
[SPEAKER_06]: The inside of a lid, Tony had them,
they don't dissolve from the salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty much the last of my steam
distillation set from 2004 glass vials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But normally I would either keep them in a
state where they could never hit the lid
[SPEAKER_01]: in a long tube, corked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't expect anything to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you don't expect things to work,
you don't typically have what you need
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, true enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, very cool that you managed to get
all that done.
[SPEAKER_06]: The three levels of turp water are very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turp water to cloudy to pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I take a swig of this,
this is the one that's got that bitter
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine taste, where this just,
oh yeah, that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could pay for that in multiple ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's rose water, any other essence.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the strong stuff that everyone's
fighting for and there's no known value to
[SPEAKER_01]: the price because when you start splitting
them off and it's not just, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99% lemony, 3% mystery elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a bottle of those mystery
elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no known value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because these are all perfumes that
have only been made by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing anything weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to be a magical future in
which every strain, if I can keep this
[SPEAKER_01]: process up, starts again because this
becomes literally what's in the grove.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is as close as it gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I smelled that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't planning on it today,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely smells just like pure turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to bring you a frozen bud so
that you could check out and undry them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then get it sniffed off and go,
okay, that, I smell there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That must be what remains in the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start your floral essence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm excited about because a
lot of us never ever get to experience
[SPEAKER_01]: live plants and that's a whole other
therapeutic experience that's just like
[SPEAKER_01]: roses in a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bringing that to the forefront,
you know what, you guys take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For granted, I smell it and I'm like,
that's like that one time I was privileged
[SPEAKER_01]: to smell it for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a little stash of it and it's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you brought it today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was privileged enough to try it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just hit an Afghani hit and it
rocked me wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_06]: I felt mildly affected by my medicated
pizza, which was also very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little CBD Renee dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get some of that CBD Renee?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I said I wanted to wait until I was a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_07]: So very cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was actually just off of the back,
zooming in with the camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want the CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want the CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, you're doing whatever we
can make and it's like CBD Renee,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's getting us ripped.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a new, different way and hey,
you're going to see me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, I'm going to see your CBD
Renee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Carb action.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the nail's sitting a bit funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're doing that, I'm going to jump
into this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tasty treats.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hanging out with buddies at Mega Hill and
Mega Chill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medicated pizzas.
[SPEAKER_06]: D-nail bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bad CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one taste that could bring us all
to being sober at the end of the night if
[SPEAKER_01]: we kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that taste more than I like getting
high, if that's what it costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really nice taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just you never know what you're
going to get when you're crossing these
[SPEAKER_06]: strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that Matt's working on some other
interesting things right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll probably see in the near future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the next time I go visit House of
the Great Gardener, we'll catch up with
[SPEAKER_06]: him and see what's going on over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for now, I think I'm going to say Puff
Wednesday was killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We managed to puff a fair bit of bowls.
[SPEAKER_06]: We puffed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat a medicated pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get above the clouds for a weather
inversion.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't seen that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pumped into Horatio, who literally drove
an hour and a half to get here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We blazed with snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on the other side of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humans can detect that down to 0.24 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're programmed to find that smell if
it's the last thing they do on Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I learned that, I'm like,
holy shit, how the fuck am I going to ever
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to eat it like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just tasted the two waters.
[SPEAKER_06]: This water was very much like water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really florally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, floral water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Essence of water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Reminiscent of...
[SPEAKER_01]: Reminiscent of bubble water, but clear,
like literally clear water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the first thing I want to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, how far is this off in your
bubble water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is what I meant by you're not
going to get the turps back out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get the turps back out of this,
you're still going to end up with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an ever-ending loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what me and Tony agreed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get it out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you first said, could you get the
turps out of the bubble water?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, if there's floating oil from
broken heads, I can filter that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not getting this back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is when I looked at that machine,
and I'm like, we're getting too crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we just... I think that one day
we'll get it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the kind of thing... That's what
Kay was telling me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like... I feel like we have it
back, and you drank it, and you could have
[SPEAKER_01]: taken it after your hit, and it would have
been a natural... I know what you mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: to extract those flavors out of there,
and then get them into a purer form
[SPEAKER_01]: without the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have these flavors, which did these
flavors impregnate the water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are these separate flavors then...
[SPEAKER_01]: The original turp, because everything has,
in steam distillation, leaves the water as
[SPEAKER_01]: tainted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the steam rose, the steam orange,
the steam pine, that water is always
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know in that case, it's like a tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an imbued essence.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very tea-like.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one had a bite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why... Because when alcohol mixes
with water, it gets cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything comes out with that bite,
so everything looked like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I pulled this and this out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that a different kind of... I'm like,
that's just water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I get way less of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way, way less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty much in proportion.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should do that video.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the stuff people want to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it doesn't cost 15 grand to do,
which it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fractional distillation does not cost 15
grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is... Fractional distillation,
there's so many fractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fraction of what you pulled off
of through the pipe, which you exhale as a
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction, which you inhale as a fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it shouldn't be an intimidating term,
although it can become an intimidating
[SPEAKER_01]: apparatus.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go pretty deep with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like even these, these are terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these aren't pure terpene.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's many, many, many terpenes in here,
and then there's ways of exactly
[SPEAKER_06]: separating those all up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be really neat, because once we
could get those all separated... It's one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those mixed bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been separating them for ages,
but the used chemicals may not be in line
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and I've smelled the ones they've
used from plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just interested in doing it with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's... Excepting cannabis terpenes in
pure form, and then fractionally... Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is what I mean by, this is a fraction
of the floral essence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I go home and I have all the bud in
which there's a whole other fraction that
[SPEAKER_01]: could come out, because this is no
temperature process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one fraction, and then... It's
all about the process, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Say we one day come up with a process,
though, that allows us to pull 100% of the
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we then can take that and
literally, just like with bubble bags,
[SPEAKER_06]: separate it into all of its pure terpene
forms.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: To just have that little kit, crack it
open... That was what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, that's doable, but what would
be amazing if it was affordable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, that's the part that's not
affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the fact I'm here with this,
I'm like, even as I say this, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I did is a blessing of the privilege
I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people watching at home are like,
this isn't affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't doable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a luxury to be able to
re-combobulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like when we saw Tony get ahead of
that, I'm like, he's got a privilege that
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I get my privilege, it's mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the home user... Are you surprised
how many home users could see something
[SPEAKER_06]: and then be like, I'm going to come up
with something that does that very... Just
[SPEAKER_06]: to understand the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I absolutely know you can get a
percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not exactly terps and it's not
exactly oil floating on your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you get that broken head,
you got your turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It opened up that trichome head.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've got the released oil and
the turf, but they're at different
[SPEAKER_01]: densities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that mass is floating on the
water, it gets trapped within your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I can filter out that water,
that plant material, I'll eventually get
[SPEAKER_01]: back to water with oil floating on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's doable.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should show up one day, because man,
I'm telling you, people would love to see
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: To try the bubble water route,
all we need is... That was the first
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, dude, do you understand?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no bubble water to try this with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the many levels of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we get out of the bubble water
won't even be this, because it's from
[SPEAKER_06]: dried bud, but it will be more... Tony's
isn't from bubble water that I know of.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that he did some other thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was calling it whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of why I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Tony went the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went for the lost fraction, because I
wanted to see... No one smoked this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we introduced it to the pizza box?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we introduced it... Unfortunately,
I didn't get to do the sift from the bud I
[SPEAKER_01]: made this from in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on my 70s screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's waiting for that last two hours of
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got the text to come out in a mega
chill, because that was it, seeing what is
[SPEAKER_01]: even the sift like from the bud that
remains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it come out true to strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that means we could take that sift
and still run it through Tony's process
[SPEAKER_01]: and get a whole different... Lots of ways
to get fractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: True that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even when we're low temperature
dab, we're getting a fraction and missing
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you just see here by looking at
it, the different colors of all three
[SPEAKER_07]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the oil is more, you can see it's
more... It's bending like differently.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's bending like differently,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can already see just by looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have tasted all three.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the water was like a silver or four.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I found that the second one gave me
a numb feeling in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, because it's... My mouth went
all numb.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is cannabis alcohol, turkey.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I got that feeling.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know the effect I get from getting a
pure turpique, because you did give me
[SPEAKER_07]: that one drop on the first day,
which was... It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just that the flavor was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't as hard as what Tony gave
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only reason why is Tony just gave
me a lot more.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the first thing I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you can maybe do that with the
floral essence, but I wouldn't do that
[SPEAKER_01]: with thyme oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do that with mint oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do that with limonene oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: One drop isn't one drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of why I was like,
well, if it's the whole plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: one drop could be a totally long blowout
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is like the lady essence that us
men, as we smell it, this is what makes us
[SPEAKER_01]: girly and go into our gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so nothing, but it's burnt into your
memory more than something that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: loud and kill, because it's light and it's
lily light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps at Mega Chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I might go drive over somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey man, the world's yours when the cops
can be shut off with a power button.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some serious editing going on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm unarmed, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's a caddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, there's an audience in the corner,
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure there's some hash in the
mailbox.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, fucking A.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an R8.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you got a sweet ass car.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save it to disk, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take it home.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to smash this shit up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you hitting?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're smoking something.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's what I was, yeah, but then we
did a whole, no, no, no, no, on camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got my light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mega Chill medical cannabis menu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got some shatters in the top there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some butters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other shatters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got some medicated stone nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stone-utted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some tinctures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Motor bars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some candy.
Gummies.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little platinum.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks really nice, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's real darn nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to admit, I didn't think you were
going to pull something out quite as nice
[SPEAKER_05]: as that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be very careful only to touch the stocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did get a little talking to last time
when I did a little talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is the Rock, Platinum Rock MKU.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: East Coast Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coma.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sandman Coma.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bubba Death Rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: PK Ripper.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Klondike.
[SPEAKER_06]: The RMK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: The Rumpelstiltskin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes, the Rumpelstiltskin.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to get you some more hashes in
here, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see your Afghan press hash, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cubo hash there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much for the medicated sativa gummies?
[SPEAKER_02]: $7.
[SPEAKER_06]: For a bag?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much is in each one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, dosage wise, I think approximately
$100.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, thanks Matt and the good folks
here at Mega Ill and Mega Chill for
[SPEAKER_06]: showing us the hospitality.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I think we're just going to
continue puffing bowls.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll end Puff Wednesday for now and
say thanks for watching.
See you next time.
