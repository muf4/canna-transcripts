[SPEAKER_03]: Hey good morning guys it is the next day
here in Mallorca.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just woke up in a beautiful apartment
that was supplied to us by Danny and Grace
[SPEAKER_03]: our most amazing hosts who took such good
care of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: How good did they take care of us last
night?
[SPEAKER_03]: The best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got this little apartment here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the little town hall across the
street there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The police station right across the street
and there's the little town right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna probably take a walk down to
the beach which is apparently only a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple blocks from our little apartment
here right now so yeah we're gonna make a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of hash today and do a little
bit of rosin as well we got to go help
[SPEAKER_03]: Danny and grab the rosin press apparently
it weighs damn near a ton and he can't do
[SPEAKER_03]: it by himself so we're happy to go and
help him do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime I think we're gonna take a
little walk down to the beach and have a
[SPEAKER_03]: little session on the beach so why don't
you guys join us.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna go do this?

myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah there's a coffee shop on the
corner there you guys want to go to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Casa Manolo or right here?

Enjoying Mallorca.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright so off to get some motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or look at motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look and ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright so apparently there's a motorcycle
place just around the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our friend's club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right in front of us here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This building here is the club.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it called?
[SPEAKER_03]: Edificti solvent.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the main street down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grace was telling us last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: John and I are walking right down the
street for no particular reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well you know what why not look like what
we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no room on the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sidewalks are all small and tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect we'll get you a La Barra.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cucina Mallorquina.
[SPEAKER_03]: El Posito.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of thought we were almost there
already but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah maybe we uh.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think we took the wrong street?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of should be straight in front of us.
A
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of this long walking stuff I'm going
to speed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: A snap toy store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Birthday party store.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little space for this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's this way either to the left
or to the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping it straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Straight it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even just
[SPEAKER_03]: these garage doors they're just so
different from what we're used to.
[SPEAKER_04]: They understood something here that we
didn't understand in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing like that new union stuff lasts much
longer than just keep redoing and like
[SPEAKER_04]: fixing spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then do it with exactly the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much scooters?
[SPEAKER_06]: Three scooters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two scooters.
[SPEAKER_02]: See a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow he's got a whole stack of
motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the BMW.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh the Honda.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the BMW oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two Hondas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the seat on the Honda.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's comfy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh right I saw that it came with two
helmets.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ours are numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a five and a six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Motorcycle and car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yours is a class five?
[SPEAKER_03]: Class five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is the equivalent of what two or
something?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a regular license that you can
buy in different cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is not for big motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: No exactly it's just for smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big trade from my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Them selling out all price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question was raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the legalized rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the medicine of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the medicine of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintaining the balance with pleasure and
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sick and feel tired as life goes out the
drain.
We'll get to where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sustaining, melting, living, sipping clean
food and clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to where you are.
