[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just doing a little photography,
macro photography here in Remo's room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful UBC chemo kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll be sharing these photos in the
near near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is absolutely covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a whole row of them here
behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna shoot that and then we're gonna
head on over and we're going to shoot the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue cheese, which is over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the blue cheese here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Covered in resin completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about the rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to photograph the rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another real beautiful strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bongburu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, last but certainly not
least, we're going to talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: kosher kush from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing looks like Girl Scout cookies,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, and I better not forget Karma
Genetics, the beast back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this is the white OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this thing is pretty ridiculous as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're going to have fun
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a room full of monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I'm the happiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm going to get back to macro
shooting so I can share the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you soon on Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
