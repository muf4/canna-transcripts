[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Bubble Man here with John Berfellow
from MedTainer Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are out on the beautiful Howe Sound and
we're going to today... We're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make some bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make some bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a lot of bubble over the years
and I've done it all over the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've never made bubble on a boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made it on a bus with DJ Short and
Mark Emery driving around the city of
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun at the 2004 Tokers Bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made it on the side of mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made it in jungles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made it really all over the place,
but we've never done it on the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about this for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the beautiful Sunshine Coast
behind us where Pott TV was based out of
[SPEAKER_00]: in its earlier days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Whistler up north, Anvil Island
behind us along with Gambier and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Elphinstone Mountain behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really just a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figured let's make a little YouTube
video and maybe get some tips out there to
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that haven't really learned the
proper methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say techniques because
everyone wants to make it their own
[SPEAKER_00]: technique, but really it's a simple
instruction for doing this process and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you follow those simple instructions and
you use exceptional material like what
[SPEAKER_00]: John has brought us here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have we got here, John?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about the Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medi Kush is a strain that works very well
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came to me back in 2006 after I had an
accident and it worked very well for
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was from seed and over the years I
named it Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works so well for medicine and I
entered into a cannabis cup in 2011 at TY
[SPEAKER_03]: Treating Yourself and I won first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing medical cannabis for the medical
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really good for pain and spasms I'm gonna
guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: High THC, high CBD, very low CBN and as
you know the triclone development which
[SPEAKER_03]: we've done with dry sifting in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is amazing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exceptional, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking about making bubble for
how long?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too long?
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably November since the cannabis
cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course I brought the finest and this
is not, this isn't, this is... So you know
[SPEAKER_00]: just to go back a little bit, when John
says he's growing his own medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: John had a pretty terrible accident back
in... 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2005, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John, I mean I'll let him tell you in a
quick three, four minute clip of what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened to him so you understand that
when he says he's growing his medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: he's not talking about like the odd
headache here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a serious accident that this man
went through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, tell them a little bit about your
accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, back in 2005 went to work one
morning bright and early, sunny out like
[SPEAKER_03]: it is today and really excited to get to
work because that's what I am,
[SPEAKER_03]: a hard worker and I load up a scissor lift
and made a wrong step and fell 28 feet on
[SPEAKER_03]: the concrete and broke my neck in four
places, shed my arm in 15 and it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: rebuilt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got plates in my neck, I got metal in
my back, I shattered my ankle and got some
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty major injuries and using
recreational cannabis started using
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful Brownies actually at BC
Compassionate Club Society.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent!
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going, WCU was paying for cabs for
me to go there three times a week to buy
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful Brownies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's made by Dr. Hornby and Paul and
there's some all about decarboxylating and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's where I started finding out how
cannabis works so well for medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helped with my spasms tremendously and
over the years I've been published on it,
[SPEAKER_03]: won awards on growing for cannabis and
being published on standardized medical
[SPEAKER_03]: grows, educating about medicine and one
more step was actually trichomes which you
[SPEAKER_03]: showed me over the last little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, trichome extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to properly use that medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this is definitely beautiful herb,
no joke, this is really nice herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you man, that's like, respect man,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone that, well it just looks perfect,
popcorn, nuggets, dense, covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to turn this into hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to bubble this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh look at the BC Ferry behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to take that over when we were
filming these videos back in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: days in Mark Emory's basement at the Pott
TV headquarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was I guess located in Roberts Creek
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alright, to take you back to where
we're at right now is we're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, we've got an eight bag,
five gallon kit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see these are the bags for those
of you that have never used this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are five gallon bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fit inside a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside one, the purple one here has a
25 micron screen and then within that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a white bag with a 45 screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a yellow bag with a 73 micron
into the black which is 90, one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange 120 and then we're going to
continue to stack the bags for you guys on
[SPEAKER_00]: camera while we just sort of chat away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure John's going to have a trippy
stick here soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to have one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those days out on the boat,
the sublimator or the big bong with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter in the beeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just becomes more of a pain in the butt
than it's really worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trippy stick just makes it so easy for
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medicine on the go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to give props to Emilio for
really getting that cartridge out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trippy stick was for me what finally made
me like these pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was cartridge only pens I wasn't
really a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you were getting some like I was
saying bong size rips out of your trippy
[SPEAKER_00]: stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the 220 bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though if you want to grab the bubble
now bag we're going to use the bubble now
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least try the inverter on the boat
isn't really as strong enough to run the
[SPEAKER_00]: 130 watt motor as we thought it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the 220 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our cannabis and ice is going to go
inside here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to fill this up with
water, top it up, fill this up with like
[SPEAKER_00]: packet full of ice and then we'll mix it
for about maybe five, ten minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: By no means will we throw the herb away
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll still be resin left on it but I'm
pretty efficient in my extraction ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: so most likely he'll be able to just soak
it in coconut oil and make some nice
[SPEAKER_00]: medibles with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With what's left over right so we'll make
that happen with the 220 in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful evening for doing making bubble
I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been kind of trying to get it done
all day and the whole day just happened as
[SPEAKER_00]: days happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pushed back, pushed back, pushed back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'm pretty excited about this
timeline that we've got going on so I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess what I'll do is get John to put his
Medi-Cushion there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 150 grams or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful popcorn nug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want to show them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll get a little closer here and
we'll just show you guys what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: material we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the camera's not going to sort of
fix itself but yeah let's see if we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to be too rough with it
because you want to make sure that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't start falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin doesn't start falling out of the
220 on screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to close this.
Alright
[SPEAKER_00]: so I would usually make my own ice but
today it was kind of a do what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of day and we ended up buying ice
just from one of the local marinas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stereo just started making sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn that off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all of a sudden I heard like
weird news.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I heard something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bringing me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd still put more ice in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many would kind of think I'm insane but
the more ice that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it's you know not the best ice so
apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to crack this open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still a good chunk right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you fill it right up to the top with
ice is what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to fill it up to the top with ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh you know what you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're saying is fill it up to the
top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I mean you might fill it right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get enough of that ice in there
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want as much ice in there as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get this zipped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have ties that go through the
zipper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that's a smart thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you know the zipper has been known to
open up in the mixing motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just close it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I designed this bag as a barrel shaped bag
so it would kind of fit nice into the
[SPEAKER_00]: machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get the water in here you'll see
the ice will melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make a bunch of room for that herb
to start moving around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walking down to the dock coming in with
the cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell it on the other side of this
island right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open up the back of the truck and
everybody looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get this kind of mixed up
mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got beautiful clear water in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we did test this a little bit earlier
and we're not going to get the full power
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I would turn this on
generally for maybe three to six minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always run it for as long as you
want afterwards if you want to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: another mix if you want to beat it hard or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll do like a six minute mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll turn that up to six minutes and
we'll see if it's going to have the power
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually spin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is no problem because we're going to
spin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to help it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey so bubble man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inverter wasn't working for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here comes some waves crashing around
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing is we're doing the old
school redneck method.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the ore and we're mixing the
medicine up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could see how, what color is that
water right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God it's like golden beige.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right well we've done our mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a beautiful color water here in
the bubble now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the eight bag five gallon bubble
bag kit sitting in this nice little cubed
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually use a bucket but this is kind of
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm digging it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it because we can see the colors
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to drain that in there Johnny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble now has a nice gravity feed drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just lift it up off the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dump it into the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the color of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I wish you could see the color of
this boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh that's nice.
That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right so common misconception is that
you have to have the water all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is not even a third in here
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because there was so much ice and
material in here which we're just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave in there and bring up to the house
later for another run because well I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have the bubble now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it to turn on and actually work and
because we didn't have the inverter and it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't able to work I had to hand mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we're going to get top quality
but I bet you there's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: resin left in those in those nuggets so
we'll be running that again later.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point one thing I suggest to
people is to not leave the water and the
[SPEAKER_00]: resin combined for longer than you need
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to just kind of get rid of the
things you don't need and get those bags
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to lift up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 220 bag so it's not really
something that I would normally collect
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would call a smokable product out
of but it's a big enough bag that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to catch something for certain and
especially when you're using you know
[SPEAKER_00]: nuggets like that we can slide this over
right to here then I don't have to I can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually put it up here for if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little I don't know maybe a half
a gram of some type of what I would call
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly contaminant but what I would never
tell a customer to throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it for baking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all usable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always medicine available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be some little headies in
there not many but some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point I do have to bring this
forward a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a nice clean water that I can
flip the bags inside out on and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: clean of all the resin that's on them
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty important thing to do with
your bags if you want them to last.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't care that if they don't last
for 10 years then you don't have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this and they'll just work less and less
properly for you and yeah I usually just
[SPEAKER_00]: do that and then hang the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get that up here for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just hang that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the 220 bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up we have the green bag which is the
190.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also really a bag that I use to separate
out contaminant from the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble but lo and behold not surprised
this looks pretty darn blonde and
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a huge amount there but definitely a
nice little ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just drop that right on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah that's sugary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well look at that.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a ton but look at the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah look at the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purity will be what I would say is
99% hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally I don't take the 190 and wash
the dirty spoon into the 160.
[SPEAKER_00]: However this is exceptional looking resin
so I'll clean that in there and I will do
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing with the bottom screen from
one screen to the next so we don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose that resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now because this is resin soaked water
I'll still make my way over to my fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: water and rinse that bag really nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll actually take this bucket of water
and run it later through the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no resin is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right 220, 190.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up the red bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 160.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bumpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit bigger maybe twice the size
of the last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not quite twice the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never overly excited to see large
amounts in these bags so this you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: yield like that doesn't disappoint me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right so we washed our spoon in our
120 and then we're gonna do the same with
[SPEAKER_00]: our 160 bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip it inside out the best you can
without getting resin all over the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a quick shaky rinse just real quick and
then back over to our fresh water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we can really clean off.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bags will last you 10 plus years if
you just take care of them and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: sad to see how many people don't take care
of their bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside out and ready to hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're getting into the good bags John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got a 120, a 90, 73,
a 45 and a 25 left so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like the 73?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm partial from the 120 all the way down
to the 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is much slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get a much nicer little blonde
color on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it'll be like for
amounts but this the purity on this is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be beautiful and we'll make a point
on taking some some nice photos so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's darn near perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just and that's 120 so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Camera's probably not auto focusing for
you people at home which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to take this home and get a
few pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's twice as much as last time now
maybe three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bubble's real deceiving you know
sometimes you think oh I got so little but
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect we'll get a nice return because
it was such nice material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So continuing to wash each bag very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse them, turn them inside out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop every once in a while for a trippy
stick hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: See the bone dryness of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that is some bone dry herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh look at the slow water on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow water is always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Means there's something blocking the
screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my favorite by far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite as much as the 120 but how about
that for a color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be really exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't expecting to get a big one out of
that anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push them back a little bit so they're not
touching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I like to have them all together to
show everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll go right back into this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah we're gonna wash it into the 73.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just get that washed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're saving monster hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too valuable not to be saving it
on all levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right Johnny's favorite coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah yeah it's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm watching it from this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting blonder and blonder and
blonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah very good very good very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back into the 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on the 45?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you know what a lot of people have a
lot of different things to say about the
[SPEAKER_00]: 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 45 is a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let hash snobs know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you they don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I tell them the 45 is the 73 or the
90 they love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about it that it's
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just immature head.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some thing going on in the 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely oily so there's a high
terpene content in the 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost always.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really almost the most accurate
generalization about bubble bags and water
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction that you can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah I mean it's it's always a good
pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably be the biggest pull right
now when we pull this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually on the side there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be a nice little pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god is it creamy and really really
nice looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how it's all foamy in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the foam.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've actually never made bubble from
any fish before so I've never thought of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm just gonna make sure that we have
all the proper room that we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bubble is such high quality that
there's absolutely no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's already drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah are you sure?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to let it sit here for much
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a beautiful 45.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's even cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to the 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gave some to a friend as a as a
gift a small amount and he at first just
[SPEAKER_00]: thought oh he's just giving me stuff he
doesn't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went home and he had a little smoke
on it and basically couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just like whoa what was that that
you gave me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah there's nothing wrong with 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you're giving you know the
190 away or the 220 there that looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: just absolute pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's a bag that causes a lot of
people problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the screen is so tight it holds
the majority of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: A real easy process for draining this bag
is the quick lift and then release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lift and release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lift and release.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's lifting the resin up off of the
bottom of the screen and it's allowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: water to wash through the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people if you let this bag
just drip it'll eventually almost stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had people leave it on their you know
the bathroom doorknob and 32 hours later
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still dripping into the into the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely a good idea to help this one
along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never really stuck my head in there
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man it's awesome because it's cold and
fresh and nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'll put this down in the towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This towel is going to absorb a lot of
that water that's still in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All just really nice looking resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: No complaints on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: One two three four five six eight
different colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blatantly you can see such the difference
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the bubbles in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks like the moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people see that they don't really
know like often mistake that for the
[SPEAKER_01]: honeycomb oil that you know basically has
been purged out and then creates those
[SPEAKER_01]: honeycombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just water purging out and turning
into a nice honeycomb bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we're not going to leave this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is extremely wet bubble and we're
we're still going to break this bubble up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be doing it on the
boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided when we get back to the house
we'll show you how we process the final
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of resin into a powder and how we get
it dry after that because that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important process and it's once
again something that a lot of people get
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of bubble as you can see goes
a long long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we just made a batch of bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 10 grams or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was easily 10 percent that
was able to return.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have probably gotten 15 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is only 10 grams there or
eight or whatever it just means that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's eight more sitting in the bag for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers from British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we'll see you at the Kush Cup in
the Health Expo in Vancouver on what is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the 26th 27th and 28th or 28th 29th
30th 28th 29th and 30th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Kush Cup happening as well as the
Health Expo in Vancouver so you can check
[SPEAKER_00]: out Kush.ca for information on that or you
can punch in Health Expo Vancouver 2013
[SPEAKER_00]: into Google and find out a little bit of
information about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have a booth at both places
so please come see me if you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: John will probably be happening there as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely be having a MedTener
Canada booth there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah you know I've actually finally ran
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes divine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow is that nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Canada tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait until we smoke the hash John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait until we smoke the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're done with that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a couple of sips and we're just
going to give it back to Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more resin in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've run it all through the screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah let's get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming on up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa those fish look ripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we hope to see you all again real
soon and please leave some comments or

[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Bubbleman here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finished making that batch out on the
boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit too windy to think of
breaking the bubble up so what we did was
[SPEAKER_00]: we very lightly dabbed it in the pressing
screens which come in the bubble bag kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get three in a five gallon kit and
this is basically too gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take the bubble out of the bags we
place it inside the pressing screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like to do it in a nice row so I
can see all my kinds and then I merely
[SPEAKER_00]: have towel underneath and towel over top
and I gently dab the water out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now depending on the quality of the bubble
you'll want to leave more water present
[SPEAKER_00]: for a quality of resin that is extremely
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That resin will self press and bond and
trap moisture in the resin and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's why a lot of the people are using
this microplaning technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that if you've over pressed or over
dabbed or allowed the resin to self press
[SPEAKER_00]: in any way which we obviously did because
we were out on the boat we had to leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the moist patty and then we brought it
up and I just froze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That resin is at this point not going to
work through the strainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually use a little bit larger of a
strainer than this with even larger holes
[SPEAKER_00]: and with a spoon I place the patty in
there and I gently push it through and it
[SPEAKER_00]: basically falls out as a perfect powder as
long as I let it fall very thinly spread
[SPEAKER_00]: on the cardboard because let's keep in
mind there's a lot of moisture in this
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely soaking wet and the real
plan is to get it out in the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: possible without affecting the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a variety of schools of thought
on this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one of the old schoolers that just
break it up into powder through the
[SPEAKER_00]: strainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no grinding involved so the heads
are completely intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I can't say that the heads aren't
in contact when you grind frozen resin but
[SPEAKER_00]: well we'll photograph this resin once
we've once we've dried it out I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: photograph it with my macro lens and I'll
see if there's any difference than the
[SPEAKER_00]: resin I look at that's through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonetheless they both work they both do
the job what they're doing is they're
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking up the bubble into a really nice
spread thin surface area which then allows
[SPEAKER_00]: the bubble to properly dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now maybe down in California and Arizona
you can dry bubble properly like that on
[SPEAKER_00]: wax paper or on parchment paper that
they're using but I prefer for the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world especially places where there's
more moisture content is high in the air
[SPEAKER_00]: that you use a desiccant and I just use
cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is no special cardboard it's just a
double thick corrugated cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food grade so that it's not soaked in
chemicals and basically this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: cardboard I use and the cardboard acts as
a desiccant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pulls the moisture out of the wet
bubble rather than thinking that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: air dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just for years dried my bubble
improperly and couldn't believe how
[SPEAKER_00]: actually difficult it was to get bubble to
properly dry so I'm not saying one's
[SPEAKER_00]: better than the other if you use the micro
planer and and you're getting your bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and it's you know you're a connoisseur
and you know the quality then that's great
[SPEAKER_00]: and otherwise the strainer works really
good as well and in fact I have the fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble from yesterday that we ran on the
boat and so let's see for instance here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the 190 quality just run that real quick
through the through the micro plane and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll fall on the cardboard is a nice
powder definitely working good but it
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely feels like it's grinding up I'm
used to just pushing it through so this
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble is nice and frozen I've got it in
the cooler here and it's amazing that this
[SPEAKER_00]: 190 actually looks to be a decent quality
because it will it just never is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by decent I say absolute crap for a
connoisseur but still something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually smokable by by most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that broke it up into a nice powder I
would say that normally because I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: doing filming here alone I would normally
use much more cardboard even for a small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of bubble like this I would usually
probably spread it throughout this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: section but I'm gonna want to show you the
grinding of all the different grades the
[SPEAKER_00]: micro planing and so I figured that's a
real nice white rock that's the 160 just
[SPEAKER_00]: run that through there really nice color
pretty much white
[SPEAKER_00]: micro planer cleans quite nice I think the
fact that the resin is frozen is key
[SPEAKER_00]: because yeah it cleans off real nice even
for a high quality resin you give it one
[SPEAKER_00]: good whack and it's almost 90% clear of
any of any resin left on there so we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just make sure this 190 is far away from
our 120 so we got 190 160 that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: a mistake that first one was from the 220
bag that's what happened 220 190 and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll put the 160 right here the 160 looks
even better than the 190 did really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: white rock of bubble and that of course is
due to the fact that we frozen almost
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately and when you freeze it well
you're not getting any more degradation
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not getting any oxidization you're
not getting any light put it in there in a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice dark container and this is absolutely
blonde bubble is very frozen very frozen
[SPEAKER_00]: all right so that's a real nice color
can't wait to get that under the lens
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's enough moisture content in
the bubble and it's so sticky that even
[SPEAKER_00]: with a little bit of wind that I'm getting
back here right now I'm not overly worried
[SPEAKER_00]: about it we've had a couple of good wind
gusts and once the resin hits the
[SPEAKER_00]: cardboard it's basically it's not gonna
come off until it's dry now and because
[SPEAKER_00]: we've broken it up into a nice powder it
will come off the cardboard nicely I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: show you when it's dried as long as I
don't put it in some heated space it
[SPEAKER_00]: should come off the cardboard just
beautifully so now we've got the 120 with
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot of room to dry it we're probably
gonna end up taking some of the 90 space
[SPEAKER_00]: up this 120 is really nice just
[SPEAKER_00]: white in color I might make be making some
of you laugh out there I don't know I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not a micro planer I've never really I
mean I've done this a handful of times
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously but not to the point where I've
gotten comfortable and come up with my own
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques with it I'm pretty comfortable
with the strainer that's how I like to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it all right so that 120 literally took up
the rest of the cardboard so we'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch out the rest of those and we'll
move on to the next one I've got obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: the 90 the 73 the 45 and the 25 and I'll
basically be doing the same process over
[SPEAKER_00]: the cardboard and I'll get photos of the
whole microscopic process of what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on the resin definitely looks as though
it's been shredded to me but we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: with the macro lens in just a little while
here thanks for joining us give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick show of this resin you can see the
one in the bottom corner there that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual 220 we used a 220 bag in the bubble
now but a little bit of contaminant got
[SPEAKER_00]: through in the tiniest little bit of resin
is actually in there and then the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: it is basically almost so blonde that you
can't even see it on the cardboard but I
[SPEAKER_00]: assure you there's a fair bit there all
right so this is the last one the 25 this
[SPEAKER_00]: one's the 45 and a quick little micro
plane later this bubble is really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: color blonde
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely not on my micro playing game
here a little bit of a bit of bumps always
[SPEAKER_00]: running out of cardboard as almost every
bubble head does when you're using this
[SPEAKER_00]: method all right that's some beautiful 25
micron Wow put it on my fingers it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get sticky great-looking
bubble
