[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's World,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I would share a 420 rip with all
of you, as it is 418 here, a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes and counting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, let's have a 420 session with
the Bubble Man's World audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are growing every day and it's
really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met some really great people through
YouTube and the channel, live chats in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, the hash churches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always happy to see you guys coming in and
dropping in for a little visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's just for a quick bowl or to
listen to some of the things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got about a minute, so I guess I'll
jive with you here before I take this
[SPEAKER_00]: little guy down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of fresh frozen Astro
Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might actually be 45 microns,
but I'll have to hit it to let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up to 420 here, I've got my quartz
crystal carb cap that I'll have on
[SPEAKER_00]: standby.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nails are all heated up, a little bit
dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could use a nice wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll do that tonight and throw in
the grunge off and get it nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow's 420 and I'll have the pipe much
cleaner for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so grab your joints,
grab your pipes, grab whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free that if 420 has just passed you
by and this video is uploaded,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you still join me for a puff,
regardless of whether it's truly 420 or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go, 420 on the clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, wonderful 420 rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time on Bubble Man's
World.
