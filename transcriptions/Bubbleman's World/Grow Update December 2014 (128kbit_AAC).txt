[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and welcome to my little tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys may have forgotten, but I do
still have a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although my mothers definitely took a
major hit when I went away for almost a
[SPEAKER_00]: month there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the majority of them still going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that I did lose, which was
only a few of them, I had given them away
[SPEAKER_00]: so many times that there's not even a
worry of getting them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, already John here has given
me three new plants to go into bigger pots
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got D420K who I gave all the
cuts to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and his buddy are going to be cutting
me just a couple of each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's helpful that way because I'm not
really in a position to be holding 35 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to give them away to enough
people that they are all secure in
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I consider secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I just really wanted to do a
tiny little video with you guys on,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, some transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Johnny B has been so kind to bring me
back two of my great gardener favorites,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the Barb, Barbara Budd,
as well as his Afghani, which we now will
[SPEAKER_00]: call the GG1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, it's been worked by him quite
a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's crossed it here and there and he's
changed the phenos and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done some breeding with it over the
last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he really considers it more of a GG1,
a great gardener one than just your
[SPEAKER_00]: standard Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, last but not least,
we've got our old favorite, the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apollo 13 male pollen smacked to an
Ortega crossed with a C99.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, it was in a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an accident making this plant,
but I'm really glad they made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best things come from
accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't you guys agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we'll get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll bring this guy forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, Barbara tippage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys caught that, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you off camera here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really quite simply put, oh,
he's got multiple Barb stickers on this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't make a mistake that way,
can you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Barb is definitely not the
healthiest of the three, but it is still
[SPEAKER_00]: got a few roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very many at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better make sure that we
[SPEAKER_00]: get a nice cube of dirt out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to come in handy for the
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little dirt out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to be somewhat meticulous,
even though really the easiest way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this is to be able to get dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just drop that in there and fill her
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of break off the sides that have the
of that particular pot that we're barely
[SPEAKER_00]: holding together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want, you can kind of go
around the rest of the pot and fill up
[SPEAKER_00]: that earth, that non-earth, I guess,
that soilless mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One little clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like to just pat it down the
tiniest bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also why I leave a good inch out
of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you, when I fill them up,
you can see this one here has almost a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a full inch of space between the top and
the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do that so that when I add that
extra little bit of earth or soilless,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the room to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really love to get myself going in
a more professional grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really is just a home sort of unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do it this way to try and show
people that you can grow on a small level
[SPEAKER_00]: and still produce enough resin for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie to produce one gram
of full melt resin for every single day of
[SPEAKER_00]: your existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: 365 grams, almost a pound, three quarters
of a pound of resin per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 365 days to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a couple of tents, I'm going to
show you how you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really my whole purpose on
sharing my garden is so that you guys can
[SPEAKER_00]: learn some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: By no means do I consider myself a grow
expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really the ideal person to ask if
your leaves are curling or if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of bug or that sort of,
I've got little tips when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but I'm really not an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning all along with the rest of
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always encourage people to join a
good grow forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: InternationalCantograph.com was pretty
good when I was still around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's still got some good people
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's best to post in a forum like that
and you get so many people who see it and
[SPEAKER_00]: these people that really just can't help
but share their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the first ones to offer you great
advice and those grow forums are the best
[SPEAKER_00]: place to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see if we can't pull out a cube
of dirt from this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put him over there for a sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring this guy over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Afghani, the GG-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you, the GG-1, what it
really reminds me of more than anything is
[SPEAKER_00]: the old school Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this one's got some, oh, just about
had a nightmare there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got some roots sticking out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, these are really freshly rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to thank John for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big root tap root coming out there,
but they haven't quite, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really started pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect in the next couple of days of
these guys being transplanted,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to see a really nice growth
spurt come out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll try to just release that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so much for my idea of keeping the
grow area clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can't really see, but I spilt a
little bit on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the Afghani and the Barb
transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was showing you the
transplanting on the watermelon,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I guess my video camera turned off
when I grabbed the camera to show you the
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of spillage that I did here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the watermelon transplanted perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the healthiest of the three clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could have had it on video
because I showed you the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually had a nice formation of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so many, but definitely a few where
I'm definitely confident that this one's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to stand up and stay, stay tall and
stay strong for the transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that I get a bit of droop on
these guys, but we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the start of another little
crop right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Barb Afghani and watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's small little plants right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what I'll do is probably
acquire another seven or so cuts from
[SPEAKER_00]: friends around the same size and I'll grow
them all together as a 10, 10 plant crop
[SPEAKER_00]: under my, uh, under my eight foot tent
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got the other tent right now is
filled with the mothers that I'm bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: back to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll show you a little bit of that in
the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, keep on growing that
cannabis guys, because, uh, we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed our endocannabinoid systems and it's
not always possible to pay the big
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep watching bubble man's world and we
will talk to you soon.
Thanks for watching.
