[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Hash Church 2.0,
episode 1, the past, the present,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the future of Hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty, pretty excited to have
everyone here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, and how lucky did I get?
[SPEAKER_02]: My YouTube was on mute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally dropped the ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have heard myself reverberating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm going to send the invite out
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a really cool panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some of the regulars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some new folks, and we're going to
be discussing Hashish today from start to
[SPEAKER_02]: finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to let the conversation sway
into anything other than that beautiful,
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful glandular trichome heads that we
oh so love.
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular, microencapsulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, let me get the link out here to
everyone right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got myself a new way of doing it,
so I don't have to send it through
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook to make sure we hear that right
swoosh sound, which we didn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I'll go to the other server.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we hearing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the swoosh?
[SPEAKER_02]: The swoosh!
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone should have gotten that link
now, and it's okay if you're a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: hazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could potentially make this a little bit
darker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Webcam settings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Webcam settings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I've got a good group invited in
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to have a discussion about
Hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a long time coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B., number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better punch these in.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Jessica and Andrew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a little bit of room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a little bit of room.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone that hasn't opened has to close it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has to close it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear my own voice coming through the
headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, it's the Dobis family.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got to figure out your
microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just reverberating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have to leave it on mute when
you're not talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Hash Church 2.0, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some Frenchy cannoli in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: in the room, and we got Mr. Chris Bennett
in the room, hitting his vape bag already
[SPEAKER_02]: nice and early.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, Chris?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me, Chris?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't hear you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on, Drew?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear you perfectly, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You came in with headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got 513 people that have been
waiting anxiously for Hash Church 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: You came in with headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Chris, if you have the YouTube
channel, if any of you have the YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: channel open, just mute it completely
because we don't want to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only want the panelists to be in the
Google chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like when you phone in on the
radio station, you got to turn the radio
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to make sure that you don't have any
feedback going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Mr. Skunkman Sam in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on, Skunkman?
[SPEAKER_10]: Howdy, howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Howdy, howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did she not get the link?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's try this again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great to see everybody this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to be seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for the technical difficulties,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want to get the room on point
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got seven people, so we got room for
three more Hash Warriors, and then we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: get things started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dablogic in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on, Dablogic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on point here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, not sure if you can hear me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually why I sent the etiquette
out three or four days early for us to try
[SPEAKER_02]: to check on everyone's cam and microphone
and whatnot, just in case.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not talking, just leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hear you, Dablogic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the YouTube channel is on your ...
You just have to close YouTube and only
[SPEAKER_02]: keep the Google chat open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you want to mute YouTube and keep
an eye on the chat that's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: DankDuchess, I just sent you the link
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that I got the right email for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just replied back to the email you sent
me, so it should absolutely be the right
[SPEAKER_02]: email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a little bit of technical
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: My cat wants the hashtag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he's right on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just like, all over it, like
fresh-made sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, get that going.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just jumped up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, okay, this is about hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about hash, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubbleman's OCD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of Hash Church, and I think it's
okay to have technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got nine folks in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Solomon with his mind just dropped
into the chat room.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on, buddy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on with you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it sounds like we're about to get
down and have a little conversation about
[SPEAKER_02]: hashish.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to start off with Mr.
Chris Bennett.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a little bit of a thing put
together, just a little overview,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever he wants to say, and then once
we've done that, we'll introduce each
[SPEAKER_02]: person and sort of a quick little who you
are, how long you've been involved with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, when you got involved with
hashish, and then we'll move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you get into the presence of
hashish after that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to see another season of Hash Church
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely, I've had a longstanding
interest in the history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of that has been about how it affects
culture via magic and religion and that
[SPEAKER_03]: type of stuff, so consciousness,
that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, in my quarter century of
looking into that, I've come across much
[SPEAKER_03]: on hashish and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't claim to be an expert in the
history like Robert C.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clark, but I'll go over some of the basic
kind of information about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much is unknown when it comes to hashish,
when we started separating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the earliest possible reference to
separating trichomes from the leaves and
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers is an Assyrian reference pointed
to by Ethan Russo from about 2600 years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in it, the instructions require that
16 drugs thou shall dry pound and strain
[SPEAKER_03]: and then fumigate with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're obviously straining it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, whether this was a full on separation
of, that's my bird in the background,
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's a full on separation of
trichomes from the leaves and flowers,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, could just be pulverized
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the earliest one we have to
like strain type of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also lots of references in the
ancient world to konabu incense,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a cannabis incense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many people have suggested that this
was a form of hashish as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some books printed as a form of
hashish in ancient Assyria.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unclear.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of ancient incense was simply ground
up plants mixed together, powdered,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you'd have to actually put oil on it
and stuff like that to be able to light
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not clear if it was a full on
resin extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there are references to oil of
konabu, which is oil of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this does sound like some sort of oil
product that has been extracted,
[SPEAKER_03]: although the extraction methods used to
attain this are unknown.
[SPEAKER_03]: In his book, the Rig Vedic Soma,
the Indian scholar Warrampad suggests that
[SPEAKER_03]: there are ancient Sanskrit names for
cannabis leaves, flowers, and resin,
[SPEAKER_03]: which seems to indicate that there would
have been a means of separating it from
[SPEAKER_03]: the flowers and stalks back then even.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Cheras is pretty old in Indian
literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may go back to Vedic references,
according to Warrampande.
[SPEAKER_03]: The turn hashish itself first starts to
appear in the Muslim world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's thought to be just mean the herb and
kind of like the herb in relation to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, like kind of the herb of herbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And although other suggestions have been
made, the 19th century biblical scholar
[SPEAKER_03]: John Keto suggested that hashish actually
came from a Hebrew word, ashisha,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was related to both a plant that
provided some sort of resin that was mixed
[SPEAKER_03]: with wine and shesh, a plant that was a
fiber plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have here a resinous and a fiber
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says that ashisha likely became
hashish as it carried on into the Islamic
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in India as well, like, you know,
a lot of people say that hashish didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: start until the Islamic world and cannabis
use even.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Persian use of cannabis was going on long
before Islamic use took place amongst the
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoroastrian religion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right up until the Islamic period,
we have Zoroastrian references to the
[SPEAKER_03]: terms manga and banga, which have been
suggested as cannabis and have also been
[SPEAKER_03]: suggested as hashish by some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the references to Keto,
this was a resin that was mixed with wine,
[SPEAKER_03]: according to some sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before hashish appears in the 10th
century in the Islamic world, there's
[SPEAKER_03]: another plant, dadi, which again is a
resin plant, intoxicating, but mixed with
[SPEAKER_03]: wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's important to remember that
a lot of the hashish in the medieval
[SPEAKER_03]: period was ingested or prepared with
drinks and not smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking cannabis and hashish is something
that's thought to be relatively new to
[SPEAKER_03]: take place after the time of discovery of
the new world habit of tobacco smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this was incorporated with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it was burnt as an incense,
this was generally in a fumigation type of
[SPEAKER_03]: situation where they would capture the
smoke and inhale it, but not have pipes
[SPEAKER_03]: and things like that to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although there's debate about this even,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then hashish, we start to see it
appearing in the medieval period.
[SPEAKER_03]: The alchemist Cardano makes a reference to
as-sisa, which is thought to be hashish
[SPEAKER_03]: from the description and other references
like that start to appear in the medieval
[SPEAKER_03]: period in Europe after the Crusades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the first European literature
novels and things like that actually make
[SPEAKER_03]: reference to hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marco Polo's famous escapades into the
Islamic world, which really led in a big
[SPEAKER_03]: way to the Crusades, as well as the
Decameron.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an account of the Decameron,
one of the first novels in Europe,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it also has a story of hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was pretty much taken up right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting that it appears in
fiction, because after Napoleon's war in
[SPEAKER_03]: the 18th century and invasion of the
Mideast, hashish became increasingly
[SPEAKER_03]: popular in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see this taking place particularly
among literary circles like that of Victor
[SPEAKER_03]: Hugo, Alexander Thumas, Theophile Gautier,
Balzac, Gerard de Nerval, and other
[SPEAKER_03]: writers who gathered together and approved
known as Le Club de Hashishines in Paris,
[SPEAKER_03]: France.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many of these authors, although they
wrote over 150 years ago, their books are
[SPEAKER_03]: still in print.
[SPEAKER_03]: Movies are made about their books.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are some of the best authors of the
world, and they all gathered together
[SPEAKER_03]: regularly to consume hashish, ingest it,
oftentimes a mixture of a gooey hashish
[SPEAKER_03]: into some coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they would take up more of a
psychedelic type of amount of dose,
[SPEAKER_03]: not the more casual social amount that
most of us are used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the really interesting things
about this period when hashish first
[SPEAKER_03]: starts to come up is some really
interesting psychological advancements
[SPEAKER_03]: started to take place.
[SPEAKER_03]: In both the 18th century, Dr. Thomas
Arnold, and in the 19th century,
[SPEAKER_03]: hashish club member and co-founder Dr. J
.J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moreau, they started to look at the
hashish intoxication and compare it to
[SPEAKER_03]: things like insanity, as well as the
ability to dream at night and are
[SPEAKER_03]: dreaming, because many people when they
were taking these larger amounts were
[SPEAKER_03]: having sort of astral type voyages and
coming back and telling tales of what they
[SPEAKER_03]: saw in these realms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this all led to the mapping out of
what became known as the subconscious and
[SPEAKER_03]: the unconscious mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hashish played a pivotal role in that
layout and understanding of that through
[SPEAKER_03]: psychiatrists and doctors like Dr. Thomas
Arnold and Dr. J.J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moreau.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a really important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's comparable to the role
that cannabinoids have played today in
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding the endocannabinoid system
in the body of man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is of equal importance because it
really led to our understanding of the
[SPEAKER_03]: human mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a pretty good overview
of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all sorts of different names.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could list off for five minutes probably
all the different names that hashish has
[SPEAKER_03]: acquired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like cannabis over the years, it's one of
the most named things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll save the audience that and open
it up to other talkers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bom Shiva.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bom Shiva.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great, Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for the breakdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see who we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure maybe Skunkman Sam has a few
things he wants to mention in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: the history of hashish or perhaps just in
regards to his history in hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say, Sam?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you there for a little chatty chat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did you leave the room to puff bowls?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I should say maybe that in the
Islamic world, a lot of it was filtered
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, a strained hash,
keep stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in India, a lot of that was
hand-pressed or skin-pressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the famous tale of the naked
virgins running through the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: fields and pressing cannabis plants all
over their bodies and skin and then
[SPEAKER_03]: scraping it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that could be mythology, but
definitely pressed together on hands and
[SPEAKER_03]: rubbed into little balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably the earliest way,
I would think, as opposed to separating
[SPEAKER_03]: Keith.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always felt like the running through
the fields and collecting hash on your
[SPEAKER_02]: body, although it was a beautiful vision,
it was probably more of a mythology than
[SPEAKER_02]: reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a lot of like romantic
imagination went into hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's all sorts of misinformation
out there in the historical record.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: People writing about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's second-hand accounts, third-hand
accounts, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I like that you finished it off with
a boom Shiva.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was, I will say, after
traveling to India and kind of linking up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at the Maha Kumbh Mela in
Haridwar where I went in 1998,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a very large gathering in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like a Lola Palooza of sadhus
where you have all the different sects are
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging out with, you know, with
themselves, the Nagas and the Krishnas and
[SPEAKER_02]: the Brahmas and the Shivites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went and hung out with the majority
of them and puffed bowls with the ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that would puff bowls and hung out and
drank teas with the ones that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: puff bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, if I didn't navigate and direct
myself right into the Shivite babas,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, where those guys the chillest sadhus
to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm talking, we hung out with the
Nagas who are, have apparently lived this
[SPEAKER_02]: intensely hard life and don't own clothes
or really anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they often get to bathe in the gaps
prior to, you know, a high ranking
[SPEAKER_02]: military and political officials.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have this sort of, you know,
they get to bathe first because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: life that they live, but hanging out and
puffing bowls with them was just not on
[SPEAKER_02]: the same level as hanging out and puffing
bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: With Pashupati, the Shivite baba that I
met on the banks of the Ganges and spent
[SPEAKER_02]: two to three weeks straight just smoking
chillum after chillum after chillum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can still hear him almost 20 years later
or 20 years actually later saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: one more chillum we are making,
one more chillum we are making.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just such a wonderful thing to hear
every seven to eight minutes for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 18 hours at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more chillum we are making.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah yes, one more chillum we are making.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that puts a smile on your face,
Frenchie, and as it should because smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: chillums is pretty darn fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want, before I smoked the
hubbly bubbly at the first Legends of Hash
[SPEAKER_02]: dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just throw Dutchess on mute there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounded like a vacuum got turned on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I smoked the hubbly bubbly from the
Afghans, I truly had never, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the chillum was the first like serious,
serious, serious pounding of hashish that
[SPEAKER_02]: my lungs had ever taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't that old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I was probably 25 or 26 years old
at the time and only really maybe 10 years
[SPEAKER_02]: into my journey as a hashishian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got into hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start why not with myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in probably 89, 90, I had been
smoking cannabis, but being from Winnipeg,
[SPEAKER_02]: we also saw some of the import hash that
came in via Montreal, which is where most
[SPEAKER_02]: of the hash in Canada was ex-imported
into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it was Moroccan, which we saw very
little of.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw a lot of Afghani and we saw the odd
brick of Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was able to, at a very young age,
experience the red Lebanese, which was a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more sedative and the white
Lebanese, which was a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: energetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess just the difference really was
cutting it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit earlier, or even maybe the
red lab sat on the field, probably more
[SPEAKER_02]: likely for a little bit longer of a time
and cured out that resin in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could also have been a different timeline
of summer to winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Sam or someone else on the panel has
an idea in regards to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else have some history of hashish
they want to share before we get into
[SPEAKER_02]: introducing ourselves and giving our own
history?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to show these antique chillums
I got here real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: With an old postcard from about 1910 of
Sadu, who's held his arm up until it's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually lost the ability to move out of
an act of devotion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are old 19th, early 20th century
fancy chillums that were used by Sadus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I met a guy at the Maha Kumba
Mela.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met a bunch of guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met a guy that was holding his arm up
and he had been holding it up for
[SPEAKER_02]: something like 31, or 32 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I met another guy who was kind of
propped up on this stand and he was
[SPEAKER_02]: holding his leg up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met a guy that had closed his fist and
grown his fingernails through the top of
[SPEAKER_02]: his hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just holding his fist closed for
like, I think he was like also over 20
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was a gentleman who had
stuck a knife right through his forearm
[SPEAKER_02]: and had a bucket collecting the blood that
was dripping down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was pretty sure that he was going
to be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a different sort of mentality,
the fakir mentality that removing the mind
[SPEAKER_02]: from the body, removing pain and the
existence of pain from the experience
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely tripped me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the things that I always
tell people, you know, India is like an
[SPEAKER_02]: adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really like a vacation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was kind of the main reason was
some of these guys at the Kumba Mela were
[SPEAKER_02]: just, they were doing some next level
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just a hash aficionado that wanted
to smoke some bowls with some sadhus on
[SPEAKER_02]: the side of the road and exchange
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got exposed to a lot more through
that, the culture of the Kumba Mela than I
[SPEAKER_02]: could have ever anticipated.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for sharing those chillums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that most of the chillums I
smoked while there in the nineties were of
[SPEAKER_02]: Italian creation, really smooth,
beautiful Italian chillums.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the sadhus kind of agreed that I met
at least that the Italian chillums were
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones that they wanted to be smoking
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why don't we go through the list?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with Dablogic and then we'll
move on to Jessica and Drew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll move on to the other Drew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll go through, I'll let you know
each time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want you guys to do is basically
give us Dablogic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a little history as to yourself
and to where you're at right now and how
[SPEAKER_02]: you got there in particular with Hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your inspirations?
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, everybody hear me?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I guess I got into Hashish from my
grandfather and introduced it to me first.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was big in the Hashish and Hashish oil
way back.
[SPEAKER_14]: And ever since then, I had a really big
interest in it and kind of devoted
[SPEAKER_14]: starting at like to researching Hashish
and learning about it and trying to,
[SPEAKER_14]: was the biggest, you know, kind of hurdle
for me was quality Hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: For a long enough time, I eventually met
some people and got good weed from it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And eventually that led into a,
which I passed, you know, or so.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Matt and I'm working with a company
Veride Natural.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all organic, all soil grown,
edicts and awesome things to work with.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and you're kind of going through all
their different, things and those
[SPEAKER_14]: different things and finding out what
works and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause that's kind of a, it's a big thing
with Hash as well is that can be let down
[SPEAKER_14]: on something you think is going to be
really amazing just because it's not the
[SPEAKER_14]: right lineage or the right variety that.
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give a timeline in regards to what
the year was when you were 15 and got
[SPEAKER_02]: turned on to Hash just to give us an idea?
[SPEAKER_14]: I am 25 right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I mean, that was about 10 years ago,
2008.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, bubble man was a huge part.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I've honestly, you know,
I've been watching your videos since I was
[SPEAKER_14]: young.
[SPEAKER_14]: So interesting thing to have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your photos have me drooling on the
regular dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you, you're, you're the growers and
the genetics and the hash making is
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: For dab logic, I'm always looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, all of you are on this panel for
almost that one main reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, a lot of you are well known,
but for me, it's as simple as does your
[SPEAKER_02]: photos of your hash make my mouth water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can't make that shit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can say that everyone on this panel
has hash that makes my mouth water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's really where the invitations
came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were like, well, how did you come
up with this panel?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, I came up with this panel
based on the fact that my mouth watered
[SPEAKER_02]: when I looked at their hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means to me that they took that
pathway of instead of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a really important thing that you
said, learning about the genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got very lucky when I started
the bubble bag company in 1999,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the first couple of materials I
made were just like, it's hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: hash, bubble hash in 1998, 99 was not
really something a lot of people loved.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were pressing it together,
wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were using genetics that weren't
really the ideal genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until I put some of Breeder
Steve Shishkeberry into my bags and
[SPEAKER_02]: actually saw something come out that was
full melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, I lucked out into
Renee, which was a beautiful cultivar that
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the first time I made hash with
it, I picked it up off of the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was swept into the corner with
dust and hair and dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I and I remember at first just picking
up a little bit because there was so much
[SPEAKER_02]: resin along the bottom in a rolling paper
just off the top that was undirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put it in the rolling paper and
rolled it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got home, I opened the paper up
and the hash was just in a tube and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: shiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, wow, that looks like it's
really nice resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked for all of the material off of
the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran a batch and basically got stained
glass window, beautiful, unbelievable
[SPEAKER_02]: Renee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Renee really was the whole reason why
Bubble Man as a character was able to in
[SPEAKER_02]: the early days inspire people such as
yourself, because that hash, that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: real magic for a hash maker, getting
either growing the proper material,
[SPEAKER_02]: which my hat's off to all of you that are
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also even those that are going around
and finding the material, it takes a real
[SPEAKER_02]: hashish aficionados olfactory to to remove
all of the bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like being a broker for
cannabis in the 90s in Vancouver and
[SPEAKER_02]: saying no to 90 percent of the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: That broker had the highest integrity and
that broker got the best contracts because
[SPEAKER_02]: the brokers that just wanted to make their
100 bucks on every pound and accepted
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that people showed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I hope you're getting the
metaphor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it was the wrong path to take,
which was the greed path.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with the hashish path, you know,
we're constantly running things and seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end, wow, this isn't really what I
wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't the resin that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hats off to the hash makers that,
you know, to the Rosen press with the
[SPEAKER_02]: subpar melts and to Frenchy's hands for
the full melt six stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's let's move on with Jessica and
Andrew, the beautiful young couple here
[SPEAKER_02]: who are expecting a child in the near
future and some hashish aficionados in the
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got their rosin press.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got their hash out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why don't you guys tell us a little
bit about yourselves?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I started I started seeing plants
when I was about 12.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what year that was.
[SPEAKER_09]: 2000, 2001, 2002.
[SPEAKER_09]: My uncle was growing up in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was around plants before I was making
hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was, you know, small time selling weed
and just smoking the flower up until about
[SPEAKER_09]: 18, 19, where I started to where I started
to grow for myself and making concentrates
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot more than the flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just started making hash and BHO.
[SPEAKER_09]: From there, we my one light turned into
four lights, four lights turned into 10
[SPEAKER_09]: lights and 10 lights turned into a job in
with some commercial grows in the Bay
[SPEAKER_09]: Area.
[SPEAKER_09]: And from there, I started taking in
material and making hash from that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had to hash in, let's say,
early 2011, 2012 wasn't as hyped as it was
[SPEAKER_09]: now.
[SPEAKER_09]: There wasn't a lot of people behind hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it was a lot of using using the BHO
money to make my own hash so I can smoke
[SPEAKER_09]: the hash and kind of, you know,
make money off the BHO.
[SPEAKER_09]: From there, we built the hash brand up
until I could afford to not make BHO
[SPEAKER_09]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I sold all my BHO equipment,
bought a condenser and refrigerator or
[SPEAKER_09]: refrigeration unit, set up a hash room.
[SPEAKER_09]: And from then on, it's just been hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's all we make now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we started from started from
growing four people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we have a permitted ranch up in
Calaveras County that we're growing our
[SPEAKER_09]: own material to make our own hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I met Jessica about three and a half years
ago and she joined the team and she's been
[SPEAKER_09]: a blessing ever since helping me with
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got introduced to hash and around 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that, how I learned about hash
was through Instagram, seeing it on
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles such as yourself and Mika T.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I found your YouTube channel,
Bubble Man, and I started watching your
[SPEAKER_00]: videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making hash, I believe,
with Sam, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was a great resource for me
and I was so intrigued.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a way to separate the
trichromes without using a chemical,
[SPEAKER_00]: just ice and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started reading forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I was a hash consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I met Andrew around 2014,
the end of 2014, early 2015.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you became a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she suited up in the cold room
and started making hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our story.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let me put you on mute real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It put a smile on my face to see the giant
bags of herb that are like sitting on the
[SPEAKER_02]: counter behind you guys right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, damn, these guys are like
seriously coming in with like 25,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hash maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat to hear that you got turned on
to it through Instagram, because wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was probably only four and a
half to five years ago, I broke my
[SPEAKER_02]: collarbone quite badly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sticking out very ugly, snowboarding
up in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was crippled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, couldn't move.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on my couch and I was very much onto
this sort of phone thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got onto Twitter within two or three
weeks of it coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram, I got on within the first
month, but it was a non-canon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mostly Asian people that were on
Instagram at the time, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: from Hong Kong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I couldn't even read what
they were saying, but it was a real
[SPEAKER_02]: photography app that was sharing
photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a photographer, I had a real
affinity and love for that and the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to kind of link up with people
from the other side of the world and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're shooting and getting ideas
and inspirations through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was being crippled on my back that I
finally picked up my iPad and I thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I have like 10, 10 years of
images, epic hash images, 10 years of
[SPEAKER_02]: images that I've been taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I compiled them all onto my iPad and I
just started posting like five or six of
[SPEAKER_02]: these images every day, you know,
probably for close to a year or six
[SPEAKER_02]: months, whatever it was, I think I posted
800 plus images in a very short period of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I built the BC bubble man
account on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I also was inspired, I mean,
solventless mind, your guys' self,
[SPEAKER_02]: dab logic, soil grown, Dr. Ladybug,
who I've invited in later, when we get a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of maybe in an hour and a bit,
we'll do a little switch and we'll get
[SPEAKER_02]: some new folks in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full blown inspiration to just be able to
look on your phone and see hash of the
[SPEAKER_02]: utmost highest quality, the six star,
where you just know, just by looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: it, there's not really any way to fake
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've had a real appreciation for
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat to hear about the past of
hashish and these authors meeting and
[SPEAKER_02]: eating hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now in the future you have,
well, which is now the present,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they call it a present because it
is indeed a gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have all of us sharing our information
and our photos and growing cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing genetics and just sharing tips and
tricks on in ways to get this product even
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaner and cleaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, one of my huge inspirations way
before Instagram existed and even way
[SPEAKER_02]: before Overgrow and sites like that was
Skunk Man Sam, even though he's very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very private man and he wasn't exactly
posting it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were on that underground scene,
if you went to the cannabis cup back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the early to mid 90s, you could maybe
cross paths with Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you'd see him speak at a large
cannabis and hemp conference and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: just be like, oh, wow, that's Skunk Man
Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there he is over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what a huge inspiration to be able to
finally meet him, become good friends with
[SPEAKER_02]: him, become beyond inspired from his
hashish processing, even at first just
[SPEAKER_02]: from photographing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that was a game changer when
the first 99.999% gland heads was
[SPEAKER_02]: photographed at his place in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was as effective as changing the way
people thought about hashish as the first
[SPEAKER_02]: water hash that was being shared with
people, which made it very easy for
[SPEAKER_02]: regular people that had no knowledge
whatsoever to become along.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say for perfect example is my mother
who worked for the police for 35 years and
[SPEAKER_02]: has no cannabis knowledge whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sat her down and she made some full melt
on her first batch ever of bubble bags
[SPEAKER_02]: just because I gave her the simple
instructions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of like when you don't have
this huge ego thinking that it's really a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot more being done than is being done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just like, oh, okay,
so I mix it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make sure it's cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I filter it through the bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoon it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I break it up and sort of anyone can kind
of do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Sam's art form was a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting glands that are dry sifted,
removed and cleaned to that level,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just did not exist in our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even now today with a few people
learning the DVD carding static trick and
[SPEAKER_02]: some other tricks, it's still very,
very much what I would consider the holy
[SPEAKER_02]: grail of hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't put water hash down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the highest level of water hash,
the highest, highest level six star is
[SPEAKER_02]: right on point with the highest level of
dry sifted resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's going to be the alcohol soluble
terpenes, the ones that don't wash out in
[SPEAKER_02]: water, the ones that stay present right
till the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, behind me, you can see some
pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this one's from Cuban.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got one from Sam right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some large amounts of resin being
sifted, almost 4,000 grams in about 10
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry sifted farmer's grade hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it would be a good idea to put
up some fun pictures behind me so that we
[SPEAKER_02]: could stare at beautiful hashish and the
cannabis plant that we love so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a wonderful history lesson
from Andrew and Jessica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess we're going to move up to Drew
who's next in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say, Drew?
[SPEAKER_02]: Unmute your mic and give us that history.
[SPEAKER_02]: What name do you go under?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Dr. Ladybug?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you came under Drew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dr. Ladybug was an account that I just
came across.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of the wild card.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew nothing about him, but I knew that
his hash was 100% on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that alone is, you know, it's kind of
like how people used to ask me about
[SPEAKER_02]: legends of hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I get a ticket to legends of
hashish?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm Soma, or I know Soma,
or I'm a well-known person in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, that doesn't actually get
you a ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: What gets you a ticket is having great
hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how you got your golden
ticket into this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give us a little history lesson on to-
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so my first exposure to hash was
when I was in high school.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was probably 14 or 15.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were smoking a lot of weed,
even at that age.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my buddy went to Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went to Amsterdam for about two weeks
or so.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he brought back some hash in a little
shampoo bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wrapped it in cellophane.
[SPEAKER_19]: Ah, the classic shampoo bottle.
[SPEAKER_19]: P.S.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not safe to smuggle in shampoo
bottles anymore.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he brought some of that back and it was
really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was blonde.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the old style hash, pressed
hashish.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty melty, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we didn't really know what it was,
the process, how to make it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All we knew is that it was made with ice
and water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a natural extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't really see too much of it other
than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't see it for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then when I started growing,
shortly after high school, when I was
[SPEAKER_05]: about 19, my growing mentor, he would make
hash from his trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually had the bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had the one gallon bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, back then we were
just growing like, you know, like little
[SPEAKER_05]: four by four tenths.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and, you know, we weren't- the concept
of washing whole flowers back then never
[SPEAKER_05]: even crossed our mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all from, it was like all trim run.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so I started making hash because I
preferred smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I pretty much didn't smoke any of the
flower that I grew.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of that stuff was sold and I just ran
on my trim and just like smoked that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the rest is kind of history.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hash has been like a big part of my life,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did take a small break from it for a
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing this on and off for about
12 years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right in the middle, I did take a
break, stepped away for a little while,
[SPEAKER_05]: went back to school.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, ever since 2013 or so,
I got a job in the industry as a delivery
[SPEAKER_05]: driver and just to make some connections.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I made some connections and,
you know, made some things happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, now I'm here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's actually really crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a surreal moment to even be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when, in 2013, were the connections
you made growers or are you also growing
[SPEAKER_02]: your own resin for the hash that you're
making?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we do grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have like an outdoor spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a buddy that I work with in
Southern California who does a lot of our
[SPEAKER_05]: indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, your product is absolutely on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: For anyone that wants to check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure everyone has Instagram accounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we'll go through the whole thing
and then we'll, I'll drop the Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: accounts for everyone as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll move on to Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Frenchy is going to tell us how he
fell in love with Hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this guy absolutely is in love
with Hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to unmute you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to unmute Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Push that mute button.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get him on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get him on.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's still muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't unmute him for some reason,
but he can if he goes and pushes the
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be a microphone and a little
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you got to click your,
your mouse on top of the box to bring it
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It disappears.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Hashishin club you were talking was
that those writers were some of my
[SPEAKER_06]: favorite writers when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up reading Thousand and One Nights.
[SPEAKER_06]: And before even smoking hash, I was really
dreaming of traveling in this country,
[SPEAKER_06]: Lawrence of Arabia, Marco Polo and all
those stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that the first time when I smoked,
which was like late, like I was 17,
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoked with Persian, Lebanese,
Moroccan kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was introduced to their family.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that I was, it's like I was,
I've always been in that ash culture
[SPEAKER_06]: flower for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, was just the materials that
hold the precious resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything was in the resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I was a kid, I didn't believe
that it would become legal in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to feel like I wasn't really the scum
of the world, I went and traveled into
[SPEAKER_06]: country where it was not legal,
but accepted.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did a bunch of ash country.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I went to India where it's
religious.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's part of the religion.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: A shalom is dedicated to the God.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plant was born in the drop of the
elixir of life that fall from the sky in
[SPEAKER_06]: the Himalaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a dimension that was much bigger
than what they had experienced before.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when I came here to the States,
I realized that it was actually also
[SPEAKER_06]: medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was discovery.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm so much in love.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because it's a long story.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 61.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been smoking ash all that time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like my life is truly dedicated to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really know it until lately,
but it's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to hear the histories, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just de-chasing my banger from a
mildly hot rip I took while you were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about your love of hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually looking for a little piece
of hash that I had from Roshan that you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys made together on the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to smoke some Frenchy hash
while you were talking about your love for
[SPEAKER_02]: hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I would have gotten over and seen
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt kind of bad that I never made it
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you came over here, I was quite
injured.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one that told me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't traveling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of the first time I got so
hurt that hashish just wasn't enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed the time to heal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You eat it?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was eating it, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some capsules made with some CBD and
some... No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean like instead of smoking your
ash, Oh, chewing just right on the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing else.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't do nothing but eat a little
chai.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea how much of a thing you
prefer to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a little bit of that in India with
the sadhu.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Shivaite sadhu would always make us
eat a little piece of the Nepali cream
[SPEAKER_02]: that we had while we were drinking our
chai tea out of the cups that were
[SPEAKER_02]: literally handmade that morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they would smash the cups every time
they finished drinking like a mausoleum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, big giant pile of clay cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pour a little water on it at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next morning, the guys forming cups out of
the clay again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit blew my mind actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: The simplicity and the beautifulness and
the lack of waste in being able to just
[SPEAKER_02]: recycle your clay cups over and over and
over again was just too much for my young
[SPEAKER_02]: mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: India before it was open to the outside
world when everything was made in India.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on the same place.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm afraid to go back to India because
when I was in India, they had three type
[SPEAKER_06]: of cars.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like everything, they were no
Coca-Cola, no nothing from the outside
[SPEAKER_06]: world.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like that little bubble of out of
time place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was still like that when I went as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam and I were talking about it just the
other day that India really is the new
[SPEAKER_02]: China, that it's very, very different from
the way it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that those bubbles can still be
located, but they're probably a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller than they were.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm writing a story about when I was in
the eighties in a mountain in India.
[SPEAKER_06]: People ask me to tell a story of my life
and it's hard, but I can write little
[SPEAKER_06]: adventure that I remember in a mountain or
doing stuff left and right.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is much easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've talked with people who are there now
and I see the road that goes to Malana.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is camp, there is chai shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was in Malana, in the eighties,
or when Mila was in Malana in the late
[SPEAKER_06]: sixties, early seventies, that was like
the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were in the middle of nowhere,
a field of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were no connection.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were like two or three days walk from
the closest road.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it takes a dimension where within the
plant where you are, the terroir where you
[SPEAKER_06]: stick it in your hand and make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the value you're collecting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not you making it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's you getting there, doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like what I'm trying to explain to
the people is that, yeah, people kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: appreciated that I made it myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the question was, where did you make
that charas in India or did you go in
[SPEAKER_06]: Morocco to make your ash or in Pakistan or
in Nepal?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the value of the resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: The value of the resin is your genetic and
your farmer and where it's been grown,
[SPEAKER_06]: the knowledge that is put and the
dedication behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the value of the resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot make quality if I am not given
the quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the picture on my IG, that's a credit
to my farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good at what I do, but I receive that
quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can enhance it in a certain way and
transform it into ashish and age it and
[SPEAKER_06]: make something different than the actual
loose resin that I collected.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I need that quality of loose resin to
get to what I can create with,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a winemaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, what it reminds me of is a quote
that I came up with a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: which sort of boils down everything you
just said, which is we are the unveilers
[SPEAKER_02]: of the flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: We unveil the flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't unveil it if it's not flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to unveil some other
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are the unveilers of the flame,
the hash makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's very, I liked that you
mentioned that we don't, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in so many words that it's not really a
great idea to get a big ego about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, being a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great if you're great at what you do,
but really you're receiving something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're unveiling something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you're making anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever seen a winemaker name on the
bottle of wine?
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the greatest winemaker in Bordeaux,
they don't have their name.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't need to have their name on the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody knows they made the wine because
it was through the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the name of the game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that is the name of the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well put.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm really looking forward to more
conversation with you today, Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get more stories out of you
for certain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about hashish here
in a bit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are now up to solventless mind who's
next up to bat to give us an idea on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how we got into jaw herbs,
how we got into hash, the history,
[SPEAKER_02]: the years.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I was a young kid, my dad was in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was making paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was making different products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, I mean, just growing up around
him and pretty much, I mean, he made like
[SPEAKER_07]: little like containers like these right
here that are waterproof and crush proof.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can like put some doobies in it,
throw it in your back pocket.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't got to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, other than that, I just,
you know, when I was 14, 15 years old,
[SPEAKER_07]: one of my friends, Dan, we found a bottle
of alcohol sitting in his house and there
[SPEAKER_07]: was a bunch of stems in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you got to mind I'm from Florida,
so we didn't have access to the most
[SPEAKER_07]: chronic ganja that you can get on earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had to, you know, use alcohol and
other methods like these extraction
[SPEAKER_07]: methods to get high.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: The ganja was just so garbage that you had
to do an alcohol wash on it to get high.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this dude's dad pretty much taught us
the way of doing alcohol washes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after alcohol washes came to BHO.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was about 17, 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've only been making ice water
extracts since I'm like 26, so about four
[SPEAKER_07]: years now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, it's life changing, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, like back in the day,
I didn't really believe it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I always thought it was like a
gimmick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, make ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't make that BHO.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you always preached it, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you always preached it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I remember back in the day,
you always preach it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't even want to hear about fucking
BHO.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would still talk about BHO,
you know, but you didn't like that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't, you didn't support it.
[SPEAKER_07]: None of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, eventually I got a set of
your bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once I got your bags, dude, that was it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got your bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a fucking machine, a 20 gallon
bubble now machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, we started running as much
material as we could find here in
[SPEAKER_07]: Humboldt, you know, and it literally
changed my life, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It made it to where like, I realized you
could get a bomb ass product without even
[SPEAKER_07]: endangering your life at all, at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't gotta worry about a fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't gotta worry about exploding.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't gotta worry about shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just turn the fucking dial on a
machine and fucking you safe.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that, that to me was like life
changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I don't know, like as far as
the history goes, it starts with just
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to get as high as I could because
the ganja was garbage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on to, you know, better ganja.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew back in Florida too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had access to my own ganja that I
could blast with butane.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was no way when I lived in
Florida that I could ever wash it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just simply couldn't grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: We couldn't produce enough to make it
worth washing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that I'm in Humboldt County,
let's be real.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's fucking ganja everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like 6,000 gardens around me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's fucking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like water here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can have access to anything,
clean material, shitty material,
[SPEAKER_07]: trim, nugs, dry, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's like, you know, what else is
there to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn straight, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, I loved that your dad was into
making paraphernalia and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so when you were growing up,
were you kind of like looking up to him or
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking up to him a hundred percent,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm doing it for him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like he's not here anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: He passed away in 2011 for Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he always told me, get to Cali,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll do something with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, mad respect to your old man for
real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inspiring you to get into all of this
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that Humboldt is like it's
water everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that that was BC in the
nineties now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could find it for a lot of
places, but there's definitely not 6,000
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens around me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it literally is everywhere up here,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to have access.
[SPEAKER_07]: You play with a lot of different
residents.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't just get one, you know,
you don't just get one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grower's perspective of resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get greenhouse, you get outdoor,
you get indoor, you get all these
[SPEAKER_07]: different varieties of resin and you get
to work with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you get to learn dry resin,
greasy resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's really better?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's really better?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the greasy shit that turns in
the oil in your jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as you step outside, is it the
drier stuff that stays more of a hash?
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you touch it to the nail,
it still melts like six star.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you start to understand like
what foods they're feeding, the
[SPEAKER_07]: environments they're growing in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is colder climate better?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is hotter climate better?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are salts better?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are organics better?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you start to, oh yeah,
resin to kind of get grasp on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get an overview that almost
no one else has.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what another part of my luck
was when I started running Renee back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the, in the late nineties, um,
that, that suddenly, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my buddy had a 10 lighter, then he had a
30 lighter, then he had a hundred lighter,
[SPEAKER_02]: then he had 200 lighters and he was just
[SPEAKER_02]: as nice a resin and as high of a yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: As giving his bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the beginning of,
you know, then all of a sudden I just
[SPEAKER_02]: started selling everyone bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I sold them bags, I'd make hash
with their materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also got to make people's hash with,
with so many different growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: so many different genetics, every one of
them thinking that they had the best shit
[SPEAKER_02]: on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in reality, just like you said,
they were all growing in, in different
[SPEAKER_02]: enough ways that the resin itself was
completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you see like six to 10 different
resins, then you realize, Whoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is way.
[SPEAKER_02]: No wonder the numbers are the way they
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, the numbers were simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted people to be inspired to use
these bags to make great hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact of the matter is most people
ran swag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people didn't get excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear around 2012 and 2013 from
just the stories on the panel,
[SPEAKER_02]: there seemed to become a shift into making
water hash again, because you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the majority of people that are involved
in cannabis and this isn't a diss against
[SPEAKER_02]: oil, because you've seen me have BHO
makers and sellers and buyers here on hash
[SPEAKER_02]: church.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if it's done at the highest level
that, you know, I certainly don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like you said, I don't necessarily
want to personally support it and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I prefer these methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been pushing it on people for so
long, but the numbers are that I would
[SPEAKER_02]: work all these different batches to find
the really great ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the majority of people out in the
world didn't have that luxury.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just had what they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it didn't hit that water hash
lottery, it wasn't going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a hundred percent, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like you really get a lot more
experience working with different growers
[SPEAKER_07]: materials.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you just work with one growers
material, I mean, you can be put on the
[SPEAKER_07]: spot one day where you got to wash
someone's stuff and you look like a new,
[SPEAKER_07]: you look like a dumb ass because you have
no idea what to do with this material
[SPEAKER_07]: because you've only watched like fresh
frozen right out of the garden nugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've only got this result.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know what it is to have this
result.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what is it to have 40% rosin from
your hash or 60% rosin instead of 75,
[SPEAKER_07]: 80% on everything you press.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't believe whole plant fresh
frozen is honestly the best way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I don't believe that's the best way,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I've done enough washes now to where
you can watch whole plant fresh frozen and
[SPEAKER_07]: still not get six star.
[SPEAKER_07]: And your yields are suffering like a
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, if you really think about
it, if you watch the same material,
[SPEAKER_07]: let's say you've got the same grower,
you watch a 20 pound bag of this shit,
[SPEAKER_07]: fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you watch a 20 pound bag of this shit
dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can achieve the same melt from dry
material, how the fuck is that not better
[SPEAKER_07]: when you yield almost half more?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just say you yield like half more of
what you would have got had you stopped on
[SPEAKER_07]: the fresh frozen washes.
[SPEAKER_07]: How is that not better?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is because their perspective,
the majority of people are coming from a
[SPEAKER_02]: different perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming from the, I just want my
three and a half star to look like four
[SPEAKER_02]: star.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to cheat that melt effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to microplane my hash and I'm
also going to run it fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can save any sort of terpenes that
might be lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus potentially even get a little
moisture in my hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people hold a flame to it,
it looks like it's bubbling, but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: not really the right path to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the passionate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not being truthful to yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, you're allowing yourself to be,
you know, it's crazy how profit margin
[SPEAKER_02]: always creates deception and how when you
make it about almost like spiritual,
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say religion, but spiritual or
your passion, your love that you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: do better than just make money,
you know, and, and we all know that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can make money blasting anything and
turning it into a distillate and adding
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit turps and throwing it into cheap
pens that are probably in themselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: not very healthy to inhale through.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like I've seen finger press hash
stuff that you could put on a paper,
[SPEAKER_07]: finger press it out completely ready for
it to have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as soon as you touch it to the nail,
it's just char all over the fucking place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's not six star, but like people,
they don't understand it just because you
[SPEAKER_07]: can finger press it and it's greasy does
not make it six star melt quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, and taking a no temp dab does not
justify it either.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't take four star at fucking 250
degrees and go, yo, look at the six star.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause as soon as I take a real dab of it,
I'm going to see the real chart.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, I don't, I don't know,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel there's a lot of gimmicks out there
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we used to just call it full melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it was not full melt,
it was faux melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, yeah, the faux melt.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good shit right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to move over to,
I just can't wait to get into an actual
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation with everyone involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get through the last three folks
on the panel here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got skunk man, Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Howdy, howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Howdy, howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to tell us when you got into
your love of cannabis and how well when I
[SPEAKER_11]: first started smoking hashish was actually
quite a while ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was in 1965.
[SPEAKER_11]: I lived in Hollywood and, uh, I,
I was able to obtain some red Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_11]: We, what we normally saw there,
of course, was a Mexican, which was quite
[SPEAKER_11]: inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was $50 a kilo at the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas red Lebanese was like a hundred
dollars an ounce.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was $80 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, that was a bit rich for my blood,
but, uh, I wanted to try it and I did.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the first time I tried it,
I just went, wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, but trying to get it for, uh,
uh, my poverty status, it wasn't very easy
[SPEAKER_11]: to, uh, to keep it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then in 1970, I traveled to Morocco
specifically to check out hashish.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, at the time in 1970, hashish was,
uh, maybe $20 to a hundred dollars a kilo
[SPEAKER_11]: for the very super super in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_11]: And depending on the quality and quantity,
uh, 20 to a hundred bucks a kilo,
[SPEAKER_11]: it doesn't seem expensive today.
[SPEAKER_11]: It really started my journey, how they
made it in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, within a year I had continued my
travels and, uh, over the hippie hashish
[SPEAKER_11]: trail had, uh, made it through,
uh, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan,
[SPEAKER_11]: India, Nepal, where hashish, uh,
was made in like Manali, Kulu,
[SPEAKER_11]: Kashmir, uh, also up in Kathmandu and the
surrounding areas in Nepal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, later, uh, in 19, the mid 1980s,
we were growing cannabis here in,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, Amsterdam and we noticed, or I noticed
actually that resin was falling off a
[SPEAKER_11]: little bit of the really, really good
buds.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, dried buds.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, I went out and bought a silk
screen and did all the manicuring on top
[SPEAKER_11]: of it just to see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, I was able to collect a dry sip
that was, uh, good enough to melt and
[SPEAKER_11]: bubble.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I couldn't even believe it the first
time I smoked it, uh, and it melted and
[SPEAKER_11]: bubbled.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, once I had collected resin that
was really, really clean like that,
[SPEAKER_11]: and I saw it melt and bubble, uh,
it really changed, uh, what I started
[SPEAKER_11]: smoking because I had been smoking herb,
uh, in massive amounts.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, after that, uh, I really switched
over to, uh, my own resin and,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, it also helped my lungs quite a bit
because, uh, I had a tendency just to spit
[SPEAKER_11]: when I woke up in the morning and sort of
dark discolored shit would come out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, after I started smoking resin
only, uh, that cleared up really,
[SPEAKER_11]: really good.
[SPEAKER_11]: The other, uh, thing I wanted to mention
besides how I got into it was,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, why different kinds of, uh,
hashish traditional production is
[SPEAKER_11]: fundamentally different.
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, in Afghanistan, they make dry
sift as in Lebanon, Morocco, and,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, Turkey and several other countries.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, whereas in Nepal, they make,
uh, hand rub from, uh, more ganja plants
[SPEAKER_11]: than, uh, hashish plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And why is it that ganja like Thai weed
and, uh, other countries like in,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, Columbia and other countries is mostly
just THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, whereas, uh, Afghan often has
significant amounts of other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: The basic reason is that ganja farmers can
smoke each plant or the best looking
[SPEAKER_11]: plants they grow and save the seeds for
the next year of the best, most resonance
[SPEAKER_11]: plants that have the effects and potency
they prefer.
[SPEAKER_11]: And over years and years and years of the
farmers doing this, the plants eventually
[SPEAKER_11]: are really just THC and the terpenes that
they prefer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas hashish farmers, uh, for imported
dry hashish farmers like in Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_11]: they don't really smoke individual plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: They never do.
[SPEAKER_11]: They smoke resin made from a whole field
of plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what they do is they save the seeds
from the plants with the most resin,
[SPEAKER_11]: but that resin can be THC or it can be a
THC CBD mix, or it can even be just CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have no way to judge what the resin
of a single plant is.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they save the seeds from all the plants
that have lots of resin, regardless of
[SPEAKER_11]: what that resin is.
[SPEAKER_11]: And over the years, uh, of doing this,
what the farmers end up with is 25% of
[SPEAKER_11]: their plants are high in THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: 25% of them are high in CBD and 50% of
them are high in THC CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it makes, uh, the dry sift in
Afghanistan quite different from,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, the Himalayan hand rub ganja plants,
which are predominantly THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's funny though.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some, some smokers actually prefer Afghan
with CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, I guarantee you, if you smoke
Afghan resin, you get high as a kite,
[SPEAKER_11]: but, uh, it's a bit different.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, some of the old traditional
smokers used to say that they preferred
[SPEAKER_11]: Himalayan hand rub because it was higher
and, uh, more iry and, uh, Afghan was more
[SPEAKER_11]: physical and more stoned.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, even though the Afghan was a bit
cleaner resin, the, uh, hand rub was,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, a different cannabinoid makeup.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was, uh, different.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, also all traditional dry sift ash was
made from seeded plants, not unseeded
[SPEAKER_11]: sincey.
[SPEAKER_11]: And seeding plants will reduce the
cannabinoid and terpene percentages in the
[SPEAKER_11]: case of terpenes by even slightly more
than half.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it fundamentally changes the nature of
the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I will say thank you, Sam,
because I enjoyed all of that thoroughly
[SPEAKER_02]: from the ridiculous amount of hashese
producing countries that you visited early
[SPEAKER_02]: on in your hash smoking career,
uh, right into the knowledge that you
[SPEAKER_02]: dropped right at the end there that I'm
sure a lot of people haven't really
[SPEAKER_02]: considered choosing from a field to grow
seed from versus single plants over many,
[SPEAKER_02]: many generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool topic to, uh, to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll get more into that when we
talk about hashish making here in the near
[SPEAKER_02]: future, after we go through the last two
panelists and we are at Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: How is everybody today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surrounded by hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got hashed up to Tunis from like Afghan
old hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got these bottles of hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got dry sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got some of the first hash we ever made
together in 2012, but it came back from
[SPEAKER_08]: Aspen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in Amsterdam and I met you,
but I mean, my story hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I started smoking probably in the early
eighties and that was that Lebanese blonde
[SPEAKER_08]: hash that he picked up at the sky train or
he got some black scorpion, black cash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a little gold snap on it sometimes
and it was like, wow, man, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: He's smoking hash for a long time and what
really came down to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as everyone's people don't know,
I think I fell about injured really bad
[SPEAKER_08]: and I started using different concentrates
for my pain control.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was using a lot of ganja for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in 2012, when I met you on the
plane, we were chatting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I came back and I wanted to bring you some
of that sift that I just made.
[SPEAKER_08]: You showed me how to clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we carted that shit for an hour,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: We put that on that screen and that stuff
bubbled like I've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just like, it was a life
changer at the same time.
[SPEAKER_08]: What it did for me, you saw how it changed
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I've been growing my own because
of what happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've always been doing my
concentrates, but I never made any BHOs
[SPEAKER_08]: with any of my products.
[SPEAKER_08]: It used to always me was all about this
first bounce, which I talk about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would trim my plants above my screens.
[SPEAKER_08]: It hit the screen and I would clean that
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when I met you, I had different
screens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I started getting different things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I started washing my hash
differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: It changed my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: It totally changed my life on how it would
be able to affect me on a daily level for
[SPEAKER_08]: my pain and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I started realizing how much the
concentrates were working better than the
[SPEAKER_08]: flowers, how much cleaner it was than
using the BHOs or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And today it's about like I ran out to the
garage half an hour before church,
[SPEAKER_08]: grabbed some sift from a trim bin,
threw it on the screens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did the static little sift that we're
talking about with the DVD, cleaned up
[SPEAKER_08]: some beautiful blonde foam out hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do work with you guys talk about hash
because it's just like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been around my life for 30 years and
I've been growing for since late eighties.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've always had different ways of
being able to have that triclone and
[SPEAKER_08]: really learning and seeing the difference
over the years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And how it came and being on the panel
here and talking to you guys about what
[SPEAKER_08]: is, what we're talking about here today is
this plant and how we're able to extract
[SPEAKER_08]: it and get some fine medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, Johnny V.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll finish it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually we won't finish it off
because I'm pretty sure soil grown Sal and
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuban grower are waiting in the ranks for,
you know, in the next maybe 30 or so
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes, we'll get them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now we've got the dank duchess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's who wasn't finding the link,
but we made it work.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't make it seem like I lost the link
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_16]: It just lost in the ether.
[SPEAKER_16]: But hello.
[SPEAKER_16]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is a dank duchess.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the way I got into hashish was okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, one sec, one sec.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you might need to play with your
mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, uh, am I the only one that's
hearing that the way it's coming through
[SPEAKER_02]: or did other people hear that as well?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little choppy for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, choppy.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might just be unplug and plug your
mic into the computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes that helps.
[SPEAKER_16]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a little bit choppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can deal with it if everyone else can
deal with it, but it's more like loud and
[SPEAKER_02]: the vacuuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lab, the lab, we get to the last one
and it's like technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it like working now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to have a little bit of a
feedback towards the end of your speech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you sure that's not just my cadence?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's your mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your mic away from your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: 70 mama says.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just, try that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know that something happened
differently.
[SPEAKER_16]: Have her turn down her bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_16]: How exactly would I turn down my
bandwidth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you push your mouse into the center of
the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those icons at the top appear and then
you go to the one that looks like a wifi
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put the mouse over, it'll say
adjust bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about medium?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's medium working out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know if it's a, if it's that
low.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is super unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm super bummed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can restart your computer and
boot back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, seriously?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know any other troubleshooting
other than unplugging.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few times, a few times it's happened in
the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have unplugged their mic,
plugged it in, and it's been better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got to mute you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still loud and bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we're going to have to,
I think it's going to have to be an unboot
[SPEAKER_02]: and reboot thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm reading about in the chat
or try other headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really bad without headphones for
sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Marcus, just go to the next speaker and
come to her next.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the next speaker was her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was the last in the whole group.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we could talk about Hashish until she
gets, you know, she's welcome to join in
[SPEAKER_02]: any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can just text into the chat room,
say, hey, let's try this again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will break up what we're saying and
get right back to her because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we talk about resin a bit further and
the difference between the Hindu Kush and
[SPEAKER_06]: the feet of the Himalaya?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes, it's like, you know, the French,
we're talking about the terroir,
[SPEAKER_06]: the land bring a lot to the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plant in the mountain in India,
it's all green.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a lot of insect life.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plant has to have a lot of protection.
[SPEAKER_06]: The resin is very sticky to be able to
deal with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you go, when you go into the Hindu
Kush, where it's very windy, there is
[SPEAKER_06]: little vegetation and a lot of dust,
the resin cannot be sticky because
[SPEAKER_06]: otherwise it would have a lot of dust on
it and the function of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that the plant not only became a short
plant because it's windy with big fan
[SPEAKER_06]: leaves, because it's farther from the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: They need more surface to absorb the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the resin itself, that's changed and
you can literally make the difference
[SPEAKER_06]: between a large leaf type genetic or a
thin leaf type genetic by the stickiness
[SPEAKER_06]: of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: For you here, you call that grease and
beach sand, but it's literally the genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: showing through the resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as you can recognize a genetic by
the flower, you can recognize the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: by the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love where Sam was going with it,
with the difference between choosing from
[SPEAKER_02]: the field versus... Turn that down,
soil grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone must have left for you to get in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just clicked the button.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hopped on in, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm about ready to make some rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Dank Duchess is trying to get her
microphone working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess in the meantime, why don't you do
a little introduction, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you get into the herbs and hash and
of course, soil grown sows in the house?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that for me?
[SPEAKER_12]: That is for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's see, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been passionate about cannabis since
about high school, really got into it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was with one of my buddies in football
and I'd say just throughout high school,
[SPEAKER_12]: I was really in search of always finding
the best.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was really it, is just finding
the best herbs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then about 2009, I went to Amsterdam
and that's where I really was stoked about
[SPEAKER_12]: all the hash that was available.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's really all I got when I was in
Amsterdam, just hash, hash, hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I actually brought some home with me,
that's how stoked I was about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So around that time, I moved back to
California and didn't really know much of
[SPEAKER_12]: what to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I started growing and started a little
clone business, selling clones and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: And from there, I made some connections,
got into the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_12]: working for dispensaries and running
through different strains and flowers and
[SPEAKER_12]: hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what seemed to be popular at the time
was a lot of VHO, not too much water hash
[SPEAKER_12]: or sift.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I actually got into the VHO extraction,
unfortunately, but I mean, it was a path I
[SPEAKER_12]: needed to take in order to get me to where
I am now.
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually had some problems,
got a little hurt doing it and promised my
[SPEAKER_12]: family that I'd never do VHO extraction
again.
[SPEAKER_12]: And started studying water extraction,
dry sift and really fell in love with the
[SPEAKER_12]: water hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once I realized that I was able to produce
an incredible product, with just water and
[SPEAKER_12]: ice, just that was it for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, yeah, just from there,
we set up a little cold room and hash lab
[SPEAKER_12]: and just started doing a lot of washing
and just stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Haven't really played with too much other
things, just mostly water hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the Rosentech, which came from
water hash, it wasn't for me making water
[SPEAKER_12]: hash, probably would have never stumbled
upon Rosentech.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Symbiotic relationship right there,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you fired through that fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love people's stories, because that's
how they got where they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree 100% with you, dude,
that the way you get to where you are is
[SPEAKER_02]: by doing exactly what you did,
not regretting the things you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do them to lead you to where you're
headed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's noble.
[SPEAKER_12]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_12]: Put me on the path to where I am now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't complain about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I love that Rosin and Bubble Hash
are intimately linked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, no, nobody said he invented Rosin
Dabby DeVito, or maybe they did in the
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what he actually did was he
reestablished and popularized the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: is used today, because Rosin originally
was a double boiler with a silver or a
[SPEAKER_02]: glass bowl that you milked your hash with
with a spoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what Soil Grown came up with was
squishing first hash and then eventually a
[SPEAKER_02]: bud in his parchment paper and seeing oil
come off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine how lucky you were to get the
right temperature with the right bud at
[SPEAKER_02]: the right time to see that so that you
could be like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I was not lucky at first.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, the first way that I pressed
Rosin out was with a piece of hash on an
[SPEAKER_12]: email.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I actually put a piece of hash into a
piece of parchment and I pressed it with
[SPEAKER_12]: my thumb onto the email and I pulled it
off.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's when I seen a small amount of
oil on the side of the paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's where my idea that I had,
it proved to me that it could work.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was able to give my father-in-law
the first dab of Rosin within our garage.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were just in awe, flipping out,
couldn't believe it happened.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd say for about two weeks,
I was giving friends dabs and stuff,
[SPEAKER_12]: just pressing hash on the email,
burning my thumb.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's when one of my buddies,
he told me about a t-shirt press.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, actually, no, actually, I had a hair
curler.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was using a hair curler after that
and it wasn't working out too well.
[SPEAKER_12]: The hash would pop out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes it would work.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my wife had come into the garage and
she flipped out because I was using her
[SPEAKER_12]: expensive hair curler I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she brought me some broken up,
it was like a rundown hair straightener,
[SPEAKER_12]: but that worked perfect.
[SPEAKER_12]: So once I used that two flat plates,
two hot flat plates worked way better than
[SPEAKER_12]: a round hair curler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's always the wife because I'm
telling you, bubble bags wouldn't exist if
[SPEAKER_02]: it weren't for my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: She sewed all the first ones that was
like, I couldn't find anyone to sew them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all wanted like 15 or $20 per bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Oh man, I got to figure this
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was my wife who was like,
I'll sew the first bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was your wife who brought you the
rundown hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, to the wives, to the wives.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, are we going to try that mic
again, Dank Duchess?
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'll try.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I was going to get sad and I do the
ugly cry.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the way that I got into weed,
I was just say no.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nancy Reagan had taught me so very well.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was very, very anti cannabis all the way
into, into my twenties.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was a happenstance, beautiful piece
of glass that made me feel like to try the
[SPEAKER_15]: weed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as soon as I tried the weed and I did
calculus, I was a math major in college.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did some calculus.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I realized that they lied after that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just a big pothead and Mike Thomas,
I was in Florida.
[SPEAKER_15]: So who knows what kind of crap you were
getting.
[SPEAKER_15]: And my husband would get like some weed
and I thought that we could do better.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we started growing in the closet,
maybe in 2004, I think in 2004,
[SPEAKER_15]: we were growing the closet super paranoid
for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I lived next door to a cop and the
police station.
[SPEAKER_15]: So every single time the cops would come
back to their station, I knew this was the
[SPEAKER_15]: time that they were going to get me.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the time I was going to get
arrested today, today, today.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in fact, the day that before we left
for California, I nearly got into a huge
[SPEAKER_15]: fight.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, this is the universe saying
get the fuck out of Florida.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in 2014, we moved across the coast to
California and on happenstance I met
[SPEAKER_15]: Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew about dabbing, but I went to a high
times and Frenchy had all this hash in
[SPEAKER_15]: front of him.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought it was chocolate,
but I asked if it would be dabs.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, well, of course.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I dabs it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: A month later, I saw him at another event
and I was lamenting about how I couldn't
[SPEAKER_15]: find like a bullshit blood tender job.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had come over there just to do media.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a writer and I wanted to do video and
all kinds of things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Frenchy agreed to have lunch with me.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, he had coffee with me.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in doing that, he asked me to write
for Readwell magazine.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I got into hash because he wanted me to
write for Readwell magazine, but I didn't
[SPEAKER_15]: know anything about hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: And frankly, I didn't even want to learn
how to make cash.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I did because the man said that was
what I needed to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't know he was any big deal or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I learned how to make cash and just so
that I could write about it and explain
[SPEAKER_15]: other people's process and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then I continued making cash behind
his back.
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't let him know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Started posting on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_15]: He didn't get on Instagram until a couple
of months later.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, from then I've just been
accumulating information from various
[SPEAKER_15]: people.
[SPEAKER_15]: And interestingly, on this panel right
here, I've written about you, Marcus for
[SPEAKER_15]: Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've written about Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've written about Thomas.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm writing about Drew's hash right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what I specialize in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really bringing light to other people's
hash because I get to smoke a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: So my experience with hash is a little bit
different because I came in late,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I smoke a lot, a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just for the whole purpose of making
stories.
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, I don't make cash.
[SPEAKER_15]: You see what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's where I am.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm obviously a hash lover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has such unique different
stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely hear a lot around the
2012-2013 timeline of people getting
[SPEAKER_02]: reintroduced to water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely taken on another sort of a
full revolution in the sense it's coming
[SPEAKER_02]: full around to where people are getting
inspired to, you know, at least one way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry sifting is another great way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love both of them at their highest
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just which one is the most accessible
and the easiest at the time to make is
[SPEAKER_02]: usually the path that I travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we pretty much linked with
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Cuban is waiting to get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see if maybe someone wants to.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can drop out if you guys want.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to chat with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got some great knowledge on hash and
all that stuff you got going on over
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying, you know, I'll throw that
out there if he wants to come in and
[SPEAKER_07]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to come in soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sent a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say we get into a little bit of a
hashish discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely like the idea here in the
presence of hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least the presence in North America and
I wouldn't say most of Europe because they
[SPEAKER_02]: still have a decent import market there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely are on the path of making,
you know, hash from plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically, you know, bred over time to
be hash makers, to be resin, to be
[SPEAKER_02]: extracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that does definitely make a very,
very different hash than if you were to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it from like a field, you know,
somewhere near the equator, like Sam was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about the different profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't cut out all the other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is interesting how, you know,
prohibition and I guess the love of
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking and the love of THC really led us
down this path that a lot of these,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, genetics have, they don't really
exist in the higher numbers that they did
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not saying that they don't exist at all,
not saying that they can't be bred back
[SPEAKER_02]: into existence if they don't, but it
definitely would seem that the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles that we're making hash with these
days are mostly in the high THC realm,
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessarily with the majority of
other, you know, cannabinoid rich options.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll just keep talking then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I wanted to mention one thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to go into maybe a little bit
about fresh frozen and kind of the
[SPEAKER_14]: difference between that and dry run.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone's opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I know, you know, I've had weed in
the freezer for a year and a half that it
[SPEAKER_08]: was fresh and frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've done a lot of fresh frozen and me
and Mark, we've talked about it quite a
[SPEAKER_08]: bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's sometimes in certain people,
Frenchy, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, there is two peak of quality in a
resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you are, when you collect it live on
a plant made charas, the first ever
[SPEAKER_06]: concentrate was our ancestor touching a
bud for the first time to get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: That resin stuck on his hand was the first
concentrate ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is a very good chance that that
dude put that in his mouth to experience
[SPEAKER_06]: what it was because our ancestor to invent
agriculture went through 200,000 plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: just the one that make seeds and fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: From those 200,000, there is maybe a
thousand edible, hundreds that you can
[SPEAKER_06]: domesticate and half dozen that feed the
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people who invented agriculture passed
down generation after generation orally
[SPEAKER_06]: over 200,000 plant and every potential,
every one of those plants had.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a knowledge of the plant kingdom
that was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that the first time one of our
ancestors touched that plant and had the
[SPEAKER_06]: resin on his hand can go back so far in
town.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like it can be as far as 2 million
years ago when humanity moved from Africa
[SPEAKER_06]: on the Euro-Asian continent.
[SPEAKER_06]: 2 million years ago, you had hominous from
Papua New Guinea to Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: At that time, we may already have
discovered and move around the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be that far.
[SPEAKER_06]: The relation we have with that plant,
there is no plant like that that had been
[SPEAKER_06]: so far back in time that we cannot
pinpoint the birthplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely goes back very, very far in
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suspect much.
[SPEAKER_06]: How come?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always a flower, but there is nothing
about raising.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like there is a huge mystery about
that in the history of humanity because it
[SPEAKER_06]: must have been a huge part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somewhere, somebody did the opposite that
what was happening in China where they
[SPEAKER_06]: breeded that plant to make hemp,
to make fiber and seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That plant was born boss.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the other side, because when you breed
for something, you know the potential of
[SPEAKER_06]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody was breeding that plant further
way before 10,000 years ago somewhere in
[SPEAKER_06]: the mountain of the Hindu Kush,
Central Asia, or at the feet of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a huge block that we have no
knowledge of it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't keep this plant down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always maintain some form of connection
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, what other plant has
companioned humans for that far?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty incredible relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't read Michael Pollan's The
Botany of Desire, he gets into it a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really great book for anyone
watching that wants to read a great book
[SPEAKER_02]: from today's lecture, today's talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one that's worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have something you wanted to say?
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to mention that cannabis
evolution and ethnobotany by Robert Clark
[SPEAKER_11]: is also a brilliant tool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And hashish by Robert Clark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put an invitation out to Rob for
today's episode, but he was in a very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very different time zone and it was just
going to be too difficult for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely will blow smoke towards the
Vatican for you, Sir Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are great books.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Cuban said he was going to pop in
in a bit and he can do his introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, we can just get into
talking about still the present of
[SPEAKER_02]: hashish, where we are with hashish right
now today, 2008.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you define the methodology we do first
to everyone?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we extracting or are we sieving?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have a huge... Well,
we're for sure sieving.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the extracting part could be argued,
depending on the definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: The definition of what you think
extracting means or isolating or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's definitely... It's a two part.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're breaking those heads off and then
we're letting them sieve and sink through
[SPEAKER_02]: the sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my perspective, anyway, it's kind of
one of the things that makes hash hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it's a big deal because for me,
it's the only true evolution in a game
[SPEAKER_06]: that is thousand and thousand and thousand
years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the tool has had an evolution,
but been a change in the methodology of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis raising, sieving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Water changed everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It brings a lot on the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't believe that you lose any
soluble terpen because the terpen are
[SPEAKER_06]: formed inside that membrane.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as the membrane is not broken,
you cannot lose what's inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you lose, it's at that breaking
point of the resin egg breaking from the
[SPEAKER_06]: stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're breaking those heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because there's no denying that
there's terpenes left in the water after a
[SPEAKER_02]: good wash.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no terpenes in the air of the
drying room when you sieve.
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have never done trim for trim.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dry sieve, ice water, and we really,
really need to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I've done it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trim for trim tested in lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I tested it in my bioassay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it with... Find the difference in
terpen.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is any difference between dry
sieve and ice water, to define the best
[SPEAKER_06]: methodology to retain the most terpen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think depending on the cultivar you'll
use, what I saw through my own bioassay,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a pretty fine tuned machine,
I will have you know, is that I found a
[SPEAKER_02]: great deal of closeness when it was a
cultivar like Renee that didn't wash its
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes into the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water had a mild smell and taste and
color, but at the end, the hash still
[SPEAKER_02]: stunk like the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be said for some cultivars,
but it can't be said for all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some cultivars just don't have a lot of
flavor at the end of the hash making
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some hold like almost all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always, as a water hash maker,
looked for cultivars that would preserve
[SPEAKER_02]: water soluble terpenes or alcohol soluble
terpenes to try and find ones that weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: being washed into the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the lab one day says something
differently, then I'll change the way I
think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, it's just, it's flavor and
taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can taste it when I drink the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smell it when I smell the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that they're the terpenes because I
recognize their smell from the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: I absolutely agree with you, Marcus,
that terpenes do wash away with some
[SPEAKER_11]: varieties in water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely no doubt.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all, not all.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're lucky enough to not all
terpenes, not all varieties, but it can
[SPEAKER_11]: happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a question for you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming through the stock, it's precursor
of terpenes that are coming from the
[SPEAKER_06]: tricone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the precursor of terpenes is stored
in the rosetta under the belly of the
[SPEAKER_06]: tricone.
[SPEAKER_06]: The vacuole.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then terpenes come inside the tricone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you, how can you lose terpenes
that are inside the tricone?
[SPEAKER_11]: I can explain it to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: You use water to sift plants and you've
collected the resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is now wet resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though it's covered with the natural
wax cover, each of those little resin
[SPEAKER_11]: heads, the resin is now wet.
[SPEAKER_11]: The water got into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the water can get in, the terpenes
can get out.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely, some of it's a hydrophilic
and some of it's hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it just seems to pull water in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen it with the buttering
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's the same with rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: The quality of the cultivar will come into
play.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thickness of the, of the membrane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome, Cuban grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on, homes?
[SPEAKER_04]: What up?
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw like everybody stopped talking when
I got in.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we, well, it was just the natural end
of a conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good conversation that a
Frenchie brought up in regards to,
[SPEAKER_02]: or someone brought up about fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot how good I looked on camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, you're looking good with that
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like clean and clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to, I'm a handsome guy,
but I'm within a group of handsome people
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like much of hash guys,
hash women.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank touches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going soil grown Frenchie?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the house, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we've all kind of done our little
introduction on who we are and how we got
[SPEAKER_02]: into herbs and hash and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we'll have you go through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where, where, where do you want to start?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I got into the ash game or,
you know, start with how you got into
[SPEAKER_02]: urban, how that led you into hash,
whether it was the game or just the love.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, I mean, it was the love.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started smoking weed when I was 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of our culture in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a bunch of big smokers out there,
especially what we call the cribby,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is since the media.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from a young age, you know,
we were definitely weed snobs,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that carried on to a fascination in
growing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I got tired of when I moved in
crappy quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started going from smoking no seeds
to smoking seeds, germinating the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Figuring out how to select a female and a
male.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew two females in a closet and I went
from probably 150 bucks overhead to
[SPEAKER_04]: selling $300 ounces.
[SPEAKER_04]: Made like a good stack off of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, damn, this is a good business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to smoke, make money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I went back to South Florida and I
brought my little, my little 400 water and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that, you know, and I was
moving it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt cool with that light.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I didn't know is that my cousin
that was helping me had grow operations
[SPEAKER_04]: all across Dade County.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's there like looking at me like,
what do you know about this bulb?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, man, what do you know about this
bulb?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, bro, I'll show you what I know
about these bulbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from that, that changed my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: My cousin put me under his wing,
taught me everything that started the
[SPEAKER_04]: foundation for me in commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did that for a couple of years,
but like anything in the prohibition era,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially a city and state like Florida
doesn't last very long, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started seeing our partners catching
charges, losing houses and money going
[SPEAKER_04]: from going up to starting to crash.
[SPEAKER_04]: During that time, I had got divorced and
my cousin was real strict about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he told me that if I got
divorced, I had to get out of the game as
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got out, got with the Cuban Hash Queen
and we started our life from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spent a couple of years in Florida,
not growing, fixing cell phones and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wasn't happy with my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, man, I remember the days when
we used to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my wife encouraged me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sold everything we had, my cars,
our TVs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We took that money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't much.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like $8,000?
[SPEAKER_04]: $7,000 I took with me with my kid and my
wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I flew to Washington without knowing
anybody because I knew that I had it in me
[SPEAKER_04]: to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we went in there fixing phones.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife was working a job and was trying
to get trim jobs and learning how to make
[SPEAKER_04]: extracts until I met the right guy that
decided to listen to my story about what I
[SPEAKER_04]: did in date and believe in what I could
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he invested in me and he really blew
me up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to start growing and that's all
before I even started my Cuban Grower
[SPEAKER_04]: account is around that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I used to smoke a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would spend my weed money on hash,
but I wasn't happy with the quality that I
[SPEAKER_04]: was buying.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see when you're spending thousands of
dollars to smoke and you bring it home and
[SPEAKER_04]: it isn't like what it is on the YouTubes
and stuff, you kind of, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: get motivated to make your own.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I bought myself a bubble man washer,
set of bubble man bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my first wash was better than anything
I had bought and smoked that year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was convinced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were one of the lucky ones,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were the ones that I wished everyone
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that already had dank but just
needed to unveil it in a way that they'd
[SPEAKER_02]: never seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well that fucked my life up,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be honest because I had like seven
different strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six of them didn't melt, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I was the worst hash maker ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, why is my hash coming up,
Brown?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it half melt?
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost want to quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, man, this isn't for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I would go back to that one
strain, which was my haze, it would treat
[SPEAKER_04]: me right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would dump, it would melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started figuring out, okay,
maybe I'm not growing the right cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started switching stuff up.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it didn't melt, it was gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it filled a whole room of haze until
stuff started to fill its place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it made me realize that the
material really is what dictates the final
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all been giving mad blessings to
the producers and the product,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it be us that are growing it
ourselves or whether it be someone that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've connected with through our extra
special olfactory in regards to cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabis terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to like position the chat and
the live chat at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't miss the- That's what I got
going on right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The viewers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to have two monitors, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I just have one gaming one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a long one, but it's just a single
one, but it's long enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can make the boxes small and still get
my- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So dry sifting, I got into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was washing first, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the summer in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a farm, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a property on the parcel where we
grew, and then we had our residence.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Washington, most houses don't have air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the summer, there's like two weeks
that are hot as balls, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And my trimmers, they didn't want to
sweat, one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two, I didn't want my weed getting
trimmed in 100 degree weather getting all
[SPEAKER_04]: sticky and finger hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I converted my washroom into a trim
room so I couldn't make hash, and I was
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of running out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had so much keef, and I decided to
see what I could do with it because I got
[SPEAKER_04]: motivated by Sam the skunk man,
and I got motivated by you and pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, man, I want to see if I can
make this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I ended up learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was happy I didn't have a washer
because it has so much keef, so much
[SPEAKER_04]: material to make into sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much, in fact, that I was selling jars
full of $35 a gram to my friends because I
[SPEAKER_04]: liked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know I was getting hustled at the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were definitely happy to get sift
from me for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be talking about hash
making here, I guess, now that we've gone
[SPEAKER_02]: through the entire panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone that I invited, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did invite Etienne, but he was super
busy with the whole new rec laws that had
[SPEAKER_02]: passed in Cali, so his dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it was Chris Conrad and his wife,
Nikki, who were the first customers of BPG
[SPEAKER_02]: the other day for rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we won't be talking about that too much
today because we're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about hash making.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what year was that when you started?
[SPEAKER_02]: What year was that summer of, Cuban?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first year I started making dry
sift was the first year that I won an
[SPEAKER_04]: award, which was what, 2014?
[SPEAKER_05]: September.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I started dry sifting around March.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or April of 2014, and I entered my first
cup in September with that haze,
[SPEAKER_04]: dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the haze was just powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it's my son's middle name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Haze is a cool one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had two strains at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had an OG that melted so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm always conflicted if I make the
right decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a third, so I'm happy with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had an OG that was super white,
terpy, melty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really melty for sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is that you can smoke that
shit all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't get tired, and you wouldn't
get too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what would happen with the haze is,
have you ever looked out the window
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for the cops and stuff after
smoking or been hammered on the couch just
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking and daydreaming and shit?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what would happen to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, man, I want to get these
judges.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want their heart to feel like it's about
to rip out of their chest when they take a
[SPEAKER_04]: dab of this stuff because they're going to
be smoking so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And got your boy in their third place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the haze is no joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised that if they had any real
hash aficionado-ness in them, they would
[SPEAKER_02]: be like, holy shit, this is the first
place right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I love the racing heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you told that story, I pictured my
friend Miles flushing all his shit down
[SPEAKER_02]: the toilet because cops pulled someone
over in a Safeway parking lot across the
[SPEAKER_02]: street from where he lived after puffing
the haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just like, oh, oh, dumping his shit
down the toilet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawthorne Street, Portland, for those that
know, know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at first I wasn't getting third because
it just looked like some regular hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the only dry sift entry out of 30
entries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a recreational one and a
medical one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nobody knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just thought it was some hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it took a connoisseur to be like,
guys, I don't think this is water hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: This might be dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they started considering it as dry sift
and it elevated up in points, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed there was a big appreciation for
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it had not been introduced
into the US market in a competitive sense
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, they were excited to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had definitely been in winning the
legends of hash every year since like
[SPEAKER_02]: 2003.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't you say, Sam?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one year, water hash won by,
what was it?
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the clone from, it was one of my
old clones, but it was grown by- Oh,
[SPEAKER_11]: the skunk sleestack?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was a skunk hindu kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes, the skunk hindu kush.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, every other year it was dry sift.
[SPEAKER_11]: That took first place for- Dry sift is the
gold standard for most varieties of plants
[SPEAKER_11]: or clones.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can make the very best water hash from
it and the best dry sift.
[SPEAKER_11]: But also it's hard for most people to make
dry sift that as pure, as clean as they
[SPEAKER_11]: can water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's harder for most people for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all I know is Sam's been coughing on
it for maybe 30 years, which is insane.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I made my first dry sift maybe in
86.
[SPEAKER_11]: That year or the next year, I figured out
how to make it 99.9% resin heads.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what really changed it because once
you've had resin melt and bubble in front
[SPEAKER_11]: of you the first time, it's just like,
that's a sheesh.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard to forget experience,
especially even in this day and age still
[SPEAKER_02]: to this day, because most people,
they have to figure out a way for it to be
[SPEAKER_02]: either to make sense for their brand or to
profit for their company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either or, it's hard to do at just the
loss.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to actually- It's not hard to
understand why this is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you test most hashish in the
coffee shops, it's got less THC than good
[SPEAKER_11]: Bud Ken, 20%.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got less than that, which means most
of it is something else.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas you can make it 99.9% pure resin
heads and then it's in the low 80s of THC
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's terpene rich naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the first time I bought dry
sift from the gray area and I cleaned it
[SPEAKER_02]: up and it was like 13% heads.
[SPEAKER_11]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You live in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but I don't ever go to coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can honestly say I don't think I've ever
been in a coffee shop with you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say that it may have been
13% heads, but right here, Cuban,
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you even remember when you
gave this to me back in 2015.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Miami Hayes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is like the first day that I
met you, that you gave this to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You better have a rip of that right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah, that's tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw Blue Ice had sent me a picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: He tagged me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw on that link, there's only I
think one little medal on it, huh?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, this is where it says third place
2014 Seattle HC High Times Canvas Cup.
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, I've been saving it all this
time.
[SPEAKER_15]: All this time.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I save a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say what you smoke with us, girl,
or take a dab.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, okay, I'll take a dab.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I like about sift is that so
some drugs, it's hard to see the quality
[SPEAKER_04]: of it visually, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of mystery stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like weed is one that you can really tell
if it's good or not, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Visually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you smell it, there's ways to tell
it's quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like sift is one of those too,
by the way it shines, by the refraction of
[SPEAKER_04]: the size of the heads, the smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in Amsterdam, they're not even really
down with dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're down with that pollinator spinning
it for like 24 hours before they take the
[SPEAKER_04]: material out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmer grade sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: I throw that type of stuff away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the farmer grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's step one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to remember, Cuban, that when I
want resin and I end up with 99.9,
[SPEAKER_11]: I start with whole dried plants that are
completely, completely unmanicured.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I grind them up with a machine to get
the resin free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my experience, I've realized that I can
get the majority of the trichome heads off
[SPEAKER_04]: of the strains that I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, by hand is best over the
screens, but I can break down a pound
[SPEAKER_04]: within like 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from a pound, if it's a good strain,
we could pull like 60 grams of sift out of
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Majority of them are like 30 to 40.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've noticed that over agitation,
it takes me longer to finish my work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get more green and things that I have to
work out of my final hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: What I've seen is that when I measure the
THC level before I start with the plants,
[SPEAKER_11]: the plants are about 15% THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: After I'm done working with them,
at least five, or so percent of the THC is
[SPEAKER_11]: still left in the ground up material.
[SPEAKER_11]: So no matter what I do, I can't get it
all.
[SPEAKER_11]: But once I do grind it up and I do get,
I can get about, from a kilo, I can get
[SPEAKER_11]: about a hundred grams of farmer's ash.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I can clean that up to 99.9
fairly easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're also, you're making like four
or 5,000 grams of farmer's grade sift in a
[SPEAKER_02]: shot.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_11]: It takes me like, well, you've seen it,
what, maybe a half an hour to make a kilo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, all I saw was about seven to eight
minutes to cover the floor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it was seven or eight minutes a
kilo.
[SPEAKER_02]: 4,000 plus grams in a shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh my God, this is
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you just have to train your resin
to, when you whistle, that it immediately
[SPEAKER_11]: falls off and rolls up in a little ball at
your feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all I know is that was one of my
most prideful moments of getting to play
[SPEAKER_02]: around with you and resin at that point in
time in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to just, just to be there with the
rake and being a part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over a thousand viewers right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that had not happened for a long
time at the end of hash church 1.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that we almost drove that train
right off the tracks, but it was good to
[SPEAKER_02]: take a little break and you will be seeing
all of the rest of the panelists that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've come to love over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to do specific shows where I
invite specific people who are really
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledgeable in the, in the one topic
that we're going to be talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: which today is hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think we're in the present of
hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a lot of conversation
really, I mean, there's, there's water
[SPEAKER_02]: hash and there's dry sift, but really as
Frenchy said, they're seething and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: both seething, regardless of whether you
use water to aid you in your isolating
[SPEAKER_02]: procedure, which it really does quite a
job in a quick way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, that there's something to be said
for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was a way to do that with sifting
that fast and easy, like water hash does
[SPEAKER_02]: to get that much of a percentage back,
a yield, I I'm sure that it would,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would exist right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it sure would, it would be nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question for you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rightness.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all aren't the melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: The melt is how much resin is formed
inside the resin head when you harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are a live resin or cured resin,
it doesn't change the quality of the melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is so much form in the resin head,
it's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you lose when you cure, you lose
terpene, but you transform them into
[SPEAKER_06]: something different too at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have those two peak, but have you
ever experienced plants that have been
[SPEAKER_06]: harvested too early?
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is amount of cannabinoid inside,
but there is no weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no resin formed inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the further you go from the peak,
the least resin there is inside that resin
[SPEAKER_06]: head, even if the flowers show like 20,
23% THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever experienced that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you mean like a really, like a really
low yield from a flower?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking about yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about a yield that has no
weight compared to, because it's been
[SPEAKER_06]: harvested too early compared to a plant
that is harvested at the peak of the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: When the resin is full of, when the resin
head is full of resin, there is a weight
[SPEAKER_11]: to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you mean that the resin is a different
size or just a different weight?
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we're not talking about different
size.
[SPEAKER_15]: Literally the weight, like how heavy it
feels.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you take the hash out of the freeze
dryer, when it's early, you can feel that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like the resin looks pretty, but it
doesn't have actual substantive weight.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not about the size of the head.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about the fact that like the resin
hasn't been fully formed within that.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have experienced with that firsthand
because I've been cropping at different
[SPEAKER_04]: periods and washing my entire harvest,
80 plus lights, you know, to, I've done it
[SPEAKER_04]: at day 77.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it at day 70.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've washed stuff before at day 45.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then let the entire crop go to day 63.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually saw a degradation in
quality as opposed to weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw better yields on the earlier pooled
on my strings, bigger 120s and 90s,
[SPEAKER_04]: miltier 70s, less residue on the nail and
cleaner separations, almost tartar turps,
[SPEAKER_04]: and just still a strong high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weight wise, I mean, do you have a lot of
CBG inside?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not exactly sure if it has CBG,
but it definitely has a nicer opacity to
[SPEAKER_04]: the, to the resin head when it's washed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like for washing, it's almost as if
the resin hits a peak maturity before the
[SPEAKER_04]: flower does, that the heads are all a big
size.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a thinner cuticle around and a
higher content of oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as the plant reaches its term for
flower, a lot of those heads that were
[SPEAKER_04]: once big, they become, they fall down to
the 70 micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: They become a redder shade, less melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that, for now for washing,
I've been pooling at day 45 to 50 because
[SPEAKER_04]: I just see way better results that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I came from growing 13, 14 week hazes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was hard for me to even make that
adjustment, but I see a superior product.
[SPEAKER_11]: And with dry sifting, I've always seen,
I like the plants to be pretty much
[SPEAKER_11]: maximum mature.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that gives me what I consider the most
resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I make it as clean as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I photographed your resin,
it was very red.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the color of Sam's resin
versus the color of Cubans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, these are two different batches.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've obviously made more hash than just
that, but this was very red.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I was most surprised at when I
first smoked Sam's hash and I've smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: both of them, they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Melt, Liquify, Beautiful Flavor,
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam's hash, the first time I smoked it,
it was like what Cubans said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I almost had an anxiety attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just couldn't believe how high I
got and how fast I got that high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd never experienced that in my life
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit was like an anxiety attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was like another anxiety
attack and then 10 more anxiety attacks,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you're stacking anxiety attacks and
you love being on the brink of highness,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're right where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, I'm honored to have a picture of my
hash on your wall, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, your hash is one of the most
beautiful pictures I ever took.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is your hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's my wife sifted that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually the Kimbo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And was it the Kimbo that you took a
photograph of?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that was Kimbo.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was two batches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I take credit, but you know
what?
[SPEAKER_04]: The real sift master here in our family is
my wife for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always the wife, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both soil grown and myself have already
propped out our wives today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may as well as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always the wives.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can honestly say my wife doesn't make
hash for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wish she did, but she doesn't.
[SPEAKER_11]: She tried it one time.
[SPEAKER_11]: She was okay at it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But she said, I know what I like and I can
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife doesn't make hash for me either,
although she has in the past as has my
[SPEAKER_02]: mother, which is always great to get your
mom whipping you up a batch of that full
[SPEAKER_02]: melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're putting in an entry into span of
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So dry sift and water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you'll be pleasantly surprised
because every time we went to Spain last
[SPEAKER_02]: year, remember that dry sift at La Calada
or two years ago, Sam?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_11]: Spain has made enormous strides towards
quality of resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not just bubble, but I usually see
half a dozen to a dozen full melt dry
[SPEAKER_02]: sifts while I'm in Spain, which is
surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 30 to 40 plus water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to remember Europe comes from a
hashish tradition, not a ganja tradition.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but it took so long.
[SPEAKER_11]: California and the West coast,
it's a ganja tradition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Span of this is an old tradition.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been happening a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I first went in 2003 or four and
now it's like, even Soma said it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said in 2012 was the first time I
started seeing hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: He stopped bringing his own in 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first year he was like,
I don't have to bring my own resin to
[SPEAKER_02]: Barcelona because there is great resin in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can name off at least half a dozen dudes
that just make fire every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful outdoor Catalonian sun
grown, reddish dark resin that still has a
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice awake sort of energy to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that narcotic thing that you might
think that red or orange resin means when
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about from a North American
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me, Cuban.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: What I was going to say was how you can
really see the progression of hash making
[SPEAKER_11]: is at legends.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the first year, what we really did
was we smoked my dry set, different kinds,
[SPEAKER_11]: but that's pretty much what we smoked.
[SPEAKER_11]: Within a few years of having legends,
we had 12 of them in a row in Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_11]: in Amsterdam, timed with the high times
cannabis cup, but not connected to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: What we found was after a few years,
we started having to get together and
[SPEAKER_11]: everybody started bringing their best.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we eventually made an informal
contest out of it where every year the
[SPEAKER_11]: resin got better.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, entries just got better and better
and better.
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally, the last year we had it,
there was 27 entries and we could barely
[SPEAKER_11]: even finish them all.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it was an unbelievable job and I
decided we needed three days if we're ever
[SPEAKER_11]: going to do this again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then we better plan it soon for
Barcelona 2018 in March for Spannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: because we need to do another legends.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need a three day screening period
before the night's announcement of the
[SPEAKER_11]: judging.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you think so?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we need a legends house that everyone
can come to whenever they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not an apartment, but a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm announcing it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do the legends of hash in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the legends of hash in Barcelona
in 2016 and we're going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can honestly say that the entries at the
legends of hash in Barcelona were
[SPEAKER_11]: consistently as good or better than the
legends.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would agree as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, for me, it's not about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, from the hash maker's perspective,
like Cuban and the other guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, the great gardener and all these
guys that love to enter these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's awesome to have a legends under your
belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I just want to be there with all
the people and potentially even like
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out a way to get sit down there
with the hubbly bubbly because legends is
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard to be legends without the
hundred year olds hubbly bubbly Afghani
[SPEAKER_02]: pipe that we just crush, you know,
grams and grams and grams of full melt dry
[SPEAKER_02]: sift out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Sam said the first year we were
smoking his dry sift, what he didn't say
[SPEAKER_02]: was he was dumping it in one and two grams
at a time onto a huge bowl of Afghani hash
[SPEAKER_02]: that was our screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This big, giant hundred year old Afghani
bowl that he was putting two grams at a
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, you could take a rip out
of this thing and then your lungs would
[SPEAKER_02]: seize right up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you'd be like, yeah, I would put in a
two gram hit of dry sift and then somebody
[SPEAKER_11]: would take a hit on the hubbly bubbly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I put in another two grams and
somebody else would take.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was insane.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the flames, I mean, a high flame can
jump a meter tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For doing it in our friend's restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That had a low ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Props to Simone for hooking it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about the dry sift, the distinct
difference, I guess, in between dry sift
[SPEAKER_04]: and water hash is the stability and dry
sift and the fact that even though it
[SPEAKER_04]: could be taken long, it still has a really
nice light look because of the way that
[SPEAKER_04]: the light reflects off of a resin here.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it greases is when you start seeing
the darker colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Frenchie doesn't like that word
grease, but that's how I call it,
[SPEAKER_04]: man, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it greases, it'll show the
essential oil layer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be darker amber, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: With in the California scene, or I should
just say in the North American hash scene,
[SPEAKER_04]: it has been a race to the lightest colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So water hash has been not with freeze
dryers, not only been able to achieve the
[SPEAKER_04]: look of dry sift when it's cold cured,
but when you have a resin that goes 45
[SPEAKER_04]: days, its essential oil is light yellow,
almost a colorless color.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more attractive gram per gram,
which is why I've also been going towards
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier pools on the material because it's
what the people want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely see people wanting a
lighter color nowadays, which is for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want great hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's great, lighter hash, then great.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's great, darker hash, then great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really don't have a big preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can even see from the hash that's
behind me, the majority of it has like
[SPEAKER_02]: nice amber color to it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me just say this, you know,
I also have working in a cold environment.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're always stressing to keep it as
light as possible because like you say,
[SPEAKER_15]: that is what the that's what a lot of the
customers want.
[SPEAKER_15]: What I think is important to stress,
though, because we have a lot of things
[SPEAKER_15]: going through the room and now with regard
to resin, that's just really not true.
[SPEAKER_15]: That darker hash, if you choose to pull
lighter, I mean, later, if you choose to
[SPEAKER_15]: press and therefore this, not even that,
even if you just choose to pull later,
[SPEAKER_15]: there's this idea that somehow the hash is
not as good.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's this prejudice toward lighter
hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I like all types of hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had very light hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had darker hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's this prejudice and,
you know, information spreads really
[SPEAKER_15]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_15]: So can you put something about,
you know, say something toward that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear that, you know, I see it all the
time that people just get lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: People almost always want to be told what
they like and thus thus grows the hype
[SPEAKER_02]: train.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the hype train sometimes has
accurate things on it and sometimes it has
[SPEAKER_02]: inaccurate things on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I have smoked incredible light
colored resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've smoked just as incredible dark
colored resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I personally and I'm not trying to
produce, you know, if if I'm in a business
[SPEAKER_02]: and my marketplace is that we want darker
or we want lighter, the market always
[SPEAKER_02]: speaks to what they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the people produce what they
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of it's always been like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What people want is what people will
produce, because it just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hustle is already hard enough to have
to hinder yourself by being like,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck what they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll I'll tell them what they want,
which is sometimes not really as efficient
[SPEAKER_02]: as just producing, you know, if you're in
a business for a market that wants a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see both sides really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially now in the recreational market
where your product is going to be on a
[SPEAKER_04]: shelf and you can't necessarily try to
market it and sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a lot of people walking
in and seeing something visually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at least in California, the lighter
resin is what they pull towards.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I sold with gardens that I'll be
working with, you know, I'm going to try
[SPEAKER_04]: to pull towards that forty five fifty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, do I have appreciation for dark
resin?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I started making for the first
like four years of my hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I've just been experimenting
with different pools and I wouldn't sift
[SPEAKER_04]: anything that hasn't been flowered to full
maturity.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But water hashes just it's easier to make
a different product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you do things that are impossible
to be done by hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: The diversity of the resin itself is as
diverse as the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have seen plants that offer milky resin
at three weeks were rejuvenated and never
[SPEAKER_06]: did amber.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like you cannot judge truly the
rightness of the resin head by the color.
[SPEAKER_06]: But since a resin head is made like a
fruit, it falls at maturity.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's made like a fruit to fall at
maturity.
[SPEAKER_06]: When the hypers of the hypers just fall by
itself, like Sam was saying, when you
[SPEAKER_06]: collect what just fall, through the drying
and then the harder you shake,
[SPEAKER_06]: the lower the maturity of the resin,
the lower the ripeness.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ripest fruit would fall as soon as you
shake a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you shake a little bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the second level of brown and so
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of the way it's structurally made,
literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how Reinhardt's original machine
was designed, the triple extract,
[SPEAKER_02]: extractor, ice cold extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came up with this thing, I think in
1980, showed up at the cup and first or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 97.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it was 97.
[SPEAKER_02]: He showed up at the cannabis cup and made
a little deal with Mila about the ice cold
[SPEAKER_02]: extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a machine that really was
like a brewer, a five gallon brewer with a
[SPEAKER_02]: triangular base.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it came with a glass collector.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so his design was really to
centrifugally spin with a linear actuator
[SPEAKER_02]: and get the resin, only the most mature
resins to fall, and then collect them in a
[SPEAKER_02]: single screen, rather than to separate
them out like isolator bags and bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen it in action, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vern, I did here in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've used it as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we know today as ice water sealing or
extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty amazing to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is truly the ancestor of it as well,
because it was a friend of ours,
[SPEAKER_02]: Elden, who was sitting on Mila's couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he saw that machine, he came up with
the isolator bags right then and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said two five gallon buckets with a
five gallon screen bag with a screen
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the same concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was next to Mark Rose, my current
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mark Rose came up with the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so between Elden and Mark and Mila,
the isolator company was born.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was only a few months later that I
would start bubble bags based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: isolator bags that I had seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was definitely the true ancestor.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're so deeper than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That machine didn't push the knowledge of
the sieving to its depths.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other group used sieving and could
separate the process of agitation and
[SPEAKER_06]: sieving in a bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the beauty of it, truly,
that depth of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and the travel ease of it,
like throwing those in your backpack or
[SPEAKER_02]: your pocket, for that matter, and just
like heading off into the mountains to go
[SPEAKER_02]: make some hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice and portable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what else should we be talking about
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: The future of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to hear what everyone thinks will
be the future of hash, but we can wait a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say we got a good 40 more minutes to
still talk about what you're learning from
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the methods that you're doing,
whether it's water hash or dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got little tips that you've
learned along the way or little things
[SPEAKER_02]: that you feel are important, I definitely
have a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: I share them all the time, try to anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: One big one for water hash is that when
you're sieving water hash, the talent in
[SPEAKER_02]: that moment is knowing how much moisture
to leave in the small puck before going
[SPEAKER_02]: right to a sieve if you don't want to be
forced into it, self-pressing itself and
[SPEAKER_02]: having to microplane, which rips open the
heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some of us, we don't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not judging those that like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: By all means, do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one more option that you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the beauty of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so learning how much water to leave
present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by that is low quality
bubble, anything under four star,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can almost like squeeze water out of
that thing and it you'll still see
[SPEAKER_02]: beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for high grade resin, you can't touch
the patty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can only really be wicked from the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you wick too much water out of a
really high grade resin and you're in an
[SPEAKER_02]: environment that say not very cold,
but much warmer than it should be,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe over 70 degrees Fahrenheit or 80,
yeah, 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the resin can
[SPEAKER_02]: start self-pressing and then it just won't
see nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't break up like sand and fall nice
and evenly on whatever surface you choose
[SPEAKER_02]: to drop it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of a little tip that I
would share.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone else has one they want to share,
by all means, step up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's funny because sieving a patty
is almost like an art.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, and every resin is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some resin is a dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sieve a thousand grams after
wicking that patty and it will be like a
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 minute, 20 minute process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other resin, well, the dryer gets,
it becomes like almost harder where you
[SPEAKER_04]: really have to work the spoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes with the greasiest,
terpiest of resin, if you don't have the
[SPEAKER_04]: coldest area to wick on and you're forced
to take out the microplane and I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: like using the microplane very much,
but sometimes it has to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dank Dutchess wanted for me to talk about
drying.
[SPEAKER_04]: She asked me if I freeze dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't freeze dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use a AI oven with a cold trap in line
and a vacuum pump in a room that is cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these AIs aren't even plugged in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wick my patties on the dryer drying pads
with a lot of paper towels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I use a room that is about 40 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: My cold surface is above freezing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my patties don't get frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they freeze, it's almost as bad as them
greasing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to always keep them just cold
and stable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can hit them with the strainer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make layers on these AI oven trays
with paper towel and parchment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll see the hash onto there and it
doesn't have to be thin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sieve it pretty thick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll pull it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what happens is at a cold temperature,
about 45 degrees, the moisture escapes the
[SPEAKER_04]: hash as a vapor gas and it'll run through
the cold trap.
[SPEAKER_04]: A cold trap is a device that has,
it's like a bucket on a bucket type of
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The inside one has a dry ice and alcohol
slurry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when this water hits that cold trap,
it'll freeze the ice of the water hash
[SPEAKER_04]: over and it won't hit the pump.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can visually see as the hash is
drying when it's done drying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also discovered that it seems like
I'm capturing these water-soluble terpenes
[SPEAKER_04]: that maybe would escape when hash gets air
dried.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know because I have never air
dried hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my hash still comes off super
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it gives me an indicator when it's
dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it doesn't come out like dry sift,
like a freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever sublimation is going on
between freezing it and the way I'm doing
[SPEAKER_04]: it is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It ends up looking a lot like an air dry,
but perfectly dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one day I sat down with Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had told me that he was microplaning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is like one of the guys that
inspired me to see my hash and ask them
[SPEAKER_04]: why.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he told me that some of the stuff they
were running in Colorado was so greasy
[SPEAKER_04]: that it would take them like two weeks to
dry on a rack.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had to break it down even easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I told him that he'd seen my hash
before, that I was drying my sieved hash
[SPEAKER_04]: in 18 hours, about 300 grams of 90 micron,
he was pretty surprised.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I stuck with that method.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an easy method to teach.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really takes some knowledge of,
like you were speaking wicking and all
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like an advanced drying method.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot easier to, now that we're going
into the recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this is what I've been dealing with
for the last couple of months is scaling
[SPEAKER_04]: my hashish production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've chosen that I'm going to try to
focus my scaling on water hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm trying to train people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of these people don't even have
much knowledge on, check on Josh,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the people I'm training don't have
a lot of knowledge on hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hard to explain to them what the
process is when things are wicking and et
[SPEAKER_04]: cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to make a transition over to
freeze dryers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't yet, but I think it's an
easier method to teach how to dry hash to
[SPEAKER_04]: a technician than the way I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your guys' thoughts on that,
on scaling hashish production?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll be easier for you,
yes, to teach.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that you will, like for me,
I always, the freeze dried hash just seems
[SPEAKER_02]: almost like an artifact of its former
self.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's so dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so like almost fluffy instead of
dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen good freeze dried hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I just prefer, I prefer the
look and the feel and the smoke of a
[SPEAKER_02]: naturally, you know, the way I've always
old school cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still will do both under my brand
because people, you know, I understand
[SPEAKER_02]: that people like more than what just I
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what my preferences are is non freeze
dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I suspect that with the vac oven,
you're probably able to produce a dry hash
[SPEAKER_02]: without affecting it the same way that the
freeze dryer seems to do with that extreme
[SPEAKER_02]: cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a buddy of mine that I taught,
I brought him from Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes online as El Daggy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I taught him how to make hash and we made
hash together for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he mirrors my technique and he was
curious about the freeze dryer and he's
[SPEAKER_04]: stopped using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he thinks that the process is
inefficient in the sense that it will
[SPEAKER_04]: freeze a patty and then thaw it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes about 24 hours or more to dry
versus the vacuum oven being almost like
[SPEAKER_04]: an accelerated air dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can control the moisture,
but I try to get it as dry as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like the look of like a fish egg
looking sieve when you have that resin
[SPEAKER_04]: that, especially when the resin has a nice
translucency.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hard to achieve something like
that with a freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think freeze dryers make hash that look
like a like fugazi dry sieve.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when it greases over,
it almost doesn't know how to grease over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like a weird grab compared to
a sieve grab or even a microplane grab
[SPEAKER_04]: looks pretty nice too compared to the way
a freeze dryer looks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Cuba, let me just say something.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, I can't fake whether
something will grease up because I press
[SPEAKER_15]: my hat.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I use the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, I know what you're talking
about, that fluffy look.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that fluffy look is not great,
but it's conception here.
[SPEAKER_15]: We do not at all go from frozen to thawing
it out.
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, that's what makes that fluffy
look because that's a mistake.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you're trying to do is sublimation.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going from it being totally frozen
and staying under a particular pressure,
[SPEAKER_15]: which is 4.58 tour to go into completely
into vaporization.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you make it into that liquid phase,
then your hash is fucked.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just flat out.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's fucked.
[SPEAKER_15]: It has to stay from frozen the entire way.
[SPEAKER_15]: So one of the things I've talked to other
hash makers about is putting it in the
[SPEAKER_15]: deep freezer overnight.
[SPEAKER_15]: That way you know, no matter what,
that it's frozen, frozen, frozen all the
[SPEAKER_15]: way through.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if at any point you get to the liquid
phase, that whole freeze drying process is
[SPEAKER_15]: completely done.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not good freeze dry hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because like I said, I have an entire
counter.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone who's come to my house knows that I
have a counter of a huge counter of hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just leave everything out.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have things in the refrigerator and
things on the counter basically to see how
[SPEAKER_15]: things are going to react.
[SPEAKER_15]: And freeze dried hash, just hash that's
wet in general, no matter how good it
[SPEAKER_15]: looks.
[SPEAKER_15]: You will know that it is not all the way
dry.
[SPEAKER_15]: It probably had a mistake in the process,
which people have not dialed that in quite
[SPEAKER_15]: as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I can't even see what that is.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what happens when you get that
fluffy.
[SPEAKER_15]: It almost looks like shade snow.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it feels very undense.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it feels a little bit moist.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because when you freeze dry, it's still
supposed to make that same crinkly noise,
[SPEAKER_15]: not with the greasiest stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: But when you dry hash, air dried it a
couple years ago, when it made that
[SPEAKER_15]: crinkly noise over the parchment,
your freeze dried hash is supposed to make
[SPEAKER_15]: that same type of noise and have that same
type of feel.
[SPEAKER_15]: If any way it feels kind of moist,
like you're pushing a little bit into
[SPEAKER_15]: clay, your hash is not dry.
[SPEAKER_15]: No matter how nicely it dabs, believe me,
it's not dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome Etienne.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was well said, Duchess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also feel that the freeze dryer is easy,
in a sense, to teach people basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to get what you've got
with your vac oven that you're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: more tuned in, then it just becomes more
like, just once again, it's know-how.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's simple know-how that is not easily
transferred to people that you're teaching
[SPEAKER_02]: things to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh, yeah, I know how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, do you know how to do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you do it a little...
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the freeze dryer, I think we'll
see new tools specifically designed for
[SPEAKER_02]: the freeze dryer in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those tools will make exactly what
Duchess was just mentioning a lot easier
[SPEAKER_02]: to happen than having this wet,
sopping resin sitting in a metal pan.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on, Etienne?
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy Hash Church 2.0.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, welcome.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm at work.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a new legal world here in California.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm sitting here, stickering and
packaging, trying to keep up with the fun
[SPEAKER_17]: demand of all the things that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I didn't have a chance to pop on
earlier.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to pop in and wish
everybody the best.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll try to be back more regularly
next week.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just kind of crazy here right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody realizes what all these patients
have been seeing for these 18 plus years
[SPEAKER_17]: at my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now they all want to come in and have
the experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're welcoming it.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have everybody ready for it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully those people are
purchasing hashish today, because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what today's episode is about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash, hash and more hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, that kind of leads us into the
future of hash right then and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of in the future of hash right
now, as well as the future of recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been interesting to watch California
learn from Colorado and Washington and
[SPEAKER_17]: Oregon and Alaska's experiments and figure
out what works best for us here in
[SPEAKER_17]: California.
[SPEAKER_17]: And fortunately, people are still growing.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's making sure that we have plants
available, making sure there's seed.
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, what I'm doing right now is
I'm actually stickering hashish because
[SPEAKER_17]: it's very popular right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's one of those things that's needed
on the floor.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yesterday I packaged bubble hash and
cartridges are also popular.
[SPEAKER_17]: People are very interested in all the new
things that are out there.
[SPEAKER_17]: So they're not aware of bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not aware of just what hashish is
even for the most part.
[SPEAKER_17]: They've heard rumor of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: They've not necessarily seen it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So then you come in and here's 40 types of
hash before you.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's to explain the different types,
because we carry the CO2, we carry the
[SPEAKER_17]: BHO, and we carry, of course, lots of
different types of bubbles.
[SPEAKER_17]: And different names of variety.
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, we've had the Duchess's
wonderful products in here in the past.
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you very much, you dank Duchess,
you.
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, Frenchy and others have
definitely come through.
[SPEAKER_17]: Would love to someday see your stuff down
here, Cuban, but I know you're a busy,
[SPEAKER_17]: busy man.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's just the reality of now trying to
figure out what the demand is,
[SPEAKER_17]: make people aware of the different types
of hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's literally it's starting at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, starting from all the way back,
thanks to Sam and everybody else who
[SPEAKER_17]: perfected the flowers and helped made
those available.
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, thanks to you, Bubble Man
for bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: As I was sitting there, I was giggling all
day as I was packaging yesterday going,
[SPEAKER_17]: he, he, he.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Bubble Man, for making this
product even possible so that people have
[SPEAKER_17]: it, know it, know that it's out there and
it's available.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because before then, it was a few and far
between to find good hashish.
[SPEAKER_17]: As you know, back in the day, it was
finding something that was black or
[SPEAKER_17]: stamped.
[SPEAKER_17]: Not many of us had Frenchy's knowledge or
experience of going around, rubbing,
[SPEAKER_17]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the majority of us found out,
you know, when we go to Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_17]: right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Amsterdam, you go to Amsterdam for hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't go there for grass.
[SPEAKER_17]: You come to California for grass,
but you go to Amsterdam, definitely for
[SPEAKER_17]: the plethora.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was talking the other day.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can get a full trip around the world
in Amsterdam from Nepalese temple balls to
[SPEAKER_17]: double zero to all the different types of
hashish that are out there that you can
[SPEAKER_17]: find in conglomerated areas that you would
have never thought were even possible or
[SPEAKER_17]: have only read about or heard legend of.
[SPEAKER_17]: There you could actually go into all these
coffee shops and, you know, find it and
[SPEAKER_17]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we took a lot of that idea and over
the years have, you know, perpetuated that
[SPEAKER_17]: here in California with our medical
industry, which of course, needless to
[SPEAKER_17]: say, is 20 plus years now.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now that we're at this new
recreational world, we fortunately have
[SPEAKER_17]: the Bureau of Cannabis Control,
which is allowing for BHO and PHO and
[SPEAKER_17]: other types of extractions and water hash,
which is key for the consumer so that they
[SPEAKER_17]: can experience as many different varieties
of preparations of cannabis as possible
[SPEAKER_17]: that we have currently.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thank everybody on the panel for
many years of their hard work and
[SPEAKER_17]: dedication to make that a reality for this
new public that's now touching the base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I also in your thanks of me,
I always have to give thanks to the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that helped and inspired me along the way,
which would be Skunk Man Sam initially
[SPEAKER_02]: with Sadhu Sam's water extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it don't bubble, it ain't worth the
trouble and really the inspiration behind
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to isolate land heads to ninety
nine point nine percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a thanks to Reinhard Delp,
who came up with the machine years later,
[SPEAKER_02]: like literally 10 years later from Sam
doing the Sadhu Sam's water extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten years later, Reinhardt would come up
with the ice cold extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be shown to Mila and Mark Rose
and Eldon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the three of them would on the spot
come up with name and sell the product as
[SPEAKER_02]: we know the isolator bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the birth of the bubble bags
just four or five months after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was in nineteen ninety nine when
bubble bags were birthed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the real difference in the
importance of why when someone's doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: product that other people should be
allowed to innovate and create that better
[SPEAKER_02]: product is because, you know, it's it's
it's all about hitting it with a full
[SPEAKER_02]: house of cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got lucky in the sense that not only
did I have the love and the passion and
[SPEAKER_02]: the olfactory attuned to cannabis,
but I also had the willingness to share in
[SPEAKER_02]: a highly illegal market in a not really
very legal place online that information
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures of hash and process and basically
making hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, in the late 90s and putting it on the
Internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really the beginning of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overgrow cannabis culture, cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those websites really made it
possible for us to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all kind of outlaws, but there we
were sharing our information, kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping that it couldn't be traced back to
us, even though most people were probably
[SPEAKER_02]: not masking their IPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was it was really a part of the
civil disobedience, you know, that fear of
[SPEAKER_02]: making us all split up and not being in
communication with one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the real damage that was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now, as we are able to network
again back then, especially through those
[SPEAKER_02]: websites and now today through social
media like Instagram and YouTube and
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook and Twitter, these are just new
ways for us to stay connected with one
[SPEAKER_02]: another, share our information and realize
that we're much stronger allied together
[SPEAKER_02]: as we are broken and separated apart.
[SPEAKER_17]: Speaking of Instagram, kick Berkeley
patients groups.
[SPEAKER_17]: They kicked out our Instagram.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have a new Instagram.
[SPEAKER_17]: So people, if you could do me a favor at
some point, if you happen to go through
[SPEAKER_17]: Instagram, go to Berkeley patients group
and hit alike.
[SPEAKER_17]: We would love to get our patients back.
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know why they kicked it off.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just random and we were kicked.
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, you know, the prohibition and
the fun that goes with the reality still
[SPEAKER_17]: continues.
[SPEAKER_17]: So but it doesn't stop any single one of
us.
[SPEAKER_17]: I see everybody here looks to be working
and driving on and making the future
[SPEAKER_17]: continue.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we drive on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming in and sharing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, everyone in the room has
Instagrams as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at one point, maybe towards the end,
we'll try to go through the whole,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, everyone but Sam has an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I have seen a skunk man Sam,
but it's not you.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not him.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen several skunk man Sam's and none
of them were me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But have you ever seen your own skunk man
Sam and thought him, I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no problem.
[SPEAKER_17]: He still denies him to in the mirror.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: The future of can't have hashish to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of it is dependent on the cost of
the raw materials.
[SPEAKER_11]: In other words, when plants cost $7000 a
pound for manicured dry buds, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_11]: make economical sense to make resin for
commercial production.
[SPEAKER_11]: When plants cost $100 a kilo for a dried
plant unmanicured,
[SPEAKER_11]: then the commercial hashish market would
take off both watershed dry sift and all
[SPEAKER_11]: kinds of other ways because the raw
materials are fundamentally cheap then.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you want to make value added products
out of them and people will afford and
[SPEAKER_11]: want the very best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's why you have a passion to
drive down the price of manicured flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: to teach people that they can grow field
grown cannabis with the sun and still
[SPEAKER_02]: produce six star resins.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_17]: We also saw, you know, as Sam said,
20 years ago, 20 plus years ago,
[SPEAKER_17]: that was the price of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: Here in California.
[SPEAKER_17]: But over time, that is now dropped to
where it's it's well to five to six
[SPEAKER_17]: hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_17]: Therefore, it makes hashish much more
readily available to actually be made as
[SPEAKER_17]: opposed to in the past.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was economically unsound, as I said,
and that was the reality of the situation.
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted to take $7000 pound weed and
then turn it into hash, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: only unless you were an exceptional head.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody else.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just.
[SPEAKER_17]: Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: True and awful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone's got us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Split on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully he's got one more little thing
to share about his inspirations,
[SPEAKER_02]: his loves, his passion of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the stories, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you got to talk more.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, I'm looking forward to the
next hash church.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think we should really dig into
a lot more of these topics.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, I mean, keep watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for coming out, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are definitely going to dig into more
of these topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone asked what the if I could sort of
tell them a little bit about what I plan
[SPEAKER_02]: on doing with Hashchurch 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, yeah, he wants to know the
direction that I'm going with the hash
[SPEAKER_02]: church in the future and the roles
different panelists will have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do specific talks where I invite
specific people not get too complacent in
[SPEAKER_02]: inviting the whole panel in over and over
and over again, which was great for
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashchurch 1.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's a little bit of what kind
of killed our vibe was that it was the
[SPEAKER_02]: same people talking every week that we
were just having a hard time even coming
[SPEAKER_02]: up with new conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, inviting new blood and people
that are passionate about the discussion
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to all the panelists
that are on the show today and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: panelists that have been on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any great ideas for shows like
definitely get to me and we can produce it
[SPEAKER_02]: together over the course of the week
that's before the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even mind starting a month before
and getting some shows locked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been doing it a little
differently in the sense of creating an
[SPEAKER_02]: agenda and creating a contact sheet with
emails and making it just a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never did any of this for Hashchurch
1.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit was like by the seat of my
pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think that it was such a great
concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it blew up for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So great that I would love to see
Hashchurch 2.0 do even do even bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, it's not anything without
all of you showing up on the panel and
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing all your great stories and your
perspectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every once in a while, if we don't see eye
to eye and we argue, that's okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's something that we want
to maintain and Hashchurch is not always
[SPEAKER_02]: agreeing with everyone, but at least
respecting everyone and listening to what
[SPEAKER_02]: they have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stoked at the conversation today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready to go for a little while longer
if you guys want to talk Hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should smoke some Hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what we need to do is organize
that everybody promises to grow 1,000
[SPEAKER_11]: plants, grind it up, make Hashish out of
it, so that Hashish will be everywhere
[SPEAKER_11]: with everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, you have the most unique
perspective, Sam, because you've grown the
[SPEAKER_02]: fields, you've grown the huge greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you've had material on a level
that most have not had access to,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you said, whole plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Browned up and just sitting waiting for
you to bounce over screens or to do
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you need to get done to get that
resin off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely hats off to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have had a passion and a love for this
that really kind of, I think that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the few people holding the flame
for a long time, especially in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash dry sifting knowledge and taking it
to the next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was really, you know, every year at
the Cannabis Cup, I can't remember what
[SPEAKER_02]: year I asked this, but I asked the
audience, like, how many people have
[SPEAKER_02]: full-melt dry sift?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people have full-melt water hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people have oil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oil was always the majority of the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full-melt water hash in the early days was
less, but grew as time went on,
[SPEAKER_02]: and dry sift was always Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the one hand in the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: There have been, oh, so Groen has split,
so we'll say goodbye to him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of people produce very, very
high-quality dry sift now.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's no longer uncommon.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you don't see it in large amounts,
and you don't see it everywhere,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it in the hashtag on Instagram
and see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's at least a few people producing
very nice resin and making it available.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt that when we're in
Barcelona this year for Spannibus,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll try to come up with some dates
maybe by next week for Hash Church to let
[SPEAKER_02]: people know, it'll be probably a two- to
three-day event where we just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe we'll finish it off with
the dinner and the whole ticketed thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the first couple of days can be
us meeting around Barcelona to just have a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice session, maybe have a house for one
day where everyone comes to the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a real good idea that the
samples have to be submitted three days
[SPEAKER_11]: before the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just always been harder because I
always chose the people who were coming to
[SPEAKER_02]: the event based on people that came to my
booth at Spannibus and showed me beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's either got to be harder for the
organization of the event or harder on us
[SPEAKER_11]: judged to the point of impossibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's make it harder on the
organization of the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyone else got some takes on where
they see the future of Hash Ishko and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe some of the people we haven't heard
from as much like Andrew and Jessica or
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Ladybug or Dablogic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that a lot of us have loud voices
and we're very like non-stop, but I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to give you guys the opportunity to say
more as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually like to ask you guys what about
collecting the non-water soluble terpenes
[SPEAKER_09]: from hash water after washes, because
obviously most of us are doing production
[SPEAKER_09]: washes and we have so much water left
over.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cuban, you have a cold trap, so I'm sure
you're collecting some of the terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_09]: With the bulk amount of water that we
have, what is there to do with it?
[SPEAKER_09]: What could we possibly do with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have all the frozen... I have all the
frozen... Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have the terp water from the drying
of the hash and I have a lot of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally didn't know what to do with
it because I put it in a separation funnel
[SPEAKER_04]: and I didn't separate the still terps to
an amount that would be worth spending
[SPEAKER_04]: time trying to extract it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I saw Tony at the Emerald Cup,
I asked him, because he's a smart guy,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, yo, what can I do with this?
[SPEAKER_04]: He told me that you can make women's
fragrance from the terps, from the
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrosols.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have everybody smelling like
Kimball, cookies and cream, OGs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I'm hoping that I'm going
to do with my ice water.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm also curious because like you,
I do have a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony, that was one of his first ins to
terpenes back in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre the conversation I had with Kay from
Trichome Technologies, who I guess maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: year into Hash Church, said to me,
listen, you should figure out how to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpenes out of the water from bubble
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be your future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of busy at the time,
not really thinking that I was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: focus on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I did do is I mentioned it to two
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned it to Tony, who was in Florida
at the time at a very high end lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he was able to kind of bounce
things off of some pretty smart people
[SPEAKER_02]: between him and them that he was able to
come up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he had Blue River terpenes less
than a month after that conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Horatio was the second person I
mentioned it to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kind of just it went over his head.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once Tony was making terpenes and I
called him out on Hash Church one time,
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, dude, I told you guys both on the
same day about the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tony's had terpenes since like two or
three weeks later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Horatio had them the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was definitely that Trichome
Technology Kay, you know, he's been doing
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes for a while now as well,
extracting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had Alexander Shulgin helping him
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure we're going to see more from
him in the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, things went a little bit
south in regards to me telling those guys
[SPEAKER_02]: about what they should do just in
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a little upset about them both
having terpenes on the market before he
[SPEAKER_02]: did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So apologies to Kay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely didn't mean to step on anyone's
toes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you know,
sometimes it's not the person that wants
[SPEAKER_02]: to come up with something and release it,
but it's the person who's actually going
[SPEAKER_02]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that hurts the person who wants
to be the person to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just happens the way it happens now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with things like Instagram and it's
like, it can happen fast with just someone
[SPEAKER_02]: stepping into the right timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They become the person, you know,
and it's people just got to respect that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just look at Rasen alone.
[SPEAKER_17]: What, you know, a few years ago,
we did the first Rasen episode over at the
[SPEAKER_17]: Hash Museum in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now it's just at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a whole Rasen section.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I mean, there's the squishers.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's every kind of possible outlet now.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's rather fascinating how things
can gather steam and roll forward rather
[SPEAKER_17]: quickly as you say.
[SPEAKER_17]: Progress waits for no man, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, particularly why there's an open
dialogue about it, particularly when
[SPEAKER_02]: there's an open dialogue happening and
information is being shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when we did that, Hash Church was
soil grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was number 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all like, maybe we could do
machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't it be cool if there were these
big machines with plates?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, that's all a reality now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an industry now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when, when I saw Rasen for the
first time, it looked like witchcraft and
[SPEAKER_04]: wizardry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't believe that you could take
half milk and make it something you can
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, whoa, I'm making edibles
with this stuff because I have nothing to
[SPEAKER_04]: do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should change my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big ups to soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: The one thing we haven't seen yet is a
continuous operation, Rasen machine,
[SPEAKER_11]: where you just constantly feed it and it
constantly produces Rasen 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a conveyor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a conveyor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some rollers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get the conversation going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone out there will be making it right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's happening already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear someone tapping away with a
hammer working in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit was legit.
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody just got the idea and is
patenting it right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Aren't you there, Sam?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's already, I already copyrighted it.
[SPEAKER_17]: See he's on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's interesting to see where the
future of hash will be, whether,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, dry sift will pick up steam with
new found methods that allow for quicker
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: If bubble hash is going to have a bigger
comeback than it's already having,
[SPEAKER_02]: or if oil is just going to continue to
kind of own the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to speak on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: With the prices going down in California
specifically, like Sam was saying,
[SPEAKER_09]: the cost is going to make a lot more
people jump on to making hash because even
[SPEAKER_09]: if the yields are low, the cost isn't
there anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can still produce, get a low yield
and make your money back.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to intrigue a lot more
farmers that were normally sending their
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff off to be ran with butane to turn
into ice water because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_09]: farmers I work with would rather go with
solventless and organic methods.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if it's cost effective, like it's
happening in California, then we're going
[SPEAKER_09]: to see a lot more hash, a lot more hash,
just almost, I would see it added to be
[SPEAKER_09]: competitive with solvent extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, or in some conjunction,
because to make water extraction really
[SPEAKER_02]: work, you really should have a plan B for
added value for the bulbous heads that
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't extracting through the seeding
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can make up sometimes 10% of the
yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a lot of heads to be leaving
behind, whether you're doing a plant fat
[SPEAKER_02]: extract and producing products like prana,
whether you're doing a chemical extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: or a CO2 extraction and producing
distillate, or whether you're figuring out
[SPEAKER_02]: another method, maybe a rosin method to
produce oil for edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, getting that resin off of the
plant after you've washed it is definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be sort of a key thing if you
want to have that added value make up for
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual potential loss that you'll see
if you just go from making oil to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: making hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the truth is water hash is much more
efficient at extracting all the resin than
[SPEAKER_11]: dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dry sifting is not particularly efficient.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope to see a greater demand for
non-solvent concentrates, but I still
[SPEAKER_05]: think that the solvent extracts going to
dominate the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just because traditionally
speaking, when you look at other
[SPEAKER_05]: industries, whatever is the most efficient
process seed tends to dominate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, let's face it, the butane guys
are putting out numbers that are just
[SPEAKER_05]: incredible amounts of oil can be made from
one person in a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe they have dual 10-pound blasting
columns.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to run a lot of material to make
those kind of numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, it's all about
economics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the price drops and it's more
accessible for us, then I think we'll be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to have a place in the market for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot of people, they do want more
natural everything now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a big push for health in general.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was reading somewhere that the
demand for vegan and vegetarian food has
[SPEAKER_05]: increased 1,000% in the past couple years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, just that alone right there
says that there should be a good market
[SPEAKER_05]: for us moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, did you want to go ahead,
Danktaches?
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually was actually going to say the
same thing that Drew said, which was like,
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't really speak toward VHL.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know so much about the VHL market.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the push toward health is something
that is a trend that's not going to
[SPEAKER_15]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_15]: So like was said, by natural devs,
once we have, once the price comes down,
[SPEAKER_15]: like, I mean, I'm a grower, so it doesn't
affect me like that because I'm not buying
[SPEAKER_15]: material.
[SPEAKER_15]: I grow my own material, and then I can
make hash from that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But once the price comes down and it is
much easier to actually make hash,
[SPEAKER_15]: because a lot of people don't understand
that making hash is not a millionaire's
[SPEAKER_15]: game, no matter what you think.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody I know who's making hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know a lot of hash makers.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like rolling in the dough.
[SPEAKER_15]: So when you're buying material,
you're buying really, really quality
[SPEAKER_15]: material, the numbers just don't add up.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I could totally understand why you
would take that super fire indoor and then
[SPEAKER_15]: make it into VHL.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was all about money.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if price comes down, then this is
something that's more feasible for more of
[SPEAKER_15]: us.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can get to the market more,
you know, turpier things that taste better
[SPEAKER_15]: and that are on that same level that
people who want that, who have that fine
[SPEAKER_15]: glass, want their dabs to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would only add to this in regards to the
difference of what Dr. Ladybug was saying
[SPEAKER_02]: in regards to the difference between the
oil yields and the bubble hash yields,
[SPEAKER_02]: the real, real difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've told a lot of my friends that
have preference in oil that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have a preference in oil,
then try separating the gland heads out by
[SPEAKER_02]: micron size and seeing if you can't make
some oil with just 73 or just 90 or just
[SPEAKER_02]: one 20 and see what that oil is like
compared to, because I know as a hash
[SPEAKER_02]: maker, if I took my 25 through one 90 and
put them all together and I've ruined my
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 and 120.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if someone did that, I would smack
their face so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be like, I'm not a violent guy,
but I'm telling you, you put all my hashes
[SPEAKER_02]: together when a bunch of them are shidy
and some of them are really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're definitely getting at least like a
waft of my hand because it's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it with the naked eye where
the magic lies sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these cultivars with specific micron
diameters, and I'm not against people
[SPEAKER_02]: mixing them up and doing whatever they
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, I really love having them
separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always told my friends that had a
preference for oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, man, if you could see all those
schwaggy bulbous heads that you're melting
[SPEAKER_02]: off into your 90, 120 and 73, you would
make hash first and make oil with your
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some did, some did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That made my oil like five times stronger
than it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it separates and it creates a
difference out in the marketplace so that
[SPEAKER_02]: the normal everyday Joe who's buying this
stuff can understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is farmer's grade oil in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the full spectrum of all of the gland
heads from the bulbous, which I personally
[SPEAKER_02]: as a hash smoker don't want to smoke right
up to the capitate stocks and Cecil
[SPEAKER_02]: stocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a point I wanted to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get asked a lot sometimes when I go on a
live stream, sometimes I'll do it to smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: And get talked to the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they like to ask me, Cuban,
especially now that I've been working and
[SPEAKER_04]: managing my homies garden and he's a
hydrocarbon extractor.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes by critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: They like to ask me, Cuban, what do you
like oil or hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, man, I got a selection of
heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you make rosin with the 45 versus
rosin with a 90, then you already know
[SPEAKER_04]: what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a totally different league.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was that literally, I don't know
when episode 25 on hash church was,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I bet you it was very close to March
because we ended up in Spain for Barcelona
[SPEAKER_02]: right after that episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were showing people, Jeff Church
and myself at my booth, which was actually
[SPEAKER_02]: Javier for medical seeds booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was letting me work out of a corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little mini hair straightener and
we were, we were making rosin and showing
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Urban grower, Remo had never seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had all these incredible people in the
industry coming over and learning about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And great gardener walked over and I had
cleaned a bunch of barb dry sift for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was six star dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was literally like 99.999 heads grown
absolutely beautifully and cured
[SPEAKER_02]: beautifully over the course of like almost
six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, we'll try some of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And DNA was there and urban grower was
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Kyle Cushman or some high
times guys were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just like squishing out that
six star dry sift was insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we wrapped it in the screen,
just with our hands, it started dripping
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the screen just with our hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that shit was insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole movie right now in
California is where I see it mostly,
[SPEAKER_04]: but now people are pressing the best hash
that they can get into rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because they think it's that much
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me as a hash guy, at first I think
it's crazy until you see the type of rosin
[SPEAKER_04]: that these guys are making.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like stupid fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be able to press a six star in a
production sense and then gram out what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're making and make any sort of profit
is crazy as hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to people like the rosin
brothers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_11]: And do you think that if you have 99.9%
resin heads and you squash it and you make
[SPEAKER_11]: rosin, do you think the rosin is really
significantly any better at all?
[SPEAKER_11]: And can it be preserved as good as the dry
sift?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think that it would be any
better if you're asking me, because I love
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking hash and it's raw form.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm happy with it, but there are people
that believe that just the waxy layer of
[SPEAKER_04]: the head enough being able to separate
that from the essential oil and purify it
[SPEAKER_04]: that much further.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll take that step because to them
they do believe that it is a better
[SPEAKER_04]: quality smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do it at the right temperatures,
it's almost as if per gram and per weight,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're concentrating the THC and the turps
and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would just smoke the dry sift
myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like dry sift better.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never had anything I like better,
but if somebody thinks they can take my
[SPEAKER_11]: best dry sift and make it into rosin
that's better, I want to try it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm jumping on a plane.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on another note, going back a little
bit on production costs, there already are
[SPEAKER_04]: farms that are producing fresh frozen at
about a $50 per unit cost for 2200 grams
[SPEAKER_04]: frozen like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at that price, now it might not
be the best material to wash and make six
[SPEAKER_04]: star, but for a hydrocarbon extractor,
they're able to buy that material and
[SPEAKER_04]: bring down their wholesale price and hit
the market with a decent product.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it kind of not only destabilizes
everything, but it makes it hard to
[SPEAKER_04]: compete, I think, with hash, because you
can't do that with hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be hard, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, one of the futures of hashish will
be automated processing, where you take
[SPEAKER_11]: dried plants, you put them in a machine,
it grinds them up, and then has the
[SPEAKER_11]: ability to separate the resin to 99.9 with
little or no loss of any of the resin
[SPEAKER_11]: heads.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll all be replaced by robots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bro, I went to a facility on Friday,
and these guys, they're bigger than life,
[SPEAKER_04]: like huge, awesome indoor growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the way they scaled this quality
was mind boggling to me as a grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, all right, props.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm walking their stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have like this area with like 70
trimmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It almost looks like a classroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: People with their heads down on the trim
bins.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I walked to another room,
and they just have shelves of trimming
[SPEAKER_04]: keef.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was a machine that you could just
dump that raw keef into it, and it could
[SPEAKER_04]: make you hash, the guy that made that
machine would be rich as hell,
[SPEAKER_04]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That has to be a solution for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder how much keef is sitting on
shelves from big trimming operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'll tell you, back in the day,
they just used to like not even make it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but throw it away with the trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in Florida, we threw away all our
trim, until I figured out I could get like
[SPEAKER_04]: a panty hose and do some sort of keefing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little ghetto, but it worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, man, I got to get going.
[SPEAKER_04]: My kids getting a little rambunctious,
probably going to go out to breakfast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you guys inviting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming out, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate having you and your
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's January 7th, but happy Sunday
too, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you and bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank your wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank your son.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always good to focus on children,
but not here in Hash Church, because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to stick with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to stay on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear that pun?
[SPEAKER_02]: Stick with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good hash can put up posters.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what I always thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when I first saw Melty Hash,
I thought, man, I could put a poster up
[SPEAKER_02]: with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got real Melty Hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, damn, I could put like
anything up with this, like a framed
[SPEAKER_02]: wooden picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe my friend after he falls asleep at
night.
[SPEAKER_17]: I could plug a hole in a boat with it and
plug a hole in a boat with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I did one time get locked in a
bathroom during, I think it was one of Bob
[SPEAKER_02]: Marley's birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might've been the one I was
with you, Skunkman Sam and your lovely
[SPEAKER_02]: wife in the grill, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were at Bob's birthday concert and
I got locked in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little thing that I went to open broke
off of the little sliding piece of metal
[SPEAKER_02]: that keeps the door locked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It broke right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a match at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at the school of Sam puffing all my
bowls with matches on fresh greens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I used a match and I used some full
melt hash that we had made in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stuck it up against the little pin
and it just opened up no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, damn, I'm like Hash
MacGyver right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's like nobody even like it was
before social media, before you shared all
[SPEAKER_02]: the stupid shit in your life that
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like when moments were just for you
and not for the whole world, not for
[SPEAKER_02]: likes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although chronic says we do it for the
love, not for the likes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well played my friend, well played.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, got something that you want to share
dab logic.
[SPEAKER_14]: The future, I think, you know,
technology is going to be a huge role in
[SPEAKER_14]: that kind of upgrading our systems and
your production going, that's going to be
[SPEAKER_14]: able to compete with BHO and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think as we, you know, wanted breeders
begin to bring back that varieties and
[SPEAKER_14]: things like that, we're going to
definitely see a lot more high yielding
[SPEAKER_14]: hash strains.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like everything we run here,
we, we do all fresh frozen and we don't do
[SPEAKER_14]: anything that does, that gets us under
20%.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like things like the chemi Jones typically
do like 30% and the count lineage,
[SPEAKER_14]: the lineage oil that's hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then when we press that down,
it's probably like 24% oil or including
[SPEAKER_14]: the six star and the.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't press all your hash down though,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys sell hash as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: So a lot of hash, mainly 50 50.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, well, a rosin, but we make 50 50.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have about every pound, 60 grams of
oil or of a heads and then another 60
[SPEAKER_14]: grams or so rosin grade or whatever like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a firm believer on separating the two
and identifying them as separate rosin,
[SPEAKER_02]: BHO, PHO, CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are oils and you know, sieve,
mechanical sieve, water hash, finger rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are hashes to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my definition of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there seems to be quite a
difference in the two just from a
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective of smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of, a lot of hash, if it's,
if high quality hash typically melts
[SPEAKER_14]: fairly oily, consistency, it's not
necessarily like a runny oil or something
[SPEAKER_14]: like that, but it's, it's definitely a
gooey greasy, you know, like do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you list, you named a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you name a few more of what your
favorites are for hash making?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Gigi four was popular in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always pumped up 20% plus.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Gigi, you know, the gorilla glue is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, cookies varieties are great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Chem lineage, diesel lineage.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's typically what I find to be the
best as far as for fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of skunk lineage that, that's
around.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is actually very good hash making
material.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is large heads and very nice color with
a very psychedelic type high to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's, there's a, there's a lot
of varieties that you can go to,
[SPEAKER_14]: but you could say that most of them fall
into those lineage that at least are those
[SPEAKER_14]: 20 plus percent strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another one of the most
important factors that you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have access to genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to get into this in a
commercial level and trying to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: available and accessible for people,
the reason that people have a hard time
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it is a acquiring the right
cultivars and even be knowing what the
[SPEAKER_02]: right cultivars are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think now would be a really great
time for the left, for the few people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are still left on the panel to share,
you know, like dab logic just did what
[SPEAKER_02]: their favorite cultivars are that produce
not necessarily high yields, but produce
[SPEAKER_02]: unique cannabinoid profiles, unique
terpene profiles or high yields,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, whatever your favorite is of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also a fan of the skunk number one and
the sleet stack and the gorilla glues and
[SPEAKER_02]: the OGs and the where is my bike,
which is, you know, probably a 20 to three
[SPEAKER_02]: to 25% water hash and a 30% rosin a
yielder with very unique terpene content,
[SPEAKER_02]: high, high levels of terpenaline,
which is that very exotic sort of haze
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene that we all know and love.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you guys, Jessica and Andrew?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you, what are some of your
favorites?
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of stuff, a lot of stuff that we've
worked with is very like cookie,
[SPEAKER_09]: cherry pie, kind of those kinds of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: We get, you know, high yields and very
high quality.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of got popular with the pink
champagne a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a cherry pie and a GDP cross that
high yield and just tasted like great,
[SPEAKER_09]: but melted amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot of the stuff that we work with
is like, I feel like in that cookie
[SPEAKER_09]: family, whether it be like the sherbards
or any kind of cookie cross, you know what
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cherry pie, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Dr. Ladybug?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we actually also lately,
we've been running a lot of cookies,
[SPEAKER_05]: like cookie crosses lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also run this variety, it's called
THCbomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really like that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a, it kind of, the terp profile,
it kind of reminds me of those Flintstone
[SPEAKER_05]: vitamins.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of has like a chalky, fruity,
but there's like a funk in there also.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the resin is really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't, even if you let it go to full
maturity, it's still dumped and it's very
[SPEAKER_05]: light colored.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the resin is very stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really nice and like gritty.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when it greases, it'll grease like an
oil puddle.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I like that resin that's really gritty
and stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably though, my favorite terpene
profile came from this variety called
[SPEAKER_05]: KC36.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's white widow across the KC606.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a fruity, funky, it's like
really hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really like place it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of one of those, you know,
that kind of leaves you like, it lingers
[SPEAKER_05]: in your mouth and you kind of like scratch
your head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it just like jumps all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also a variety called Lucy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: We ran that this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: That, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lost the cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't clone it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't sure really what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like threw a couple outside last
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, and then that, unfortunately the
nursery lost the genetics during the Santa
[SPEAKER_05]: Rosa fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure if we're ever going to get
that one back again.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's two more stories in a row
that reminds me to tell everyone that
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing is caring and giving away your
genetics won't probably hurt you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about Sam who spent
millions of dollars breeding and this,
[SPEAKER_02]: that, and the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you just acquired your genetics
through gift, which I'm sure you probably
[SPEAKER_02]: have sharing something that you made from
that gift is not going to be the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to get it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least try to share it with a few
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to share it with a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you, I never lose cultivars
because of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always the same story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Congo I had is dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God I gave it to 47 people.
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason I have TJ seeds right now is
because that wonderful man spread his
[SPEAKER_17]: genetics and love around and he lost
everything in the fire.
[SPEAKER_17]: And fortunately people had it and gave
back to him.
[SPEAKER_17]: Otherwise I wouldn't have some of the
seeds I have on the floor right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got a lot of seeds given back to him
because he gave away so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hello, sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_17]: The love comes back always.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm kind of the anomaly though,
if when you're going back talking about
[SPEAKER_17]: the hash, because ever since I did bubble
hash back in the late nineties,
[SPEAKER_17]: it was actually my tattoo here is of the
flow.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was my favorite genetic and it was one
of those.
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately that got lost along the way,
but I literally brought it in and laid it
[SPEAKER_17]: on the butt on the thing and my tattoo
artist drew it on me and it was just one
[SPEAKER_17]: of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_17]: But ever since then I'm a sinner to you
bubble man because I've kind of always
[SPEAKER_17]: taken my bubble and I put it in a grinder
and I grind it all together and I press it
[SPEAKER_17]: all together.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love the different flavors for me.
[SPEAKER_17]: I go for effect.
[SPEAKER_17]: So for me, for my medical condition,
I like the full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've kind of always have then repressed
my water hash back into my own hash,
[SPEAKER_17]: which is of course needless to say is full
milk, but I get the full spectrum of need
[SPEAKER_17]: that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_17]: I also do the same thing with my BHO.
[SPEAKER_17]: I take all my BHOs that I get,
of course I get it here for BPG and
[SPEAKER_17]: they're all tested.
[SPEAKER_17]: So they're clean and I put them in a
little oven at 120 degrees Fahrenheit and
[SPEAKER_17]: I literally put them in a little autoclave
and I mix them all together.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so again, I get the full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_17]: I get some funky flavors as they blend
together.
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, it's not so much for me for
flavor as much as it is for the effect for
[SPEAKER_17]: my medical condition.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have go for syndrome and I have nerve
issues.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got chronic pain and all kinds of
things that I deal with.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do love the individual flavors.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, Dank Dutch has had some
beautiful stuff come through lately and it
[SPEAKER_17]: was absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I love again, the different flavors,
but for in the end, I still kind of mix it
[SPEAKER_17]: all together, you know, because that just
works for me and I respect you.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I won't when I'm with you,
I make sure that it is separated into the
[SPEAKER_17]: individuals so that I don't share my mud
with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I puff your mud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I puff your mud, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, you remind me of my old
buddy, David Esau, from like hockey when
[SPEAKER_02]: we were 11 years old showing me about the
swamp water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like all the individual
tastes, but I'm really more about the
[SPEAKER_02]: effect of bouncing off the walls from all
the different sugars that are in this
[SPEAKER_02]: drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Root beer, ginger ale, Coca-Cola,
Orange Crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, probably wasn't good for my teeth,
but you brought me back Etienne.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Flo was the bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was also Breeder Steve's favorite
plant back in the day when he was growing
[SPEAKER_02]: in Lugano, Switzerland in 2003,
2004.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had some incredible flow genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Props to DJ Short for making that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it was a real mutant.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know that it exists anymore,
but if it ever does, I really want it
[SPEAKER_17]: again.
[SPEAKER_17]: I loved it so much.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the bud that I grew is the one that's
on my arm.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I grew it and it grew wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it made beautiful water hash because I
had the original machine before your bags.
[SPEAKER_17]: I had one of the original isolators back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was challenging.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you had to always automatically clean
it out because as people who have dealt
[SPEAKER_17]: with bubble know, do not let your water
sit.
[SPEAKER_17]: We all know the sin that happens if
somebody, anybody accidentally let their
[SPEAKER_17]: water sit with some time in the stink
nastiness that you have to deal with that
[SPEAKER_17]: toxic.
[SPEAKER_17]: What would you call that that transpires?
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it tent funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like lending your tent to your
asshole bro that never dried it out,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he just wrapped it up and put it in
the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then gave it back to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it the tent funk, not to be
confused with the funk from the West
[SPEAKER_02]: coast, but the tent funk, it's no bueno.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happens to bubble bags and it'll
pass on to your hash each and every batch
[SPEAKER_02]: you make.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's one of the like deadly
sins against thy hash maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thou shalt not lend thy bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thou shalt not put my fucking bubble bags
away wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot like sharing used condoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is the most disturbing thing
that anyone said on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course it has to be skunk man,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: We accept you for all that you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is definitely, definitely made my
skin crawl.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Sam, when did that happen?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I tried to avoid it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, but you brought it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just, oh my gosh, that was
shocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think first it was shocking that I was
looking right at the Duchess and I saw her
[SPEAKER_02]: expression change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, oh no, like I'm
embarrassed for all men everywhere,
[SPEAKER_15]: but not really.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've done this before.
[SPEAKER_15]: You remember the last time I was here,
it was just like, size matters.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to delve into that,
but you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everyone would rather have a bigger
piece of hash than a smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_15]: That is exactly it.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's exactly what I was going for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know my hash never runs out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm talking about hash 100%,
which I probably should take a little rip
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I don't know, I feel pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did three hours and 20 minutes so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone has anything else they want to
really for sure mention and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: by all means now would be a great time to
step up to the plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a conversation that you want
brought up.
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I have to say is the future of
hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are the future of hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: We will make the future of hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: All of us together, all of our ideas and
it's going to happen and it's going to get
[SPEAKER_11]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that is very well said, Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say the youth myself,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are the youth if they can't stand on
the shoulders of giants, which we have
[SPEAKER_02]: been lucky enough to do and some of us
have been lucky enough to offer to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: shoulders to stand on like Sam and other
great hashish aficionados over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we celebrate at Legends of
Hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We celebrate legends of past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we were never
celebrating ourselves at Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was never an option unless one of us
dies off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was always celebrating the true
legends of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, maybe wouldn't it be a
cool thing to read one of those cards if
[SPEAKER_02]: we had access to it, Sam?
[SPEAKER_18]: Like the gardens of Kaffur or something.
[SPEAKER_18]: Which one do I have?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the gardens of Kaffur.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'll read that real quick and
that's how we'll finish off Hash Church
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was from Legends of Hash Roman
numeral 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to be confused with the iPhone,
but it's the Legends of Hash 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the 10 year anniversary and it
was the garden of Kaffur.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green plant which grows in the gardens
of Kaffur replaces in our hearts the
[SPEAKER_02]: effects of old and noble wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 12th century Cairo, the favorite
meeting place for the hashish connoisseurs
[SPEAKER_02]: was the legendary gardens of Kaffur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Islamic law forbade the drinking of wine,
but many Muslims, especially Sufis,
[SPEAKER_02]: were great proponents of hashish eating
and its legality was hotly debated by
[SPEAKER_02]: Islamic courts.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the 14th century, conservative Muslim
leaders won out and came down hard by
[SPEAKER_02]: destroying Kaffur's gardens, burning
surrounding hashish field and starving out
[SPEAKER_02]: the farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shops and cafes selling hashish were
closed and the owners hunted down and
[SPEAKER_02]: killed, but hashish use still continued.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1378, the frustrated Cairo government
forced all known hashish users into the
[SPEAKER_02]: main square where soldiers wrenched out
their teeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: A decade later, hashish eating still
thrived in Egypt as it had become too much
[SPEAKER_02]: a part of the Arab way of life to be
forsaken.
[SPEAKER_02]: May the gardens of Kaffur serve as an
ancient reminder that cannabis prohibition
[SPEAKER_02]: will never succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me this green plant from the gardens
of Kaffur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a wrap, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for being a part of Hash
Church 2.0, the past, the present and the
[SPEAKER_02]: future of hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do it again soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have a lot more conversations
about hashish so you guys will all be
[SPEAKER_02]: hearing from me in the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, legends of hashish, Barcelona
28.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out, everybody.
Peace out, everybody.
