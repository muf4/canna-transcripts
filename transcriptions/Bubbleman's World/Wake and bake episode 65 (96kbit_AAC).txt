good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we ready to rock here guys a
little bit of a wake and bake I've got my
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss perk I want to give a shout out to
the Dizzle Mr. Nate Dizzle Always taking
[SPEAKER_00]: care of me with this beautiful beautiful
last of the hand box the hand spun.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a lathe after this so I Did see the
Leafley article about hash church subcool
[SPEAKER_00]: in the grow to brown to table very very
cool Very nice to see Glad that some
[SPEAKER_00]: people are receptive
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need some cleaner, I would say that
the price is reasonable the guy's good the
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner is great and It's worth purchasing
honestly go support the guy's company go
[SPEAKER_00]: spend ten bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth it
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting a little bit of a mix of rosin
here
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 there you go Well within your reach
yummy yummy whoops Dropping torches
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping torches, you know, I lost the
bottom on this thing and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly falls over probably best to
just leave on its side luckily all it fell
[SPEAKER_00]: on was One of my old bangers He PA We're
still waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, our license never came in
in the first 12 that was received I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: some pretty big players were were
involved, but we're still hoping on
[SPEAKER_00]: getting our second Application and we're
gonna reapply for the first one as well in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense we It's a group group that I'll
be a part of if they acquire their license
[SPEAKER_00]: to do processing for so The unique thing
about the processing aspect is is we
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves are not actually applying for
licenses The groups that we've created
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships with are so in the end even
if our groups didn't get Licensing I
[SPEAKER_00]: suspect what we would do as processors is
we would approach those who did receive
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing And we would suggest to them
that potentially we create a partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: So It used to be 25 on Amazon the first
time bubble man mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going down in price.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat no bat day
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been trying to buy some DC DC's
from Canada, bro, try checking their
[SPEAKER_00]: internet their Instagram or go to Amazon
Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that was a good one was a good one
Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody likes to hear someone cough that
much What to talk about today,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we could talk about dry sipping a
little bit I've been asked to do a one
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon video many a times It's really all
a matter of it falling together Having a
[SPEAKER_00]: spin that I'm comfortable enough with in
running and cleaning and and shooting the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing Because when you do these
videos, they really need to be done
[SPEAKER_00]: properly and simply I think what's going
to happen is I've been writing the blogs
[SPEAKER_00]: for The dry sifting and the wet washing
our top lab is obviously in California
[SPEAKER_00]: with Tony right now So I think the
photography and the video will be done
[SPEAKER_00]: there So I'll have him run the one gallon
the five gallon and the 20 gallon I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Skype explaining exactly how I want
it to be done and then that SOP that
[SPEAKER_00]: information will go on to the website and
then of course people who want to we kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of want to have it as Such that you can
purchase from the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have your own abilities You're
a home grower and you want to buy the kit
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to be able to make the best
possible hash possible We want that to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a reality as well and I'm sure Blue River
will probably even be you know doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of things like maybe potentially
selling the The fills which we make for
[SPEAKER_00]: our pens that are going to be released if
you've looked at bubble man brand recently
[SPEAKER_00]: on Instagram It said bubble man Trinity
coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the Trinity carts That were
designed by Gary from Omicron and the good
[SPEAKER_00]: people who designed the Hercules pen
cartridge reusable none You know not
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you just toss and throw
away and so that's coming here in the new
[SPEAKER_00]: in the near future Pretty excited about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually pretty stoked to get one and fill
it up with turps and try it out myself
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't believe Lindy Snyder did not pull a
license in PA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying drew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty crazy a lot of people applied
all sorts of people Supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Hercules is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hercules is what inspired us to want
to create this other cartridge that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be creating That's why I got in
touch with Gary The team was myself Gary
[SPEAKER_00]: and Tony and we created this this Trinity
if you will a trilogy the three of us and
[SPEAKER_00]: thus the Trinity cart was born and So
yeah, we're pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's It's inexpensive, but it's not
disposable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to we'd rather sell you reusable
Syringes where you can just plug into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge and fill it back up Rather than
puff a half gram and toss it and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna make our cartridges a little
bit bigger than a half gram as well Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's gonna be just under a gram
Nicholas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's gonna be about three-quarters
of a gram to point eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think point eight is what we decided on
All right, yes MD 73 in the house PK
[SPEAKER_00]: Brewer John Maddix sir globs a lot luster
burn chillin like a villain octo Tom and
[SPEAKER_00]: melty heads and Lois Lane kind of feel
like I'm getting to know you guys like
[SPEAKER_00]: here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a hundred and fifty people in the
room on a Wednesday at 921 and The bake is
[SPEAKER_00]: on and did you say that that will be
available in the US?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gonna be sold out of California
Tony will be moving those down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure through places like Harborside
Places like Berkeley patients group and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully a whole bunch of other places as
well And then it would be cool to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell them here in Canada If I can get
you know, I'm gonna continue to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes if I can sell them, you know 30%
already filled with a terpene profile
[SPEAKER_00]: then, you know, all you really need to do
is Dump that you know emulsified into your
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever your product is and then you can
do your own refills with them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just be forced to purchase from
someone else Yeah, me too Nicholas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to figure it out I guess really
in reality the state thing is Difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: right because you can't really cross
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all got to be produced in each
state and that's Yeah, the shirt the Terp
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar is going to be available for
Canadians for sure I'm getting it and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it up for retail for sure I want
people to be able to have it and try it
[SPEAKER_00]: and say they've been able to you know
experience it I myself want to experience
[SPEAKER_00]: it and so absolutely I'm gonna be making
that available Sounds good David Forker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming in Yes, sir globs lot,
you know, I used to have an emoji years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago on a chat room called true stoners and
it was my fingers holding up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of hash up to the Sun so it looked
like it was glowing yellow instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Closer to reddish amber color that it was
Anyway, somehow my friend stepping Wolf
[SPEAKER_00]: who owned the site He cut it into a tiny
little picture and he turned it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: little he actually did it for all of us
There was was tow who had a big tow truck
[SPEAKER_00]: emoji And we all kind of had our own
emojis, but let me tell you I was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: stoked on that emoji That was a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to say that was potentially in
like 1999 or 2000 it's going back for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't know when dr. Bob is gonna come on
hash church next to be honest I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: what I might do with dr. Bob is do a
private Seating with him maybe with one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two other people but Different than hash
church.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that whenever he comes on hash
church He's so out there that the
[SPEAKER_00]: panelists can't just not criticize and
critique what he's saying before he even
[SPEAKER_00]: says it and it's made me fairly
Uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not interested in having people argue
his perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear his perspective Afterwards,
I don't mind having a discussion but with
[SPEAKER_00]: dr. Bob You really need to hear what he
has to say and that can take up to two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours before it's done So if you spend the
first hour arguing with what he's saying
[SPEAKER_00]: and he can never just get it all out Then
you don't really hear it as the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be heard At least in my opinion the
way I want to hear it and the way I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to offer it up to my audience Yeah,
there you go dr. Bob is next-level yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think dr. Bob is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really really enjoy it Really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Indra's pictures for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always liked Indra's stories in the
beginning When he first came on hash
[SPEAKER_00]: church, he always told some pretty awesome
I love hearing about old Indian stories
[SPEAKER_00]: India and traveling and generally,
you know I love that from Sam as well when
[SPEAKER_00]: he talks about his trips to Afghanistan
and other hash producing countries of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world Both super awesome for sure,
but I just you know, and all the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: church guys are amazing But I just I think
dr. Bob requires his own You know two hour
[SPEAKER_00]: to three hour block of just maybe just an
interview maybe myself and him Or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two other people maybe Todd wants
to sit in on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always got good questions,
but dr. Bob's a tough one because You got
[SPEAKER_00]: to really Let him finish his thoughts
before you jump all over them and so when
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him recently speak He said listen,
please don't try to attack right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just listen to what I'm saying and then we
can have the discussion so Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I will I will I will Yeah,
I don't know if it'll be a morning wake
[SPEAKER_00]: and bake I'm not sure but definitely some
type of a show Exactly, Indra you said it
[SPEAKER_00]: dude and you know how we all are we're all
fucking interrupting each other on hash
[SPEAKER_00]: church like motherfuckers It's just our
passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know both times I had dr. Bob on I
can't it was Chimera one time and I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember who it was the second time but it
was basically like just constantly all
[SPEAKER_00]: Over him like what about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, this is I was just like,
oh shit You need to just be we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: just let this man talk I for one Feel of a
true like I feel truth when dr. Bob talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's a valid Discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what Spock trometer?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't we try not to be to become a
pissing contest, but we're all very kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of alpha personalities we've all been
involved for a long time and You're
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely right in the sense that we all
absolutely have our own insecurities and
[SPEAKER_00]: those insecurities Come up through the
show when we feel the urge to tell people
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know that we're Responsible for
this or that or that we are though You
[SPEAKER_00]: know when we when we get into the pissing
contest and I've been responsible for it
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure I'm not gonna lie I have
insecurities and I've jumped into the
[SPEAKER_00]: pissing contest For sure what hash church
is teaching me slowly But surely is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the that the platform is bigger than me
and that I sometimes just need to sit down
[SPEAKER_00]: shut up and look inward at myself as I
expect all of my panelists to as well that
[SPEAKER_00]: this has become bigger than any of us
certain that if we Replace the whole panel
[SPEAKER_00]: me included hash church could continue it
could it could continue on because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: great people in the Cannabis industry have
I picked and chosen some amazing ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness We have some incredible
panelists each and every one of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: special in their own right at the same
time You know if we all went down tomorrow
[SPEAKER_00]: in a plane we would be replaced quickly
and wonderful incredible information would
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to flow and I think that's the
magic of the platform and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's interesting It is one big trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you know, sometimes I realize how
much Of an inspiration it's had on so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people all over the world how much it's
helped educate people how much it's
[SPEAKER_00]: helping people educate the people in their
lives because they know the information
[SPEAKER_00]: but after watching all of this dialogue
back and forth and listening to it you
[SPEAKER_00]: become extremely educated in these
conversations and it's okay that sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: will repeat things and that will go into
things that we've already said before
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's an ongoing conversation and
certain people are tuning in that weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: tuned turned tuned in before so it's
What's that what would be sad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, yeah, of course us all dying in a
plane would be ridiculous It was more just
[SPEAKER_00]: like a metaphor of the importance of
showing that life would go on without all
[SPEAKER_00]: of us The platform itself is the most
important factor and yes us feeding our
[SPEAKER_00]: passion into it is very very very
important But I see a lot of great people
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see sub cools got his channel going I
see The gentleman with the round table
[SPEAKER_00]: Diago Dago All sorts of great things are
happening and it makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got an email in recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could check my phone because he
invited me on his show the round table and
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, I'm gonna reply and go on his
show He even wrote in it that he thought
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe there was some animosity and that he
had heard I was upset about him in his
[SPEAKER_00]: show Dago Yes, of course not of course not
and when he told me that he He was
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired by hash church to start his show
and it made me super happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome You can never listen if
what we we're a part We're like a step in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ladder hash church is a step in the
ladder And if we get to be a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: more steps, that's amazing and great But
I'm not connected to it if someone else
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out with the next amazing show that
everyone's focused on and paying attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to Wonderful, that's just great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, I can't I can't support
it anymore and You will see me on that
[SPEAKER_00]: show because I just got an invitation and
I don't know when the show is but I will
[SPEAKER_00]: be emailing him back today and Letting him
know that absolutely I'll come on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a plan What's the shirt
today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a Jesse Royal shirt and the
small axe If you are a small Axe Right
[SPEAKER_00]: small axe so Jesse Royal one of my
favorites in comes the small axe Check
[SPEAKER_00]: them out on YouTube got some great songs
Off the top of my head Jesse Royal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it modern-day Judas?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think was the one that really grabbed
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was up there with kabaka Free from
chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two were my anthems for a while
while I was in Kingston I would just wake
[SPEAKER_00]: up and listen to them constantly Jesse's
got a whole bunch of great songs Never
[SPEAKER_00]: been lucky enough to chill with him or see
him live at As of yet, but that is for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure coming Nice Mitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to see Jesse might have to consider
July 14th.

[SPEAKER_00]: else do we got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Kwanzaa warning to all is good
hotter the battle raindrops Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: modern-day Judas is my all-time favorite
this morning quite different from the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of his stuff If you punch in this morning,
it's a little bit more mainstream You can
[SPEAKER_00]: almost see what they were going for but
it's got a great beat and it's uplifting
[SPEAKER_00]: and I mean shit Maybe we could listen to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we listen to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to get in trouble Yeah dub
syndicate is doped big ups James Smith
[SPEAKER_00]: from the UK to the UK From Canada,
we got her on our money to for sure for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure for sure She's on our money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah can't get away from it.

cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you Let me tell you So what
else what else can we say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the shape-shifting reptilian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go I guess I heard recently that
the guy the the MIA agent Who's on his
[SPEAKER_00]: deathbed?
[SPEAKER_00]: announced that he Killed all sorts of
people for the crown for national
[SPEAKER_00]: security, whatever their version is pretty
crazy story You never know what's real and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's not real anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take everything with a grain of salt,
you know kind of just Listening to it as
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like the way David David Ike
who's a completely nutball and
[SPEAKER_00]: conspiracist from most perspectives but
one of the first things he said in his
[SPEAKER_00]: book was not to listen or Believe
necessarily anything that he was writing
[SPEAKER_00]: about but see if it rings true to you See
if any of it throughout your daily life
[SPEAKER_00]: rings true and unveil certain things and
There definitely was levels of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Silly Simon sly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 007 stuff for real Am I planning to
visit the island sooner than later?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, which island are you talking about
trichome city because I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few of them out there Well,
I never sold CBD that was Tony down in
[SPEAKER_00]: California I am NOT convinced that CBD is
legal to sell I'm not really willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: practice that level of civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sell any cannabinoids up here in
Canada I do sell cannabinoids or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: my brand is branded down in California
selling cannabinoids and terpene mixtures
[SPEAKER_00]: But up in Canada, there's no legal
mechanism for me to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have been unable to do so I'm waiting
for For you know Canada to allow extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can create extracts for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Have mines inclined from for so long
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was actually catalytically
altered water now Thanks to Mitch we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing and he's the one that would
have to explain this better than me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some type of molecular Manipulation
something's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're activating the waters of more
living water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe was the was The quotation but
yeah, we have it on one of our hoses in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica right now Mitch would be the one
to break that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome from rainy Scotland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually rainy here, too But today
it's sunny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually might go get my boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of driving out to the whack
and getting my boat It's a long drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie, but it would be nice to
have the boat all of a sudden It's that
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you know a hundred days or so
of it sitting out on The front lawn,
[SPEAKER_00]: etc being responsible Do you have a video
taking you through the dirt making
[SPEAKER_00]: process?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's Tony's information and he
doesn't share that openly and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really doubt him You know, it's a pretty
major thing The way he's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's of a high value At the same time,
you know, I Was all I show I've always
[SPEAKER_00]: showed everything that I've learned over
the years I've never kept anything to
[SPEAKER_00]: myself as a secret other than Skunkman Sam
secret which is you know, not my secret to
[SPEAKER_00]: share so it's it's easy not to share your
own secrets To not share your mentor
[SPEAKER_00]: secrets, but for myself, I don't have any
I share everything I just share everything
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be the good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how my business was built,
you know It made sense to just tell
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone how they could do it the best way
they could do it And then people would hit
[SPEAKER_00]: me up and go yeah, but can you can you
tell me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know some tips that you don't share
with anyone else And I'd be like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have tips that I don't share with anyone
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just share everything That's the way
it's always been Dab time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a dab it's a wake-and-bake
Wednesday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some friends coming in from out
East today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be nice to see those guys See
what they're up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my dad's a shattery didn't want to
cross That line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't think well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be legal in some states,
but we can all agree Especially that the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal law is for sure because the
federal law for all cannabinoids is this
[SPEAKER_00]: is illegal So it just gets dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing if you're protected in a
state It's another if you're shipping over
[SPEAKER_00]: state lines and in particular
International lines now you also have
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are selling pure isolate and
feeling comfortable about it because they
[SPEAKER_00]: go on Amazon and see people Selling an oil
that they call CBD oil and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping it over the border But that CBD
might be point zeros one percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the legal limit of hemp Seed oil
to have as a natural contaminant Not as
[SPEAKER_00]: something that they're actually it's snake
oil salesman.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really medicine They're selling
it as as basically like they're legally
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to have a little bit so they can
put it on the on the on the Container and
[SPEAKER_00]: write CBD oil and ship it and that's
pretty shitty Thing to do if you ask me
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's testing that at customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying But the guys who
are selling isolate are getting confident
[SPEAKER_00]: because of these guys who are selling hemp
seed oil that has Tiny bits of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant in it and they're snake oil
salesmen selling it as CBD I'm saying
[SPEAKER_00]: don't let that make you comfortable to
think that you should be able to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate over borders Over state lines and
over international borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be wary I would be careful of that
especially with Jeff Sessions trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: Nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, we'll be doing boat dabs we don't
boat wake and bakes in the very near
[SPEAKER_00]: future Very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Suspect I suspect oh Diane 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you absolutely can happy birthday We
are the same age you and I birthday shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Diane Born in 73 much like the
bubble man who was also 44 years old not
[SPEAKER_00]: today, but some days ago Yeah,
that's pretty much the way to do it MD
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best I've ever made was Best
I've ever had was my myself as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but probably the best I ever had was skunk
man Sam's I'd have a hard time Beating
[SPEAKER_00]: that that shit was from another planet
seriously Sift Kodak, it's sift Kodak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just feel a pump
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I can Ah
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Indra, I grew up with a French family
and French grandparents They spoke fluent
[SPEAKER_00]: French Around me and I went to French
immersion school.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call the sacred curve in Winnipeg,
Manitoba and I'll tell you I'm glad that I
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very helpful when I go to Europe and
I'm speaking with people whether in
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland or Germany or Amsterdam or
wherever Where they don't speak English,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they will speak a little bit of French
And so when you speak a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: French, I mean at least one other language
I wish I spoke seven or eight languages
[SPEAKER_00]: Just never really had the energy to put
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something I'll do as I get older I'm
not sure but I think it's a huge bonus a
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge advantage to be able to speak French
in Spanish Italian, you know other
[SPEAKER_00]: languages a multitude of languages over
your mother tongue So for me, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a huge advantage to a lot of pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that is a francais Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silly Simon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome props to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool I once met a sadhu in India who
spoke over 50 over 50 languages and
[SPEAKER_00]: self-taught, you know, he'd sit on the
Ganges We were at the Mahakumba Mela and
[SPEAKER_00]: he would just pull people out that he Saw
walking by and he would call them over and
[SPEAKER_00]: then he would speak to them in their
language if they were Korean or if they
[SPEAKER_00]: were Chinese and it was pretty impressive
to say the least at one point He said he
[SPEAKER_00]: had probably a dozen of us sitting around
him all from a different, you know place
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking different languages to all of us
and helping us communicate with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another Because we didn't all speak each
other's languages and it was just a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing experience the main I guess
connector if you will was hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were smoking Chillums, that's why we
were sitting with him The chillum was
[SPEAKER_00]: really the main thing that was going
around and then the conversation the
[SPEAKER_00]: dialogue much like these waking bakes
where we get together we have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis and Cannabis seems to
sometimes really create a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: dialogue amongst people Yeah Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool Indra.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever had Frenchy cannolis hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe I have had Frenchy cannolis
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep All right, send that guy that was some
chars to the UN teach him he said the
[SPEAKER_00]: chillum is cashed in Chinese Right he said
one more chillum we are making One more
[SPEAKER_00]: chillum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are making yeah, let's the combo flow
exactly I'm not sure what that's supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to mean theme park nerd, but I Guess you
gotta go bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you gotta go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry
[SPEAKER_00]: Love chars hate the tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah for real Chills um, I had a little
Frenchy cannoli hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks be man Yeah, I got to get rid of
people that are being you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't even give them a platform the
thing about social media Is is that you
[SPEAKER_00]: build your platform?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why that's why there's this
certain thing that you don't go and do on
[SPEAKER_00]: other people's platforms You don't go use
other people's platforms to spew hatred
[SPEAKER_00]: vitriol And and and negativity you don't
promote your self promote your yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: too much with posters and website links
and links to your groups and pages That's
[SPEAKER_00]: another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always choked at in hash church where
people will post like hey, you know This
[SPEAKER_00]: is my event or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like man come and start a conversation
Don't just post your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start conversations So there are
etiquettes that we don't do we don't go
[SPEAKER_00]: and fucking do weird porno links on on
people's social media platforms I for one
[SPEAKER_00]: love the fact that we've moved away from
You know large-scale websites where you
[SPEAKER_00]: could make a post and then anyone could
write anything they wanted to Because
[SPEAKER_00]: those things really take direction and
they they redirect the energy of which
[SPEAKER_00]: you've built this incredible platform
Whatever your social media traction is you
[SPEAKER_00]: build this great audience and then you
don't want people to abuse it You know
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly like the last guy who was
spewing racist comments that I just had to
[SPEAKER_00]: block out of the room and It's like what
the heck are you doing man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your order has already been fulfilled
Felix your order got sent out the other
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you your tracking number I have
to go into the website for whatever reason
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a disconnect there and we send
them out long Usually when I go in I have
[SPEAKER_00]: to click that it's been shipped and that's
why you're seeing that It is not shipped
[SPEAKER_00]: as of yet, but don't worry boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it and yeah 200 people there you go
Hey bubble man, did you notice any
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between regular THC strain and
high CBD strain water extracts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well other than the fact that you tend to
get a lower amount of the CBD at least
[SPEAKER_00]: from the cultivars that I've run in the
past not too much You got to hit that
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble when it needs to be bubbled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Can hear him saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me smile actually Vets do need
free weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised that the US government isn't
producing it for them.

absolutely go back to India Potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: the Himachal, you know Valley I Know I
don't dank nuggles.

Milana Himachal Pradesh all those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all like one beside the other you can
roll in there and Go hang out with the
[SPEAKER_00]: chief of each little area and make some
rub and make some water hash I've had some
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that I've sold bags to that have
gone up there and shown the chiefs They
[SPEAKER_00]: know about water hash and bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no stranger to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure And I'm glad that it never
took away from that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a sort of I didn't I was I remember
being a little wary in the sense of like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd hate to just change The way someone's
been doing something Do I have any Mila
[SPEAKER_00]: screens, I'm not even sure what that
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, why would I have Mila screens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Screens that Mila sold I have a bubble man
bubble bag screens All my screens are of
[SPEAKER_00]: my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard of Graham Hancock and
his theory of an ancient law civilization?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hanging out with Graham Hancock just
a month ago talking about his Theory of
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient law civilization with him
personally chase We both spoke at the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hemp conference that Salome
put on here in Vancouver at the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of British Columbia And yeah, he was a
keynote speaker and I have heard of him
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read his books from many years past
and would you believe cannabis was a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: inspiration for him to go and do all that
research?
[SPEAKER_00]: big inspiration to Graham so very cool had
not known that went saw him and It was
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyable It was funny because I was
sitting next to Chris Bennett and Chris
[SPEAKER_00]: Bennett and him kind of like bump heads a
little bit So hey, that's good to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitch get on those bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better hash rosin or dry sift Well,
that depends, you know for me the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution the highest possibility the
best expression of both bubble hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sift are my favorite Now if you took
both of those and squished a little rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that would be lovely too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put all three of them on the
plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always yeah Rupert Sheldrake more
Epigenetic resonance theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first read Rupert when I got turned on
to him via Terrence McKenna I also was
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky enough to meet Rupert once in my
life Rupert Sheldrake and Ralph Abraham
[SPEAKER_00]: never Terrence McKenna though,
unfortunately, which is really a bummer
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did get to meet his son Finn at a
psychedelic conference where I had a booth
[SPEAKER_00]: where I actually Oh, very cool Lois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Rupert's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved his books Really kind of opened my
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was interesting Theory and it made it
rang true, you know It was one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things that just rang true and then of
course fractal chaos mathematics
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematics interesting Ralph Abraham
fractal mathematician great in a book with
[SPEAKER_00]: all three of them Trilogues at the edge of
the West both with Rupert and Ralph as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as Terrence and it was maybe one of
the most inspiring books to me as a young
[SPEAKER_00]: person I was only maybe 20 years old or 22
years old when I left I read that book and
[SPEAKER_00]: it really really really Blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Finn I met Finn and another really
cool dude the psychedelic gatherings that
[SPEAKER_00]: travel around and have these little events
where the different people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: written books speak Etc are really small
small communities and you can really Meet
[SPEAKER_00]: some amazing people at those events I'd
say if one is coming to your city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely go hit it much smaller
communities Than than the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community for sure Yeah Any thoughts on
introducing regenerative land techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: to your farm in Jamaica may be a stable
and providing for Jamaican economy Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, Ian Holla.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely the whole nine yards I'm
personally not going to be the grower but
[SPEAKER_00]: you can bet your ass for the project in
Jamaica that everything we do we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to want to have some form of philanthropy
that goes towards the island and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that just Has been from day one
whether it's producing and helping clean
[SPEAKER_00]: and recycle fill potholes pay taxes build
schools build hospitals build other types
[SPEAKER_00]: of things I I would suspect that in the
success of the company that you will see
[SPEAKER_00]: Many things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's the only way that it
could be really Almost hitting an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour-long wake and bake that is true
probably gonna cut it short I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have a few things to do today,
especially if I'm Going to be doing this a
[SPEAKER_00]: long drive to go get the boat But thanks
everybody for tuning in I really do
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it and Mitch have a great time
at the event I guess that you're gonna be

sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might might be right around the right
around the Corner do you have any do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have do you I don't even know what that
question said I Think it's best to write
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole question with no abbreviation
sometimes if you want me to answer it How
[SPEAKER_00]: often does it Jamaica flood?
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not always there But we definitely had
a good one recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.

fields nicely Because we have such a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: area to put water There it is ancient
cannabis a channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hate us cuz they ain't us anyway,
