[SPEAKER_00]: the house and big chew and Ryan Axton and
One sub 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

Samuel's in the house chilling like a
[SPEAKER_00]: villain Alan Mota Juta.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Amelia Lavender Austin Bram the
island haze and small tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hit some of that island haze
What's going on everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of morning still 1040 here on
the west coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an exciting day planned out for me
I have not done a bubble man video in a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about these live videos
I'm talking about yes, Elisode 78.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about Filming with my camera
editing adding music having transitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so today I'm going to be heading up to
high integrity glass art And apparently
[SPEAKER_00]: team Japan is over there right now dosa is
over there right now and they are blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: up a storm on the torches that high
integrity glass art has put in and Super
[SPEAKER_00]: stoked super stoked to go down there and
film.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never met the Japanese crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never met dosa So I'm very much
looking forward to you know Just being the
[SPEAKER_00]: humble filmer showing you guys all this
beautiful beautiful glass blowing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be made and You know,
I'll probably see flab flab lives over
[SPEAKER_00]: there as well and he'll probably come over
for a visit But I'm actually heading over
[SPEAKER_00]: to high integrity glass art slinger will
not be there but boy wouldn't that be
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome and I'm sure with him building the
Facility the way he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think his interest is to invite
glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got beds for them to sleep He's got
torches for them to work on and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: great idea for his business What better
way to get you know to gain control over
[SPEAKER_00]: the pieces that are blown than having them
be blown in your own studio?
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado I think we should
have a big old Dry sift rip this morning
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get get busy with some sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dropped a tiny little bit, but you know
what we won't cry over spilt milk
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to pour a little out for
your homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, you know when I'm pouring it out
from my homie I prefer to pour it out in
[SPEAKER_00]: To my sapphire dish That's just me
[SPEAKER_00]: How balling do you have to be to invite
dosa and team Japan to your place you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be baller extreme baller extraordinaire

[SPEAKER_00]: I Have no idea Samuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so I'm sure he's been pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk to the great gardener very
often myself, but He's over on the Sun on
[SPEAKER_00]: the island doing his thing Where we got in
here where we got in here oh Good to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah bingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most everyone did but there was a
few who didn't and I was just kind Of
[SPEAKER_00]: bummed out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's uh It's always a bummer when you tell
someone you're gonna send something and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they don't just they just don't
receive it UPS didn't drop it at my door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took forever for me to actually get
to the store and pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Shit, I didn't even realize I sent it
UPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good morning Indra Good morning Pedro
Robles and iron wolf and bud Rich SDC X a
[SPEAKER_00]: dubs and Ryan Axton and dabs for days and
hopefully I always like to say hi to
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to say hi to everyone It's
nice to be acknowledged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you think let me get rid of that
real quick It's amazing how many messages
[SPEAKER_00]: I get and how many things come in on my
phone while I'm doing these videos It's
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I was tempted to do the wake and
bake from the ferry I thought that might
[SPEAKER_00]: have been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, what if I see something
really cool on the ferry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go live You know if there's some
whales or dolphins swimming around on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side, I'll film it with the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys get to see some of that
and Yeah, in the meantime, I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get The ferry is in one hour and 15
minutes And if I were in a car,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably be leaving soon to go and
drive and get in line But I'm on a bike So
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be getting on the ferry first and
I'll be getting off the ferry first and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the beautiful thing About being on
a motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a bonus Yeah, what new genetics
do you recommend geez I don't know I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: I There's a lot of great genetics out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the strawberry banana from DNA
and the Crockett boys is insane This og 18
[SPEAKER_00]: we recently made some melt with down in
California is absolutely insane any and
[SPEAKER_00]: all hay strains ghost train amnesia Really
any haze anything that's got that exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of terpenaline piney and
karyophylline mix is something that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: always stoked on For the most part
narrowly if yeah, I'm not like I mean I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke anything don't get me wrong But I
prefer the good narrow leaf Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah DNA's got some great selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about it from day one
since meeting those guys They've had great
[SPEAKER_00]: selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do great work and they're great
dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty easy to to support all in
all I've been hitting some green crack the
[SPEAKER_00]: past couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, green crack is pretty nice and racy
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Andrew's got a show to this Saturday
gonna be competing with Todd But don't
[SPEAKER_00]: worry because on Sunday, you know where
I'll be I will be on hash church and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure if we're going to be doing What
we're gonna be doing this week on hash
[SPEAKER_00]: church, but it should be pretty good I've
put the word out to a few different people
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll see what transpires and what
materializes Hey, very cool Evan got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: liking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah There you go, there's not you're not
the first one to do a show right after
[SPEAKER_00]: half It's kind of like being the string
cheese incident back in the day when fish
[SPEAKER_00]: was touring or Dave Matthews It's like
those guys would always go and tour
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally the day that fish had off in
between the two places that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling from which was brilliant Really,
you know that you've got a large audience
[SPEAKER_00]: that just came off of watching a great
show And then boom, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's a pretty good slot But there
are a few people that have definitely done
[SPEAKER_00]: that slot I can't remember the names of
the shows, but there's there's a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: that do their shows right after hash
church on Well, you know what sack it's
[SPEAKER_00]: called being inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't look at it as copying I mean sure
the the little insecure child inside of me
[SPEAKER_00]: might be like But who cares about that in
reality it's not copying it's inspiration
[SPEAKER_00]: what how do we we take steps in a ladder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how did the next step in the ladder
get there if the first step said oh you're
[SPEAKER_00]: copying me It's a It's like no I'm the
next step in the ladder and then the next
[SPEAKER_00]: step and then the next step and then the
next step And it's how we climb it's how
[SPEAKER_00]: we elevate ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how we raise the bar So don't look at
it as copying so much as keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Was not the first one to sell water hash
bags Isolator bags were the first bags
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone bitched and whined and said I was
copying I was copying I was copying well
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 20 years later I can assure you that
they all say bubble bags set the bar
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble bags brought the new brought the
new level so it's like It's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: inspirational to have new shows coming and
and and coming up and creating new They're
[SPEAKER_00]: fitting and filling gaps that are there
that the the maybe you know when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: the first in anything There's gonna be so
many gaps in everything that you do and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the next people that come along can
fill those gaps Or fill some of those gaps
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the end, it's always for the people
you can never have enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want more We don't want to fight
against something that always exists and
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a YouTube channel is not
competition Especially here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean my god I work every day at this and
I get 160 people watching, you know with a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of thousand views Jolie only has
like 1.5 million YouTube YouTube YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his own little thing and he does
bong reps and it's ridiculous and
[SPEAKER_00]: hilarious But that motherfucker gets
hundreds of thousands if not millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: hits Every time he posts a video so when I
see videos like that I don't think about
[SPEAKER_00]: Competition in regards to me and my
friends Remo was one of my huge
[SPEAKER_00]: inspirations Remo had his channel years
before I had mine and I watched his
[SPEAKER_00]: channel and I kind of got inspired by it
and I talked to him and I asked him what
[SPEAKER_00]: camera he had And these are the this is
how we inspire each other and because Remo
[SPEAKER_00]: is not a scared little boy He just shared
all of his information.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, yeah, I do this do that You can
you can get this camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's oh great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much Remo and because of it
I've done the same thing for anyone that's
[SPEAKER_00]: asked me Why not same with my macro
photographs anything that people want to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if I hadn't shared the
information some of the some of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are doing and doing great things
today They might not be doing it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: same level, you know And I feel the exact
same way because Remo and some other key
[SPEAKER_00]: people shared information with with me
including monkey who was from Overgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: days this guy this guy from the UK man He
gave me so much information on macro
[SPEAKER_00]: photography when Jason King the author of
the Canna Bible Would not tell me a single
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I asked him if he would show me some
tips about macro photography because I had
[SPEAKER_00]: an interest and he said yeah as Soon as
you show me how to manufacture bubble bags
[SPEAKER_00]: and sell them all around the world on the
internet That's exactly what he said to me
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I my channel I think started in
oh five, but I didn't really start posting
[SPEAKER_00]: till around 2012 Or so Well, that's
exactly it Amelia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really feel so much that it's
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I was a little bit shocked when Todd
was not coming to hash church anymore and
[SPEAKER_00]: had started his own show with many of the
panelists that have been on hash church
[SPEAKER_00]: before but That was just a scared little
boy in me and after the community sent me
[SPEAKER_00]: many many wonderful messages Saying hey,
you know just keep doing you it's all good
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is all good It's gonna be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: His show will be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna be against it and you know,
I think that My show hash church is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be about inclusivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about including people and not trying
to create only the cream of the cream Of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cream because I think everyone is the
cream of the crop in hash church I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: love my bros d4 20k and John Berfalo You
know, they they sit there they laugh they
[SPEAKER_00]: share what stories they can and what
information they can and I love them for
[SPEAKER_00]: it They may not be chemists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be doctors with PhDs,
but they certainly belong on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they're a part of it and That's
why that's why I want to be inclusive and
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly it injury, you know having
someone tell me that someone I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: come on if so-and-so was on your show Just
seems childish to me and it doesn't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: inclusive and so I'm gonna continue on the
way we're doing it be inclusive and invite
[SPEAKER_00]: as many people on as possible and Most
famous potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think I'm on that list
myself But there's some pretty famous
[SPEAKER_00]: potheads out there Like real famous people
obviously Bob Marley Maybe the most famous
[SPEAKER_00]: herb herb aficionado on the planet and
then you know many of his sons,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know right under that Snoop obviously
huge back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woody was pretty well known for it and
Yeah, he's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true, but he lives on you know,
he may be dead But he's the most alive
[SPEAKER_00]: dead person I've ever come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, holy shit Yeah, good to see Chase
welcome Willie Nelson solventless mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah solventless mind is the man I want to
get him on hash church.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who's gonna be getting on hash
church in the near future I also wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the jungle boys on hash church talk to
them a little bit and Maybe I'll get the
[SPEAKER_00]: guys from the real green dragon who are
some old-school Cali growers that They
[SPEAKER_00]: just really started Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check them out the real green
dragon and Yeah, we're actually working
[SPEAKER_00]: with them Here in the lab in the next
couple of days We're processing resin for
[SPEAKER_00]: the real green dragon and we just
processed some for LA Kush So a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies down there that the bubble man
brand and Blue River and whatnot will be
[SPEAKER_00]: available at and Yeah, nice to be
producing five-star plus Anthony you won't
[SPEAKER_00]: be disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a bloody case of it I got to
get back to these giveaways, but you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what the problem with the giveaways is I
stack all the things that need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: shipped and Sometimes people send me
emails that are a little confusing They
[SPEAKER_00]: don't say what episode and what they won
and so I have to kind of go back and it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes the sort of silly thing that It's
just a little bit difficult for me to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: track of so 11 o'clock man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soon half an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to go to the Sunshine Coast I'm not
sure if I'm gonna go live on the Sunshine
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast or not And if I do I'm not sure if I
would go through Instagram if you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: don't follow me on Instagram You should BC
bubble man because I might do my live From
[SPEAKER_00]: the ferry or from over there on Instagram

outlook even in the negative things in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact most importantly in the negative
things It was when I had a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: outlook that the negative that energy that
intense energy There's so much energy in

can transfer that energy into good and it
[SPEAKER_00]: is like a big crack You know out of the

from people not people that are well-known
[SPEAKER_00]: or famous or whatever or that can do my
personal agenda Well, but people I see
[SPEAKER_00]: every person as a person who can help you
and more importantly that you can help if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make someone's day better by
saying a couple words or giving them a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking $8 bottle of bong cleaner Why
wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't you and then the way I look
at it is it's contagious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets passed on, you know Someone smiled
at me the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a lovely smile and I and I
literally minutes later I found myself
[SPEAKER_00]: helping this guy deliver his pat his he
had these things on a roller Super heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of boxes and I just lifted it up
over the lip to let him get into the store
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was walking to I probably would
have done it anyway, but as I was doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt that woman who had smiled at me
just a nice smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's nice to be nice to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure It's a good idea to be living
in cities that are so close that we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: miserable and angry with one another and
complaining Constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Tony Vesor is a genius fucking great
guy We work really well together Tony and
[SPEAKER_00]: I like peanut butter and jam very
symbiotic and always always always doing
[SPEAKER_00]: great things You're gonna see a lot of
what we've been doing, you know Tony's
[SPEAKER_00]: been showing little bits and pieces of the
lab work and you know the new technologies
[SPEAKER_00]: with the terpenes and some of the new
products and You're gonna see a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: new things that are coming out and we're
gonna be talking about Jamaica in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future as well So there's lots of good
things happening I currently do not own
[SPEAKER_00]: shares in CNAB Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working out to make that happen in the
very near future Apparently they say I do
[SPEAKER_00]: but I haven't seen the documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really will be waiting for those
documents, but yeah I would definitely You
[SPEAKER_00]: know United Cannabis is doing great things
Prana is an amazing product and the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's in Harborside and Steve D'Angelo
loves it The fact that it was it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: basis of River Rock success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that We're very very very excited
at the prospects of being able to one day
[SPEAKER_00]: Produce the raw product medicine in
Jamaica so we can produce prana and ship
[SPEAKER_00]: it worldwide out of Jamaica sun-grown
tropical grown, you know lion bread
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars from Jamaica I've seen some
cultivars with valencine terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to go through my list There's if
you go on SC labs You can go through their
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene tests and most of like Tony Blue
River All the ones we had done are public
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can click on it and you can see
them They're also at BlueRiverExtracts.ca
[SPEAKER_00]: and BlueRiverExtracts.com under terpenes
And you can look at all of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene Laboratory tests and it'll show
you valencines towards the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look for one that has some present
It's always a very small amount but It's
[SPEAKER_00]: there it is there Yeah, yeah, man,
it's gonna be good it's gonna be good
[SPEAKER_00]: trust me we're very excited about it Yeah,
Hetty Riff, you know, it's not a bad idea
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm right down the street from both
harborsides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go check it out, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have bubble man brand they have Blue
River they have prana Well the super dupe
[SPEAKER_00]: that's oxidization it can be water present
that's doing that if you don't dry it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly if you dry it in a patty and the
water stays there that'll You know magnify
[SPEAKER_00]: the light that's getting into it It'll
oxidize it faster get the water out break
[SPEAKER_00]: it into powder use a desiccant to with
gravity to pull the moisture out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: resin as soon as possible and If you want
to preserve the color you can put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fridge and keep it cold and the color
will stay the same however Take a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit and go both ways and you'll see the
preserved is often a little more racy And
[SPEAKER_00]: the cured is often a little more spacey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on what you want for
your high Those are total generalizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I don't want you to think that
that's the way it's gonna be all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is kind of a generalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you cut the cultivar down a
little early It's a bit racy ie blonde
[SPEAKER_00]: Lebanese hash you cut it down a little
late.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more spacey ie red Lebanese
hash Same hashes just cut early cut late
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, they see a lot of product Frankie a
Lot of product to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really got to have your price point
and your quality has to be on point IG for
[SPEAKER_00]: what's that Fatta Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed that cannabis cup winner 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go Man, take Mexican bud and
concentrate and clean it so you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to Brick it and send it over I'm sure
they're doing it dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they're doing it concentrates are
vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Actually, that's great to hear savage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that that that came Oh,
look at this and it's Smith little little
[SPEAKER_00]: bumbot little bumbot needs to be blocked
out Five-star you pop those reefer man
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have not I've held on to them until
the greenhouse gets here Yes, I have
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked Hawaiian strains from the early 90s
I Crack up at the ban hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sometimes we've got a ban hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been here for a while I haven't been
paying attention Amelia, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm listening It's not easy to just gain
my attention with a nice set of boobs or
[SPEAKER_00]: ass I have been with my wife for 29 years
extremely committed and You know a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: set of boobs or a nice set of nice ass is
not going to be grabbing my attention
[SPEAKER_00]: anytime soon, but It may grab the ban
hammers attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Ban hammer Let's have one more puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it then I got to get out of here
because I really do have to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunshine Coast and I'll try to go live
I'll try to do something in the least
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll you'll be there for the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the video is always fun, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that Amelia you grab what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some lyrics or something there difficult
fuckhead Everyone thinks that Frankie
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone thinks that But when you get into
a level where many many people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: that same level and some who have even a
bit of a higher level it's you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand like those guys see a lot of
material or they just have their own
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse coming down with 5,000 kilos or
whatever and they they they don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like Who knows price quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be one of the two Quality
always sells Quality always sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one ever says no to quality Like that's
it's the thing about cognitive dissonance
[SPEAKER_00]: when we think what we have is,
you know I'm not saying this about Frankie
[SPEAKER_00]: because Frankie very well May have the
utter and complete kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that he doesn't but let's
just be honest Frankie is everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone believes they have the utter and
complete kill and Sometimes often most
[SPEAKER_00]: times they don't it's like it's like If
every restaurant thought they were the
[SPEAKER_00]: best and it's like actually you guys are
all three star and below and these four
[SPEAKER_00]: and five star restaurants are actually the
ones that are quite You know on every
[SPEAKER_00]: level From the environment to the dishes
to the food to the service to everything
[SPEAKER_00]: is just better And so it's a weird thing
every yeah, he's he's all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all done this We've all done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the 2,400 K pounds, you know and down
to like much lower people are selling for
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 18 some for 12 all these greenhouses
are coming down I feel you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you but understand tomatoes cost
about $10 to grow So the day of you
[SPEAKER_00]: getting $2,000 a pound are slowly coming
to an end We're gonna grow this shit
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculturally, bro We're gonna grow this
in fields acres and fucking hectares and
[SPEAKER_00]: sections large and then guys like
solventless mind and myself are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: extract them and then all of you guys are
going to Dab and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna happen any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm damn sure making sure of it And our
acres getting flowered soon And think of
[SPEAKER_00]: the acreage that I bet you it's not that
many acres that you would need to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: the world's resin think of how much
Oxycodone and fentanyl and all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: morphine Based drugs all of these opium
based drugs 90% of that opium is grown on
[SPEAKER_00]: a tiny little island off the coast of
Tasmania They grow tons and tons and tons
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, but it's for almost the whole
pharmaceutical world And so I think we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be surprised that we could get it done in
a pretty decent amount of land to grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: world's resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Let's not get political No,
no, let's not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like saying let's all argue about
vaccinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's all talk about our religious beliefs
Fuck that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna do any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going solventless mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just talking earlier how badly I
want to get you a on a wake and bake or Be
[SPEAKER_00]: even more importantly on a hash church and
just talk about resin and talk about hash
[SPEAKER_00]: making and talk about fucking All sorts of
real shit be good to have you dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why we can't seem to make it
happen But let's try to make it happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the near future And now that I've said it
on a chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's gonna keep making sure they ask
me each time Hey, what's going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he gonna be coming in?

slice of chocolate cake sounds like some I
