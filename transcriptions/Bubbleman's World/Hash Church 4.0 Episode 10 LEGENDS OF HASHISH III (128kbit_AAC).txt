Got
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we are live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Legends of Hash 3, Hash Church
4.0, episode eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been ages since I've done a Hash
Church episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got some folks coming in right now,
figuring out their logistics with their
[SPEAKER_02]: audio and their video and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, super stoked to be here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super stoked to talk to all the winners
from Legends of Hash number three in Los
[SPEAKER_02]: Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, I think if you got to go to
Legends of Hash, you actually were a
[SPEAKER_02]: winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was another level of winning,
which were the people who really shined,
[SPEAKER_02]: who brought the hashes that really,
you know, moved people, whether it was
[SPEAKER_02]: through their olfactory, through that
numbness of the brain and body,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the beautiful flavors that showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had people come from all over America
and absolutely represent Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking represented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you, we'll be talking about
that here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just super excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, unfortunately, right now,
Addison is not feeling very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might not actually make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were close to canceling for a second
time in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just I wasn't having it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to continue on the way we
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to just welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, we only have a few folks into the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, holy shit, Legends of Hash
represented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Presenting winners.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dudes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys fucking crushed it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to introduce yourself and
tell us a little bit about about your
[SPEAKER_02]: journey that that brought you to Legends
of Hash three in Los Angeles to to crush
[SPEAKER_02]: mode so hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, well, I'm Chris.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Dan.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Papa burger.
[SPEAKER_08]: Papa burger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start off with something proper this
morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, man, I wish I had some of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're from Oklahoma and we are skunk
and we're a legal hash maker here in the
[SPEAKER_08]: state.
[SPEAKER_08]: All licensed and been doing this for since
twenty nineteen since it started.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I mean, I guess I'm just I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just been a crazy journey,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I learned a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did did you say twenty nineteen is when
you started?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when we started in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, as far as that's pretty much when it
was right after it went legal,
[SPEAKER_08]: like the beginning of twenty nineteen.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the time we were living in Colorado and
we we've lived here before and we have
[SPEAKER_08]: family here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as soon as they legally legalized,
we wanted to be in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we made the jump and started skunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Started making hash in twenty twenty
eighteen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Twenty eighteen.
[SPEAKER_08]: The end of twenty eighteen is when we
started making hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what turned you guys on to making hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what you guys were just like,
we should just start making hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I mean, originally it was a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: We learned how to make bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it was like we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing the beat.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were dabbling the BHO for a while,
but the BHO I just it's it was like a hard
[SPEAKER_08]: thing to be able to get into like the
legal market.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that's when we found Roslyn
watched a lot of your episodes on actually
[SPEAKER_08]: how to make, you know, the bubble hash and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just been it's been crazy ever
since.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, we used to pretty much
strictly just grow for like flour.
[SPEAKER_08]: But everything like we pretty much have
only switched over to Roslyn lately,
[SPEAKER_08]: like all of our flour, everything that we
do just strictly goes to Roslyn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, listen, it's absolutely top
notch Terps, top notch Roslyn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's it's absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you guys took first and second in
Roslyn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also got a People's Choice
Award, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was was a derby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys got the little derby cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't have it yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: But soon it might be at the PO box.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't had a chance to check.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if not there, they're very soon and we
can't wait, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're really excited for that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's great to see, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've I just it brought a smile to my face
to see that you guys came so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, California, really,
whether people want to admit it or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's it's kind of like the center of
the cannabis universe, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be honest with yourself and
you want to see like and you go back
[SPEAKER_02]: historically, like obviously I'm talking
about our sort of history, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: going back to like the 1960s, the 1970s
and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, cannabis and hashish has a much
deeper history.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even today, I'm wearing my classic
shirt of these Lebanese women doing dry
[SPEAKER_02]: sifting over a table.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is probably a lot longer ago than
1970.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hashish has a deep and rich history in
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back hundreds of years,
if not a thousand plus years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for our history, you know,
for the California part of things,
[SPEAKER_02]: really, since like the late 60s,
early 70s, they seem to be the first ones
[SPEAKER_02]: to pull the mails.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem to be the first ones to cut the
flowering period down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem to be the first ones to get into
oil making and hash making.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just they were the first ones to
really take this so absolutely serious and
[SPEAKER_02]: have this infectious love of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think a lot of that spread out from
Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's spread right up the coast to
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not too different up here in regards
to our love of cannabis and our passion of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'm sure to all those packs
over the years that got sent out of Cali
[SPEAKER_02]: across the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the inspiration, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're literally inhaling California
into your lungs and we get affected by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so shout out to California.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys want to hear something
absolutely fucking bat shit crazy,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never been to California.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never I've never been to California,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried a bunch of times in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a bunch of Grateful Dead tickets
on mail order and, you know, tried to go
[SPEAKER_02]: across the border and they would just deny
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up giving these Grateful Dead
tickets away in the in the forest in
[SPEAKER_02]: British Columbia because I just couldn't
get over the border.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happened time and time again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when Jerry died, I was pretty
upset about it because I wanted to see him
[SPEAKER_02]: play in California, of course,
you know, Mountain View or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Colin?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, just talking to the Oklahoma boys
here, crush mode at the fucking Legends of
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you guys got to spend time
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of missed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I was floating around a little bit,
but I was just head down trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through all the entries to be real,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I tried to float around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, to be real, it was like
first night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I got to focus on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then someone told me, like,
you got to get in at 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yo, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at Hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at Hash Church today, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like four of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are like, what time is it at?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, dude, I sent three emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 9 a.m., bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you smoking over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but no, it was dope because I I ended
up leaving the event around like 10 on the
[SPEAKER_00]: first night and then just going back to my
spot and just like focused on everything
[SPEAKER_00]: and just like went through it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, everyone was like,
you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you going through everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, to be honest, like I have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just smell because things that
smell great don't necessarily taste great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things that taste great don't
necessarily smell great, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to give every
single person that that same moment that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would if it's your own work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good to go through it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of work, but it was
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good to be in a focus setting for
just myself because even having like just
[SPEAKER_00]: the open air and then everyone else around
me, it was tough to like really get into
[SPEAKER_00]: jars and really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was nice to be able to have both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely went back to jars that I
tried outside or at the event and then was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, maybe I'll give us a
different score.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a unique thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, before Legends happened,
there was no events like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many now I can't even count
them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, when we first started Legends
over 20 years ago, you know, the idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting 20 to 30 high end flavors in like
a two to four hour period was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: unheard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't exist, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you, like people that I know
that are as hard of smokers as you could
[SPEAKER_02]: be were like finding their levels of
limitations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everyone but Skunkman Sam,
because that guy has no limitations
[SPEAKER_02]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just a savage maniac.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the rest of us, you know,
I'd be I find myself pailing out like out
[SPEAKER_02]: in front of the restaurant, just getting
some air with some other heavies out out
[SPEAKER_02]: in front of the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, and kind of like looking
like, really, like, are we pushing
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves that hard?
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep in mind, Skunkman Sam was dumping
like two grams at a time into an Afghan
[SPEAKER_02]: hubbly bubbly that we were lighting with
flames coming off of this thing like a
[SPEAKER_02]: foot and a half each time you lit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you were getting extremely,
extremely, extremely high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a good question from Stinky Farms in
the room for the for the Oakey group there
[SPEAKER_02]: that he wanted to know what medium is your
flower grown in?
[SPEAKER_08]: So we use a cocoa, a highly amended cocoa
that's kind of we kind of try to like
[SPEAKER_08]: build a living soil almost out of a cocoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then throughout the lifecycle,
the plant, we continue to add natural and
[SPEAKER_08]: organic inputs as well as microbes to try
to keep since cocoa doesn't really hold on
[SPEAKER_08]: to very much of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we like to but we want to create that
rises fear and then continue to add to
[SPEAKER_08]: that throughout the lifecycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I like where you're coming from
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That micro rises fear has an intelligence
that humans have not yet acquired.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fucking thing knows exactly what the
plant needs, when the plant needs it,
[SPEAKER_02]: where the plant needs it, how the plant
needs it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some incredible folks out there
that do some incredible work in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: their, you know, feeding of the plant and
getting the plant up to that level of
[SPEAKER_02]: expression where it can be like a winner
of Legends of Hash Papa Burger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's something special for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying I haven't seen beautiful
resin grown in salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I've seen the nicest resins I've
ever seen have been grown in living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love the idea of building that bridge
and being like, well, maybe we can't do
[SPEAKER_02]: the fully fully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, listen, real fully living soils
generally isn't going to be in pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be like out in a on a field
like where it's actually connected to
[SPEAKER_02]: nature and living.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the more we can bring that in to the
scenario and, you know, adding those
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes and creating that somewhat living
soil, maybe we could call it somewhat
[SPEAKER_02]: living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly shows in your results because
these flavors are they're just man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's almost like almost like some some
poo poo kaka in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some like, there's some goodness
in here, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little baby turds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think I'm going to I think I'm going
to wake and bake with some Papa Burger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I haven't touched it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an untouched man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you did that.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean, just not just being able to
not smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's because I'm a macro
photographer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I really wanted to do was I
wanted to I wanted to do some nice photos
[SPEAKER_02]: for the few that I managed to stoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've just been crushing them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today I figured is a great spot to to
do some crush mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also want to say hi to Logan,
who's in the room torching up his banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to say hi back right away,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Logan is awesome young guy who's just
taking it upon himself to take static
[SPEAKER_02]: sifting to the next level, working along
with myself with sample filtration and the
[SPEAKER_02]: the static sifting machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Logan has some of the most profound static
sifting photos of, you know, shit on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: like beautiful resin on his glove and so
thank you for keeping sifting alive,
[SPEAKER_02]: Logan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure Skunkman Sam thanks you as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did invite Skunkman Sam today,
but it was very last minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see if he's managing to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is about six quarter after six p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: where he lives in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully we'll see him later as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see cache is there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure who that is exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his camera off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But welcome to you as well, fine brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going good, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are you calling from?
[SPEAKER_06]: I am up in the northwest right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my stomping grounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you just down across the border from
me or?
[SPEAKER_06]: I sure am.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're right up here, like in the Seven
Lakes area of Washington.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're like probably an hour away from
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, back in the day, and I don't
know how many of you know this,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I first moved here in like ninety
six, I ended up going a couple of years
[SPEAKER_02]: later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hitchhiking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't hitchhiking, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the last time I've been to
America, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nineteen ninety eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rented a brand new car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut my fucking hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm just going to I'm going to
look.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to I'm going to get across the
border.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had denied me at the border so many
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time I bought every single ticket to
fish tour summer tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought miracle tickets to give away and
I got denied at the border.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was thirty seven concert tickets,
just mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy also had thirty seven that all
went to shit because we bought them on my
[SPEAKER_02]: credit card and I couldn't even give them
away at the box office to people because
[SPEAKER_02]: they needed my credit card to pick them
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was my last attempt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm going to go see Fish at the
Gorge and I drive across the border.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make it mainly because Fish had just
played in Vancouver and I was in a fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: circus of freaks who were crossing the
border.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I probably looked the least freaky at
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up picking up a couple
hitchhikers and it was Marble Slinger and
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason Lee, the glass blowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these guys ended up living in
Bellingham, which is really close to
[SPEAKER_02]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for many, many years, I had this
incredible connection to all these amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: glass blowers that were right in
Bellingham.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would come up over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I saw Slinger the other
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys know Marble
Slinger, the glass blower, but he was
[SPEAKER_02]: writing on the High Times page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to bubble man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me my first oil dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me my first full mouth bubble hash
dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turned me on to the melts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just neat to see that history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was all because I picked him up
as a young Scraggle hitchhiker on his way
[SPEAKER_02]: to Fish Tour, which was very close to
probably where you're at there,
[SPEAKER_02]: Cache.
[SPEAKER_02]: What company did you represent with at
Legends?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cache, you're muted.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we knew this was going to
happen, the mute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You called it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our entry was with Papaya Guava.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a little bit of a mix up on
the brand name that it appeared.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think, like on the media that Legend
of Hashish posted, I think it said
[SPEAKER_06]: Dengsar, which is one of our teams.
[SPEAKER_06]: But down in SoCal, our team is Cache.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's kind of what the entry was
supposed to be under.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do fuck up every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoke an enormous amount of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Addison is just also a savage maniac.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a puffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy fucking smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not making it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not faking.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is legitimately who he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll do better next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we can say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was complicated, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shout out to JP Toro for the banger
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: About to light up a little Papa burger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got my banger basket full and clean with
some brand new ISO in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's always nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets pretty yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets pretty yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this new piece here on the rig,
and it's just perfect for a sipper like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys know what they're doing over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did invite Scott and JP and Darby as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good with this group.
[SPEAKER_02]: If no one else shows up, we'll have a nice
couple hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll puff some bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll listen to some stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see where everyone's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely just loving the... Well,
I'm loving the excitement that Legends
[SPEAKER_02]: came off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we had less than a week of Legends
being over before Lorenzo from Terps Army.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Lorenzo from Terps Army.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit us up and was like, why don't we do a
Legends in Barcelona this year for Spanish
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were like, yeah, why don't we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, fuck, I haven't done a Legends of
Hash in Barcelona since 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like we're going to be doing
a Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be obviously as intense as the
one that Addison did.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I got to give this guy an
absolute massive shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without Addison, there would be no Legends
of Hash in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had really only ever been in Vancouver,
Amsterdam, Jamaica, Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go to America, so why would it be
in America, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Addison hit me up a couple of years ago
and was like, listen, I want to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: Legends of Hash to America.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's real value here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the job that he did, him and Meredith
and the whole team building out all those
[SPEAKER_02]: Moroccan style booths and just,
you know, we lost our venue 90 days before
[SPEAKER_02]: the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the guy was just like, oh,
hey, you know how you put a $10,000
[SPEAKER_02]: deposit down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, man, like my landlord's evicting
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were like, what do you... We're
like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we ended up like he had to find that
whole new venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did so much that I'll never be able to
say enough positive things about Addison
[SPEAKER_02]: and the team down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a huge shout out to him for
everything that he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looked and sounded like it was an
absolutely amazing time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine the FOMO I had sitting up here in
Canada, not able to go to Legends of Hash
[SPEAKER_02]: now for the third time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have applied for a Nexus card,
so I sent Homeland Security all my
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exposed myself completely, which is fine,
because I don't break the law or do any
[SPEAKER_02]: shady shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm hoping that I get this Nexus
card by next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will absolutely be in Barcelona,
but I would also love to be in Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_02]: next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, really probably the year after,
because I think we're doing it instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: December around January.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see where that all falls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Logan?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to tell us a little bit about
Logan's journey and how you ended up now
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Legends of Hash for... Is this your
third year or second year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Second year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wolverine Dabbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You crushed it last year too, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was the only competitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what better way to... But here,
here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can laugh about that, but think about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're really saying was,
I was the only person with full melt dry
[SPEAKER_02]: sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something different,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say I was the only competitor,
it kind of takes away from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I speak in a room full of heads,
I always ask people, who here has flour?
[SPEAKER_02]: And almost every hand goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll ask, who here has full melt
bubble?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few hands will go up, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people will have rosin, which is
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you ask the room, who here has full
melt dry sift, it is fucking crickets and
[SPEAKER_02]: tumbleweeds, which you guys probably know
about up in Oklahoma there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a real thing to just have dry sift
that can melt into a liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to have it is something to be said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I personally thank you for showing up
and being the only person that showed up
[SPEAKER_02]: with it, because otherwise no one would
have had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's never a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us a little bit about your journey
into the static realm and into producing
[SPEAKER_02]: the fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so essentially I started making
extracts when I was 17, so around 2013,
[SPEAKER_04]: 2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started with hydrocarbon and then
distillates.
[SPEAKER_04]: I moved on to doing isolates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reformulating, reconstructing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually not until 2021 that I
started doing static.
[SPEAKER_04]: My buddy Dylan had left me his screens
when he moved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he went to go work for Mock
Technologies and left me the screens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he always told me, dry sift is like
the cream of the crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can get it, it's the best
experience, the best high, essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started looking into videos on
YouTube and I stumbled across your videos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stumbled across several other videos.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the very first day I pulled the screens
out, I cleaned them completely,
[SPEAKER_04]: set up a table.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had YouTube going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had my screens right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had my material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I stood there for 14 hours rubbing a
screen and listening to other people talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about rubbing a screen and just listening
to the actual screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being rubbed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sound will always kind of stick in
my brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been around it for thousands of hours
now, but it's absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I started doing dry sift and I
got it to the purity that I was able to
[SPEAKER_04]: achieve, which I consider to be around 98,
99% purity in trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I started consuming that,
I fell in love and I couldn't go back to
[SPEAKER_04]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely perfect in every way,
in my opinion, simply because the terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: content is right where you want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sitting around four to 6%,
which is perfect for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terpenes themselves are hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anything above 6% can be harmful for
inhalation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you come up with that number?
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: The five to 6%, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just that you're safe at four or
five, but anything over, because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in this, I've always like,
listen, I've been smoking eight to 10%
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene for, I would say a good solid 10
years, maybe more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't felt anything,
but I do believe, and especially after
[SPEAKER_02]: doing Blue River extracts with Tony for
all those years, that we absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: reached the level that was too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never smoked that level for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt that level personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess it's just a subjective
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt that was above 10, you know,
around the 11 to 12, it just stopped being
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyable for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like five, six, seven, eight,
like even, you know, I think the hash we
[SPEAKER_02]: made recently, no, that's pietella.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this was some rosin we made recently
at my facility in Canada here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it came back 9.8% terpene,
75.7% THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wonder where you got that number,
because you seem like a very intelligent
[SPEAKER_02]: guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty much just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, when you look at it,
terpenes are a hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've said it a million times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to make solventless hash when
it's loaded up with hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just, I find that my throat
personally reacts at anything above 6%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I start coughing and it's,
my throat tightens up.
[SPEAKER_04]: My chest tightens up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, for me, it's the 6% mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like consuming things above the 6%
mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using fresh frozen and getting
above 6% versus if you're using dried and
[SPEAKER_02]: cured and getting above 6%, reducing the
percentage of mono terpenes that are
[SPEAKER_02]: present in the hash, which really for
decades, we always dry the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We dried those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cured those out of flour because they
were harsh.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I'll tell you, life is so fucking
trippy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a trip, Colin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my buddy sends, he's like, I want to
send you some pietella.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he sends me this beautiful little piece
of pietella.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, do you know what this looks like to
me, Colin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like bubble hash that didn't get
dried properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was like back in the original days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd get shamed for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's the hottest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are so fucked as human beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it only happens when you get
older, where you start seeing these like
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 year cycles where you're like,
so like the thing that everyone shamed
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone for and mocked everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never forget someone putting a piece
of hash down like this at Legends one
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't able to dry it on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely nothing against him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he put it in front of Rob and Dave and
they literally just like grabbed it and
[SPEAKER_02]: like was like that one's wet and like
didn't even try it, just threw it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do understand it because,
and not to say pietella smokes like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: wet, it just looks like it's wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I would say that is because
probably the same thing that's happening
[SPEAKER_02]: with hash that you leave water in,
which is that water sort of makes its way
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the hash eventually by foaming the
hash up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pietella, because you're sealing it in a
turkey bag, the terpene are doing the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're under pressure and they're
traveling outward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as they travel outward, they foam up
the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what pietella is guaranteed
100% for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it totally looks like buttered wet
hash from the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it did make me chuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's funny because I said the same
thing to myself, but then I moved on fast
[SPEAKER_00]: from that thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing I want to go back to
what you brought up about the dry cure
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the fresh frozen versus chemically
what's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good call out because it's
also why some people like certain types of
[SPEAKER_00]: herb over others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot to do with the chemical
profile and the chemotype that has become
[SPEAKER_00]: over the life cycle of its time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The choices that that particular grower,
that processor made, that's the relatable
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of the actual medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think about that, I think you're
calling out a really important aspect that
[SPEAKER_00]: I think has yet to really come into focus
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these are things I know you and I
and people like as well as Tony and other.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us have had these conversations
together that, hey, yeah, these are
[SPEAKER_00]: different products because by design,
chemically, they're just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why I think I've worked with a
toxicologist for the past three years of
[SPEAKER_00]: my time doing what I've been doing with
formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just be really candid with everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much about how these cost
of chemicals harm our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's literally cells dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that point of view, I think,
Mark, you're touching on something real
[SPEAKER_00]: like the upper echelon from fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's chemicals there that are actually
protecting our bodies versus harming them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also not really a clear
understanding of what those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's important to call that
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly feel like we're all still in
kindergarten.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, man, imagine Sam, he's been
doing this for like 40 to 50 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he also probably feels like he's in
kindergarten.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an endless array of like,
and then we discover something like rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: How crazy is rosin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even bubble hash, like water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how crazy are those two things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Without those two things, the face of
cannabis extracts would look so different
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They blow my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was happy to be around for both of them,
to be like right on the ground floor for
[SPEAKER_02]: both of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't the first person to do it by any
means, but I'll tell you, it wasn't far
[SPEAKER_02]: after soil grown press that button.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a guy named Bud on Instagram
that he was on Hash Church episode 25
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, well, you know,
we were making flags with our foam out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like in the parchment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'd zip it with your titanium
dabber and then pull a flag and it would
[SPEAKER_02]: be a long flag of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, we were making flags and I
ran out of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, and I don't know why,
but I was just like, I just put a bud in
[SPEAKER_02]: the parchment and I hit that with the hair
straightener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of like doing this to hash,
to melt it, he just randomly, like for no
[SPEAKER_02]: reason, did it to a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he's like, when I opened it up,
he was like, there was oil all around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, I think he was with his
dad or something, but they were both
[SPEAKER_02]: tripping out at the whole concept of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, my goodness, thank goodness
that it came to be because personally,
[SPEAKER_02]: I quite love rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do enjoy it, but what I like
about it the most is that kids of this
[SPEAKER_02]: generation now, when I say kids,
like, you know, 18 to 25 year old guys
[SPEAKER_02]: that are like just experimenting for the
first time, they're no longer blasting
[SPEAKER_02]: cans of butane, like in a very,
very dangerous environment that literally
[SPEAKER_02]: could change their lives forever,
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have no idea until you have kids
what that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just don't want my kids to tattoo
their face or burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two things I am like,
do whatever else you want, but just like
[SPEAKER_02]: keep your face your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, you know, I grew up with a father
who was a fireman.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took burning super serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe how many people were
willing to risk their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd see people posting on Instagram,
like a girl in a bikini top on a balcony
[SPEAKER_02]: blasting a can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the background, you can see
something plugged into the wall outlet
[SPEAKER_02]: outside on the deck with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, oh my God, like that
shit inside the wall is just sparking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you could shrink down and go in
the wall, you'd see that they spark
[SPEAKER_02]: continually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and butane is heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sinks and it pools right at the
level of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's one thing to make a mistake
and hurt yourself, but when you burn
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself and now you're burnt for life,
that's a real bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love rosin for that reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason alone, the fact that dudes can
just go grab a hair straightener and like
[SPEAKER_02]: have a dab in the afternoon from a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big supporter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't miss the open blast days.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should just be in a lab with someone
who's really good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they understand all the SOPs and they
have the C1 D1 room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like they have degrees in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those are good guys to like,
yeah, yeah, you guys do that over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about myself that I learned,
especially after accidentally sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: stumbling across water hash and then
really focusing and popularizing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What really blew me away was just the
absolute and complete different level of
[SPEAKER_02]: high that you experienced compared to
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I had taken flower right to the
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just on the ceiling, just smoking so
much flower that I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was coughing shit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, I haven't coughed anything up
in like 28 years and I smoke a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't cough stuff up when you just
smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for me, it's like having the
flavors around me are more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do appreciate the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I definitely get into like when
I'm Fino hunting, I definitely try a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the different Finos just so I
understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love the flower, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't smoked flower in 28 years,
but 20, 24 years, 24 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I love flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just look at it as like, it's my little
resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the pizza box, you know,
it's brought me my pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, pizza box, but I don't eat the pizza
box.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually open it up and take the pizza
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wash the resin or bounce the resin
or press the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, funny enough, my most watched
video on my YouTube channel is this me
[SPEAKER_02]: pressing a bunch of where is my bike
flower in a long peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like giving me like 30% return
this flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I pressed like a half pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just funny that flower rosin is my
most viewed video.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the world right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you figure it out eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just figure it out eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Props to the almost 5 million people who
have watched that video.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, uh, that trips my mind out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the internet is such a trip that
you can be like, I'm just going to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: video and touch 5 million people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what were some of your, uh,
you know, your, your likes and dislikes of
[SPEAKER_02]: legends?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to make legends better every
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always like to hear some criticisms,
but, uh, I like to hear the likes first so
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can feel a little bit good about it
before we get taken down a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: notches.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go first, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we don't, we haven't, I've never been
to an event like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we, they don't really, we don't really
do stuff like that out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more like, I don't know, the vendor
style pop-ups.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, I don't know, man,
it's just, it was all about the culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the way everything was set up the,
um, yeah, man, it was just the best event
[SPEAKER_08]: that we've ever been to personally.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way the judging was set up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked that too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that everybody just got to kind
of judge everybody else's stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You couldn't necessarily like buy judge
kits or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just community.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go up to the hash bar and grab some
flavors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: The food was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the people could experience also
the, you know, the judge kits,
[SPEAKER_08]: but through the hash bar, you know,
and not, and so they could experience what
[SPEAKER_08]: we were experiencing at the same time.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not, yeah, that's nothing I've
experienced before.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You usually can't try, you know,
the entries that are sitting there or
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the beauty of California,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, uh, it was definitely a gauntlet
though, trying to get through all that
[SPEAKER_08]: hash, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely, uh, it puts you,
it shows you where your boundaries are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an interesting, um, you know,
listen, this happened by accident when we
[SPEAKER_02]: started legends of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had nothing to do with the competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, Sam sort of was like,
wanted to turn it into a competition
[SPEAKER_02]: because for me, what I said was I would
sell tickets to people who showed me a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful piece of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew that they were on a level of
appreciation of hash that they actually
[SPEAKER_02]: had one in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't take any, I didn't even smoke
any, I just look at it, feel it,
[SPEAKER_02]: smell it and be like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to come to legends of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to buy a ticket to legends of
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause another thing about legends was we
never, it wasn't about ever comping
[SPEAKER_02]: tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone paid to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, uh, the original one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was very, very different in the
sense that you couldn't promote your
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't promote yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you weren't allowed to have a cell
phone present at the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no cameras allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there was really no talking about it
on social media or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause most of that shit didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, it was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was, uh, a lot of old school
hash smugglers went to the original ones
[SPEAKER_02]: and they just, uh, they were serious dudes
and they couldn't be, they, they could not
[SPEAKER_02]: be a photo taken of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we made it very strict that you
couldn't bring cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, if you had a cell phone,
even out in your hand, you, you would be
[SPEAKER_02]: removed from the premises.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a fairly strict, uh,
cell phone dash camera rule at legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and no, no promotions whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then at that point, Sam was like,
wow, like everyone in this room,
[SPEAKER_02]: all 50 people have nice hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, we should do like a little
contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, you know,
like back then you have to understand too,
[SPEAKER_02]: like skunk man, Sam was like the snuffle
up against like people only really knew
[SPEAKER_02]: about him through stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't know that he was a real person
or until, you know, this was way before
[SPEAKER_02]: hash church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously that exposed a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, he was low key and people just
didn't know who he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was also after, you know,
a lot of them were after, um, 2008,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was when I posted the photo of his
dry sift for the first time, which,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't know if you guys ever saw that
picture, but it was, uh, it was a game
[SPEAKER_02]: changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I labeled it 99.9 9 9 9 9% pure heads,
skunk man, Sam secret tech or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, it's just like pure heads
just looks like caviar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, actually, yeah, there's one
behind me, but you kind of can't see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just pure heads, pure, beautiful
heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, everyone had wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first smoked his hash, it was the
strongest experience I had ever
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit rocked me so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brought all these stories to life that
Rob had been telling me in previous years
[SPEAKER_02]: about how high he would leave skunk man
Sam's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be like, well, how high could you
really be man?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just didn't know, but fuck I,
I figured it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point I left there so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm quite certain I was walking like a
one-legged man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was, it was over the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been that high actually in,
in probably 20 years, more than 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those are highs that just come
around maybe a couple of times in a
[SPEAKER_02]: lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you're in grade eight and you
first hit some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then apparently when you're.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how legends was for me that night,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been that high in so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: In so long or ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was definitely like the first day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe never.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we were, that's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a potential candidate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the most on smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of good dabs though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like really good dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a part of the culture that
I'd like to see grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see more people have access.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, you know, and the one thing
about legends, it is very much
[SPEAKER_02]: professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'd also love to see legends become
is to be able to bring other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: To witness the culture without feeling
alienated and being able to take like
[SPEAKER_02]: micro dabs, you know, get served like
microscopic dabs without any shaming and
[SPEAKER_02]: weird ego.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take bigger dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this fucking guy's dad,
you know, like that whole vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it would be nice to bring in other
people to witness this part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and just, you know, be a part of
it, but without being like, like
[SPEAKER_02]: frighteningly high, you know, like you
have to really, it would be a fraction of
[SPEAKER_02]: a pinhead, just a little bit of the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're not even going to blow
anything out, but they're going to feel a
[SPEAKER_02]: little flavor and they obviously have to
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually can give a micro dab and make it
feel like you've taken one puff on the
[SPEAKER_02]: joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a very small amount of
resin, but if they want to feel like they
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked the whole joint, well, that's a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to feel like you smoked
five joints, well, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got to learn how to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an important part of dabbing
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think that D-nails new unit is
absolutely going to help change the way we
[SPEAKER_02]: look at dabbing because the torch is very
sketchy and it's not indoor friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and it's probably never going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: D-nails are better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the coils and stuff and that new
induction disorderly, uh, um, conducts new
[SPEAKER_02]: little coil banger heater, but the D,
but the D-nail one that have you guys seen
[SPEAKER_02]: that thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The D-nail looks like even the next step
above that TSV so loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ordered the XL.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I saw it, as soon as I saw it,
I had to get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just like, ah, this will make
everything I've got a pre-order list.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys, if anyone isn't on one,
I can put you on my pre-order list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm going to be, I'm going to be
selling them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working with him for years and
he just does such great work.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really takes this shit seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I mean, I love my Terps Veed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had, I didn't like the sound of it
on all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's annoying and it's a very white noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought, you know, when I was just
talking to Brian one day from D-nail,
[SPEAKER_02]: about it and I guess he had been working
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea, but I was like,
dude, if you could just create a Terps
[SPEAKER_02]: Veed style, you know, vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd already been working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as if I'm giving this guy advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I swear to God, he showed me this
like three days later after I mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was like, how could you,
how did you create that in three days?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, dude, I've been working on it
for months.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just happened to say something three
days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indux did a good job on theirs too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So listen, that, that, that's next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like, you could do, um,
real dab bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a tool like this brings dab bars into
the equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're less likely to burn yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even those outer coils with the cable are
sketch as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this thing could hit the ground and
not be burning anyone or hurting anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the future of dab bars,
um, where it's no sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sleek.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got people raising and lowering
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some will probably put these little things
on a, on a little air press compressor
[SPEAKER_02]: with a little pedal on the floor so you
can make them go up and down with your
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm, I'm a dreamer man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a dreamer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see vapor bars are coming and vapor bars
are not going to have joints smoked in
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to have anything burned
in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be like gummies drinks
and vaporization of flowers and extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least here in Canada, I don't know
what's going to happen in the,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the U S but definitely the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the same way in New York,
like as we turn our stuff on there,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you, it'll really open up the
door for cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the cigar culture is like dying,
cannabis people come in and buy those
[SPEAKER_02]: grandfathered cigar shops where you could
invite people to smoke joints indoors and
[SPEAKER_02]: hang out with one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that would also be very popular
fucking private, like cannabis aficionados
[SPEAKER_02]: group where you just go and burn gaggers
on leather furniture with the boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what the license is hard to
get because in most places now you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke indoors, even with the big HEPA
system or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the grandfathered ones in most
cities are the cigar shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's still clubs where people
go and literally smoke cigars just in the
[SPEAKER_02]: open air around each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine how unenjoyable that is
personally being in like a room with like
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 dudes all just chuffing away hard on
cigars, but I could, I could hang out in
[SPEAKER_02]: the room getting joint smoked for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: That arses my throat out too though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there a lot of joints smoked at
legends?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, I had a big shout out to Jay,
happy monkey crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Jay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, uh, he was, he was one of the few
chief and down, you know, he was good
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, enjoyed himself repping,
repping the joint smokers, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: there was a couple, a couple of hash
holes.
[SPEAKER_08]: The inventing room guy gave us a couple of
hash holes to try those were delicious.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ron, our buddy Ron had some hash holes
with him from Sensei Mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Ron, that's how we got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Turfoba, I guess Ron was the one that
told him about us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Oh, I'm glad he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of good hash out here in
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, you know, I know we got our
problems.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of, overproduction of low
quality stuff out here, but there's also a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of good hash out here just because of
the level of competition and how easy it
[SPEAKER_08]: was to get into it in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it's just pushed us all to,
I mean, makes it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're really proud of what Oklahoma is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're glad that we got to share that
with people.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you guys for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Us too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about good hash man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is absolutely it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, it's just a nice thing to see
the culture of hash continuing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Legends tries to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tries to pay homage to the,
to the roots, to the old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I really, you know, I had someone
recently who's in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually in New York too,
Colin.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's partnered up with some pretty
well-known people in the industry and he's
[SPEAKER_02]: doing like an, uh, like a traditional
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, there's people that just still
love traditional hash, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old school gold seal, whatever you
want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so he's, he's talking about this
hash and how he wants to kind of get it
[SPEAKER_02]: out to the world and promote it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, I was sorry to not see
more of that at Legends because he was at
[SPEAKER_02]: Legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, listen, man,
like Legends isn't like what we make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what you make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want more, uh, traditional hash,
of course we'd love, cause what he said
[SPEAKER_02]: was, he said it was an amazing event,
but he said, I felt like it was just one
[SPEAKER_02]: section that we were visiting of the
event, you know, the dabbers that everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: was dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, he was like, it was a bit cracky.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of blow torches.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just from a different culture,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not, he's not torching is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you don't blow torch your bangers,
like it is to see a whole like 150 people
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's hardcore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was like, I'd like to see a
traditional hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well then get your friends from
different traditional hash companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: To bring in traditional hash and show us
so that we can, of course, we'd love to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a traditional hash section where you
could come and see the hash of old and
[SPEAKER_02]: learn about how it was made and meet
people from those cultures that are
[SPEAKER_02]: continuing those, um, you know,
those lineages on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the idea of Legends always paying
homage to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Legends is also the curation of the,
of the present of what is at the upper
[SPEAKER_02]: echelons of hash and oils and all the
equipment that goes behind it from the
[SPEAKER_02]: bangers to the dab rights, to the Cardas
and the puffco's, which is also,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to give both those companies a
shout out, Carter and puffco, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: focus V for really normalizing dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, their commercials are almost so
generic in the sense of the way you just
[SPEAKER_02]: see like the straightest looking people,
you know, they're painting this different
[SPEAKER_02]: narrative, which will like, for me,
I want that bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love our culture and that's not going
anywhere, but I also love the idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: building a bridge so people can come and
experience our culture and see what it is
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's a pretty cool culture,
especially if you love, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking hash and getting high,
you don't have to get annihilated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to go to Legends and smoke,
you know, 27 grams, but it's fucking fun
[SPEAKER_02]: if you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second day I ran into a guy who I know
is trying to do a traditional hash brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said the exact same thing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, what's up with like everyone
just using blowtorches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't see any like traditional hash
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think that's to your
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in which we make it because
you're, you're just offering us a platform
[SPEAKER_00]: to submit things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if predominantly everyone starts
submitting a traditional hash maybe that
[SPEAKER_00]: merits their traditional hash category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're, we're looking at,
maybe we're all trying to group things
[SPEAKER_00]: together in ways that perhaps it's not,
not the right way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just asking the question, you know,
cause the things have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly evolved so much, you know,
like think about, you know, we were just
[SPEAKER_00]: talking, touching on the whole fact that
like, if someone came with like a sheen,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the party with, you know, a brick sheen
like that, we'd be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're not going to even try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To now we look for cues, visual cues like
that to signify how good it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know that's super tripped out
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's different though too,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like the thing about it was,
I guess what I learned to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to connect to the wet hash was that foamy
like expanded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I learned to hate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I'd smoke it, when I dab it,
it would just be like, it would fuck up
[SPEAKER_02]: the hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, fuck, this is not like
being, and that was my own fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I first made bubble,
I just like finger pressing wet bubble in
[SPEAKER_02]: my hand, showing the whole world how to do
it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it literally took me like five to
10 years of being like, listen,
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucked up, stop doing this, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And people just kept doing it for years,
like just rolling up wet bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would hurt my soul so badly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, wow, like one fucking mistake,
I make while sharing this information and
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to pay this karmic debt for the next
five to 10 fucking years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people will be like, Hey dude,
check out my hash, crack this ball of hash
[SPEAKER_02]: under my nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd just be like, Oh my God,
it's like totally gone bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like this fucking guy rolled up wet
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, it sells like a wet sock
in a dirty shoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was my own, like it was like the
universe just like kept showing it to me
[SPEAKER_02]: and showing it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, like when you do
educate people, you should be careful that
[SPEAKER_02]: you educate yourself first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did start a little early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably should have just done the process
for four or five years and then started
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead I taught everyone my mistakes
for four or five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I learned them myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was, I think there was a time on
the forums that, you know, things were
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling at a really fast pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I remember when we met on the
forums, we were weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just think like threads happened fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were trying stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and we were mainly washing in
smaller bag systems then because our plant
[SPEAKER_00]: counts were so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just was a totally different time,
you know, like things moved at such a slow
[SPEAKER_00]: pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, yeah, your information that came
out was like, it just like happened until
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, all I know is I was like the only
motherfucker with Full Mount out of every
[SPEAKER_02]: single person I always met ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the people I met after with
Full Mount were all people that I turned
[SPEAKER_02]: on, made hash with and got, you know,
like turned them onto the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was what an incredible blessing to
be allowed to be a part of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm telling you, I showed I
personally for sure showed hundreds,
[SPEAKER_02]: if not over a thousand people in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll never forget pulling that bag,
you know, the gold bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be the first bag that like a
chunk would come out and people's,
[SPEAKER_02]: I called it the eyebrow raise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just see people like this, and then they
go, their eyes would go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, that's right,
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because before that, when you're pouring
the water and the ice in, into the bucket,
[SPEAKER_02]: no one can wrap their head around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, you fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're not supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the stupidest fucking thing you
could do to cured weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome Addison, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're feeling better, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a little better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got a, I guess I got like a, it's from my
diet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's from eating carnivore and all that
stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess you can get like these pockets
in your intestine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I don't like salad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like fucking grains or any of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I've got those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you need some fiber, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now they're like, the doctors just
like, look, some people need to eat kale
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So listen, I will say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kale can be delicious when, when prepared
properly and it's bitter when it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: prepared properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get some like awesome,
like kale Caesar salad or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I got it all figured out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of walk that fine line because
I like that diet so much, but this is the
[SPEAKER_07]: first time that I ever got like a,
this acute diverticulitis, which is,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you can get these like pockets,
I guess, in your intestine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but nothing major.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's minor.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a liquid diet for a couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, so mostly like bone broth and
electrolytes and stuff like that for like
[SPEAKER_07]: two or three days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then everything's good, but yeah,
nothing major.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we were giving you much praise
earlier, brother, just talking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: legends, talking about, we haven't heard
from Cache yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll kind of probably tell us his story
next, but we've been talking to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Oklahoma guys and in great detail of their
journey and how it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Rob, I guess from Sensi Mag that
turned you on to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
Ron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron was real helpful with when I reached
out to him, you know, cause we wanted to
[SPEAKER_07]: have makers from more places, you know,
and especially in places where we feel
[SPEAKER_07]: like they've established, you know,
they've done a good enough job in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you get in this little pocket
and you're hunting and you've got the,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the, the, the blessing of the
state and you're doing all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's, you're in your little
pocket and you're away from everybody
[SPEAKER_07]: else.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's stuff that just kind of builds
over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Oklahoma, and especially the
guys that skunk or just proof of that,
[SPEAKER_07]: that, you know, guys are going to get
ahold of genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to get ahold of tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're, they're looking at all the same
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just because they're in a place,
you know, that's not where you are,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's cause they're in Oklahoma or they're
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't mean they're not making fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think they proved that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, you know, same with Ace Lure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think my, my favorite entry of the
entire event was number three from Ace
[SPEAKER_07]: Lure, which I think was like a gelato or
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but yeah, it's just, you know,
and Ace Lure is from St. Louis,
[SPEAKER_07]: Missouri of all places.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, yeah, it was cool this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned that from the bags, dude,
everyone, cause people will be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: where's the best hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, wherever I am, dude,
because I carry these bags with me and I
[SPEAKER_02]: roll and I make cash wherever I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course people are growing dank weed
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to find those people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause what people do is they go somewhere
and they were like, yeah, I went to
[SPEAKER_02]: so-and-so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking weed sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be like, correction, your ability
to find good weed sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore you found bad weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, everywhere has great stuff and,
uh, all you have to do is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: make the hash, press the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're, if you've got, if you've got a
hold of those genetics, which I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can buy them from seed banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you need some special clone
or something gifted down from the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: gods.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pull phenols right out of these
bags, bags of seed that you can buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you need knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need the network and you just need the
desire to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's everyone we,
everyone we met and everyone we meet has
[SPEAKER_07]: all those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're not afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: People always think, people always think
knowledge comes from the mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no, wisdom comes from the
mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowledge comes from your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you were saying earlier, it was so
counterintuitive to take material and add
[SPEAKER_07]: it with ice and water.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, what are you fucking doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then even the dry sip methods are kind
of counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's, you know, when you walk
people down that direction and they see
[SPEAKER_07]: it, um, it's crazy now because there just
seems to be so much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then even for guys like us,
which, you know, we understand the
[SPEAKER_07]: microns, we understand, um, you know,
what they're pulling.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as the rosin in the hash world is
getting more and more mature, meaning
[SPEAKER_07]: that, you know, more consumers are having
access to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're watching.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're watching consumers get duped in a
way, um, you know, because they are,
[SPEAKER_07]: they are happy to and unknowingly going to
smoke on some 45U or some 25U or a mix of
[SPEAKER_07]: those other microns.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to be like, Hey,
this is hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to be like, when we clean
the banger, we're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: what the hell's going on here?
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's that little learning curve
that's kind of there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we watched it here in
California over the last three years,
[SPEAKER_07]: four years where people were like,
well, I can get rosin for much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, then they start to get it from
where they're getting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they realized like, Oh,
this is, this is like the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_07]: barrel stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: The stuff that I tried with them with
those guys and that little sash,
[SPEAKER_07]: that shit's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do I get that?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, Oh, well, that's this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, you pay for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's levels to it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's levels to it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that's the beautiful thing
about hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, it's dynamic and there's people
who still love their traditional hashes
[SPEAKER_02]: and press.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pressing it and feeling it and crumbling
it up and smoking it in joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to admit, I don't smoke a lot of it,
but when I smell it in the air,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Oh shit, you're smoking some of
that hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just reminds me of, you know,
being younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did smoke a lot of hash back in
those days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a journey and you see them on
the path and you're like, Oh, you're on
[SPEAKER_07]: the path.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you go back to your, your house
and you're like, I got my timer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my fucking temp thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my dunk tank.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the slurpers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, but we're sociopaths,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the, Hey, I want to hear from
cache.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, how, how, what was legends like
for you, brother?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, uh, half our team was coming
straight from MJ BizCon, which was,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, what an absolutely dynamic,
like what, so that's like, you went to
[SPEAKER_02]: Chad con and then you went to legends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a completely different experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously I think you did it in the right
order.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we ran through MJ BizCon as fast as
you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, met the people that we've
done business with and all that kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, it's wild, you know, going
through these events for five,
[SPEAKER_06]: 10, 15 years, you run into the same people
and they're like, Oh, you're not with this
[SPEAKER_06]: company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you see these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, you know, for us, we end up just
talking to people that we know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but it was, you know, so that was
cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but it was a challenge, uh,
you know, kind of changing over to legends
[SPEAKER_06]: of past sheesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, uh, I, uh, I think we
probably underestimated how, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: how many, you know, entries we were going
to have to go through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I don't think we, uh, prepared
adequately for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but let me just tell you, there is no
adequate preparation for that actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's psychotic and it just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like having kids when people are
like, Oh, I wish I could have prepared
[SPEAKER_02]: more for having kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you can't just have them and
they're psychotic and then you just figure
[SPEAKER_02]: it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as legends of hash, it's,
it makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I do want to say,
um, you know, we've done a lot of events
[SPEAKER_06]: over the years and, um, this was a very,
very cool, very special kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, you know, uh, you know,
we feel super honored to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I just think there's a lot of
like little details that were really,
[SPEAKER_06]: really cool that, you know, how you just
don't really see it events like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the specific giveaway stuff that
I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like our team has, you know, all this
legends of hash stuff that we get to use
[SPEAKER_06]: over the year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and, um, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I was able to get some
stuff and bring it home to my wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she gets to use it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, so I think that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the stuff that you guys chose to give
away was all like really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was not just like mids giveaway
stuff that you normally get.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, how the boots were set up
was really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, we, you know, we, we've known
Scott for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's kind of, uh, our,
you know, kind of inroad into this event.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just kind of cool seeing him
out in the wild, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: doing his thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, um, I thought that that was
really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: For everyone to like see the man himself
and be able to like thash with him and
[SPEAKER_06]: like everyone else there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was kind of like right in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, dude, he's kind of like the skunk man,
Sam, in a sense, you know, cause Sam was
[SPEAKER_02]: always that very same thing at the early
legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were just like, Oh my God,
that's him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just kind of a crazy character,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just, you know, and it's also Sam
was like kept to himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't go out a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like always head down in the
greenhouse kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sort of just suddenly see him
absolutely like a kid in a fucking candy
[SPEAKER_02]: store, just chuffing hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suspect Scott was a similar way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I've seen both, I have to admit that
they are very alike in some ways where
[SPEAKER_07]: like Scott, Scott's, you know,
everyone is just giving him hash and
[SPEAKER_07]: talking to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's kind of like, Oh, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_07]: And Oh, what's over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's just having so much fun,
but he did tell me this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, he's like, listen, we need to spread
out this judging because this was too
[SPEAKER_07]: much.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like this, and I'm like, if it's too
much for you, I'll definitely take your
[SPEAKER_07]: advice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I know he, I've seen him run
gauntlets on like 18 rigs and just,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you, we did have the intention of
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just didn't work out and it wasn't
anything on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, uh, it was difficult to get the
entries on time to be able to offer them a
[SPEAKER_02]: week early to everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll explain the issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what happened was when I built the
timeline, just like a goofball,
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't realize that when I was going to
be making that point of contact with all
[SPEAKER_07]: of the makers, it was during harvest
season.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're going to do now to adjust
is, um, and I guess we can announce it
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to move legends to January,
um, for LA.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that way we kind of have our own
space.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we timeline it back, um,
everything we're going to need to do with
[SPEAKER_07]: those makers is going to be in December,
uh, which is a lot better for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that way we'll be able to get the
rosin judging done at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and all those things that we planned
on doing, it was my, it was my fault
[SPEAKER_07]: because I obviously was doing so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't realize where it fell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but now, uh, we'll be able to do it in
January, which means that for legends
[SPEAKER_07]: 2024, there will not be a Los Angeles
legends 2024.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be in, uh, January of 2025.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to say one thing instead of
a swag bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think legends of hash gives away 90
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we should call our swag bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's call it from now on the 90 you bag,
which is an interesting, those
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfuckers at legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought there was going to be a 90
you from you there, Marcus, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: a nice 44 gallon for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm telling you, I got to represent
with bubble bags next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way more.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not next year, but the year after,
you know what he said, January close to.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the, the way that the gift bags work
out, cause I have this hair across my ass
[SPEAKER_07]: with gift bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, I go to these events and they
give you this gift bag and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: literally, you're literally most of the
time you just want to hand it back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's a, it's a really low ball attempt
at marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's kind of like a, it's kind of
just like a, I look at it as like a
[SPEAKER_07]: distraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, Oh, here's a weird bag that you
get to carry around with a bunch of shit
[SPEAKER_07]: that you probably don't want.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we kept our, we kept our agreement to
the companies because we haphazardly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Promoted them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with us, it's more of, um, we really
take a long time to make sure that each
[SPEAKER_07]: company that we're choosing and selecting
and working with does have a product
[SPEAKER_07]: that's going to be helpful, useful,
something we haven't seen before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then we do our own stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, uh, like, you know, Zara was talking
about, like we have the, we did the
[SPEAKER_07]: little, uh, tool stands, which came from,
which came from like eating dinner and
[SPEAKER_07]: we're eating dinner at a spot in LA.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you leave there,
you flip over your little chopstick stand
[SPEAKER_07]: and it says, I stole this from whatever
the name of the restaurant is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, Oh, this is a fucking
great idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I took it and I used it as a dab stand
for awhile.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then I was like, this is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it kind of puts us on there on their
table.
[SPEAKER_07]: They see our logo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so it was just kind of a great idea
and they're, they're inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not super costly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but that we put in the Sonicators,
we put in the, um, the magic carpets,
[SPEAKER_07]: which we did with, um, with some people
from out of country.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we're super stoked, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those bags come together in a really cool
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course the sponsors,
like seven, 10 labs and dab or doc and
[SPEAKER_07]: chill it and all these guys that come
forward, um, and make sure that we have
[SPEAKER_07]: the products DNA and, and Crockett.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, when you're getting that
much stuff in your gift bag, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we, we, we deconstructed a gift
bag and I think we're going to release,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, in some, some, we're going to send out
some, uh, some content.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll put up some content that'll show
like what the actual value of the gift
[SPEAKER_07]: bags is, but I think we're going to now
refer to them as the 90 you bags,
[SPEAKER_07]: which I think is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to DNA too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they, uh, they were super nice to us
and, uh, uh, we've been running their
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was nice to catch up with them and
get some new gear too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, that was dope.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had some great genetics too,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the, what they did, if you saw what
they did, they took honey banana,
[SPEAKER_07]: which won the rosin last year and they
just smashed everything with runny banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a fun one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be some nice things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's already some stuff that spun
off of it because the, um, the guys at
[SPEAKER_07]: mills, Chris, uh, Chris and those guys at
mills AB, they've already, they had that
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff early and they were cutting Z into
all that stuff too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now there's a bunch of these other ones
that I saw that AZ that AB has that are
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of using some of those, like the,
the strawberry, um, the strawberry and the
[SPEAKER_07]: honey banana.
[SPEAKER_07]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I got to shout out my buddy,
Dan, who he's got these 3d printers and he
[SPEAKER_02]: 3d printed this little dryer that you like
put your banger into and it plugs in
[SPEAKER_02]: through a USB and then it like dries your
banger after you dunk it in the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little banger dryer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's it right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little banger dryer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to have these inserts cause I've
got little 10, 10 mils.
[SPEAKER_02]: JPs there, but, uh, what a cool little
product that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much innovation.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were messing around with, um,
when we were looking at the dad's dad tool
[SPEAKER_07]: stands and some of the other stuff,
uh, we found these hearing aid dryers that
[SPEAKER_07]: you, that were these little tiny hearing
aid dryers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like you pop the top open and it was
mesh basket inside and you would drop your
[SPEAKER_07]: hearing aid in there and close it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would had a fan on the bottom that
would blow up through it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were, we were sourcing these things,
but I kept breaking them and I was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: that could not find a good source for
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I want it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause a banger would fit in there with
your stuff and you could close it up and
[SPEAKER_07]: it would just blow air through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But well, that's basically what this is
doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great looking product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, cache, how was, uh, did you guys
get over to ego clash afterward?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we did not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, uh, definitely kind of,
uh, for us, it was a little bit under the
[SPEAKER_06]: radar.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we're kind of just late to,
to even finding out about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're pretty late to, uh,
legends as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't, we, we weren't the ones holding
it all up, but, uh, no, you guys killed
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you know how it goes, I think,
you know, shout out to all the other
[SPEAKER_06]: competitors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause especially from, excuse me,
you know, from, from Oklahoma and New
[SPEAKER_06]: York, it sounds like, uh, uh, the
logistics there are, uh, significantly
[SPEAKER_06]: more difficult than what we have to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in LA.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, uh, uh, huge congratulations to
you guys because we've been through it,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, trying to do an event and,
you know, around the country and,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that, that is, uh, extremely difficult
to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, huge congratulations,
Chris and Colin and Logan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's a little bit easier for you
down there, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, that, that is, um, something to be
proud of.
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously you guys' entries were fire
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of heat, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, Colin.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was, uh, it was good to see you up
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and I just, you gave me that jar when
I left and I held onto it and I actually
[SPEAKER_07]: was looking last night, I was going to
take a dab and I'm like, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the, I got the winner right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got to try that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was really nice, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's different than what I gave you
is actually different than what I won
[SPEAKER_00]: with, but it's still in the same,
what I would consider the same gas
[SPEAKER_00]: category, but still has some, like some
complexities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like whenever you try it, like try it at
different tents, it's like gassy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also like tropical, floral,
smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's interesting, but, um,
yeah, I appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the vent, like just kind of go in on
that a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, was amazing for so many reasons,
you know, from looking at it from last
[SPEAKER_00]: year to this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year was great, but this year I felt
like I had a better layout and the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: bar was really focused and it just had a
really good flow to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was good to see Don and
Aaron, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I picked up their, the pack that
they had, they, they hooked me up on that
[SPEAKER_00]: and got some other, other single packs
from them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really stoked to put that into the,
into the greenhouses this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but overall, I mean, it just,
I think, I thought the judging was much
[SPEAKER_00]: better this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like it, it really was really
honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just, you didn't, you just had no
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, to be honest, like completely
forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know what our number was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to call my cousin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yo, like what number are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that was even after the fact,
cause I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good to go through it and just kind
of be methodical and really give everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: the time of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also agree with Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I understand the circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, uh, I, you know, I can,
you know, I love hash, so I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: will, will, will definitely go through it
all, but it was, uh, I do use like three
[SPEAKER_00]: different rigs to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I used an e-rig a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went back to my, my room,
um, later in the night and it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just using a regular rig and yeah,
but it was, there was some really dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone out there, man, like congrats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, skunk, you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had really great entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, really enjoyed yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I remember years specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when someone asked me, I was talking
to Alex, I think from hashtag about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so really good job guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out, shout out to Alex to the,
the, just the, just having him there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think just having like the energy
that he brings with his team and how
[SPEAKER_07]: they're cutting the videos and like,
he's really leading the way with like day
[SPEAKER_07]: two, we woke up and he had a video cut
from day one that was running that
[SPEAKER_07]: morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, he was really on top of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to those guys, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: They, they do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, you know, there are certain
things this year that we tried to really
[SPEAKER_07]: narrow down on and focus on.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them was the hash bar.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other was, um, the layout.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's good to hear people, um,
recognizing some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, you know, that it's,
it's not hard to be prepared and to lay it
[SPEAKER_07]: all out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we, we spent a little more this
year on production and then the actual
[SPEAKER_07]: like team of producing the event.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that paid off a lot for us too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it gave us the ability to,
to put on an event that we had all the
[SPEAKER_07]: boxes checked.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of the major components that made
it so great was that we really didn't have
[SPEAKER_07]: any makers that were late or that were
holding us up or that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: causing problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, you know, that'll happen
sometimes because you got logistics and
[SPEAKER_07]: you got so many different moving parts.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for this year, it was, I mean,
didn't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after the event didn't have a
single maker have any issues or
[SPEAKER_07]: complaints.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, we had one little hiccup
where the judges boxes that we ordered,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, because there was an issue with
printing and they weren't, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: honest about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually didn't derive on time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're shipping those out now,
but it gives us like that little comet
[SPEAKER_07]: tail to be able to reach back out and send
those to you guys, as well as the,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, the new product, uh, Carta is
launching a brand new product that they're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to send out to each one of the
judges.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, it gives us a little touch point
after the event.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, and sometimes you can turn those
lemons and lemonade, make it good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so it was, uh, but best year yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've even talking to Meredith,
even talking to golden, um, we had,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, just great sponsors,
great makers, everything worked out.
[SPEAKER_07]: The guests were amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone, you know, didn't have any
issues, any trouble.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I think we might've bent the gate
a little bit with, uh, with some mistakes
[SPEAKER_07]: that we made.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, we'll pay for that,
but, uh, everything else, man,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was really, uh, you know, from all the
work that we put into it, when it all
[SPEAKER_07]: works out and when everyone has a blast,
it's just the hugest payoff ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got to thank everyone, um,
you know, for coming out and doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's nothing better than,
um, tormenting your friends with hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's nothing better than,
uh, putting the boys through the gauntlet
[SPEAKER_07]: or the ringer and, you know, watch putting
the fear of God into Debbie kind of seeing
[SPEAKER_07]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you the funniest one honestly was
Darby because every time I'd go see Darby,
[SPEAKER_07]: he'd just be like, Oh man, this is so
great.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're just having so much fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: JP is a monster though.
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy can smoke hash like nothing I've
ever seen in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, shout out to those guys too,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all made awards.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we had the great, you know,
section of the award ceremony when they
[SPEAKER_07]: were giving stuff out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think every person that won anything
from them was just blown away with what
[SPEAKER_07]: the actual prizes were and what they got.
[SPEAKER_07]: So nothing like getting a hand blown,
you know, trophy from anyone of those
[SPEAKER_07]: three guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to them and shout out to the
winners for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, to close out my thoughts
on the event, I think it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, I'm excited to see what you guys are
able to do next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, thanks so much for the
invite again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there was steep out there,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of good entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and big shout out to Brian from
best friend farms, who, uh, is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: working with us in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, is that who put in the material
you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had part of the material we grew
ourselves, which we have our own living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Brian contributed some material
that we, we grew or he grew indoor living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, um, called gas mask and gas mask was
a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We blended with two other, uh,
really one other batch that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, it's like, I'd say it was a,
the quarter of the batch was, was the gas
[SPEAKER_00]: mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, uh, it adds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice, it's a really good varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian's a super talented grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the material was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just, yeah, it just was meant to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's funny cause I was telling
Marcus, like we did a batch just with
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian that was meant for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we watched it, I called
Brian, I was like, it's just, isn't it
[SPEAKER_00]: like for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went back in and, uh, my cousin and I
kind of, kind of came up with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the rest of the team.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great work, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, uh, it was one of those situations
where I think just putting it all together
[SPEAKER_07]: and at all working out was perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I've talked to a bunch of
people afterward that are, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, some people want to compare
legends to other events and, or compare
[SPEAKER_07]: other events to other events.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's, it's kind of slippery
slope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because why would you do that when you can
attend both events and have a great time?
[SPEAKER_07]: They might be different speeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: They might be at different places.
[SPEAKER_07]: They might have different formats,
but, um, you know, you, you get out of it,
[SPEAKER_07]: what you put into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you go into it with a good attitude
and you go into it with, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: with the desire to meet people and have
fun and, and rip some turps and have a
[SPEAKER_07]: blast.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's, it's afterward,
uh, or, or the people that I think don't
[SPEAKER_07]: enjoy themselves that want to criticize
and, and try to draw these dividing lines.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the same thing in politics right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same thing, you know,
in wars and other shit, everyone wants you
[SPEAKER_07]: to kind of decide.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, we're not, we don't have
that issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not politics.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not any of those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just go and have fun and smoke hash and
have a great time, whether it's at ego,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it's at legends, whether it's at
the hash ball, whether it's at a local
[SPEAKER_07]: thing where you're going to, um,
because you know, the more you do that and
[SPEAKER_07]: have a good time and have a great attitude
and a good energy toward it, the better
[SPEAKER_07]: the event is for everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then the more fun you have.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get good hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a great time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not one to compare.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I was bummed that I didn't get to get
up to ego clash.
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually, uh, I enjoy, uh, those types
of events, you know, but I just,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was my daughter's birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I wasn't able to make it up to it,
but, uh, I sent the message to Brandon and
[SPEAKER_07]: we talked a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and I know they killed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they had a great event.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it was probably one of their
biggest ones they've ever had.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yeah, love, you know, love to those
guys and, and shout out to anyone who's
[SPEAKER_07]: doing an event because I know how much
goes into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know how many, how many things can go
wrong and then how you deal with those
[SPEAKER_07]: things are really going to determine
whether or not you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_07]: successful event.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we teach you doing these events.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you know, there was a period of time
there for everyone that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're like, fuck, this will never happen
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, uh, you know, big props to you and
everyone else throwing these events again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you know, the culture, you know,
there was definitely, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: a fear that would really kind of go to the
wayside and especially, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and in California, so, um, yeah,
I'm stoked that, uh, these are happening
[SPEAKER_06]: again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or to, or that it goes to like profiteers,
like people who are just putting on
[SPEAKER_07]: minimal infrastructure and you know,
there's card tape, there's card tables and
[SPEAKER_07]: shit's just kind of more like a sesh,
which, which still has its place.
[SPEAKER_07]: A sesh is a great place to go and get,
you know, find some deals and find some
[SPEAKER_07]: great stuff and see who you like.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, we try to provide something that
just has every corner, every turn would
[SPEAKER_07]: impress us, would make us kind of,
you know, say, oh, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we stayed in nice hotels and
we've been to great events and we've done
[SPEAKER_07]: those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, the food is something that I think
I wanted to ask you guys about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I, I, I personally get to set the
entire menu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so that's a lot of stuff that I like,
and that's probably why I have this,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, this gut issue, but, um, I just wanted
to get some feedback from you guys about
[SPEAKER_07]: the food.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think about the food?
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think about that stuff?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I'll go, uh, first, I guess,
um, I think the food was really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I don't think there, um,
it could have been food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put it to you like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there was like a fire taco stand,
um, I would have been totally down for
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, um, I am a simple guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe, um, some of those flavors were
more than, um, I wanted to challenge my
[SPEAKER_06]: body with that event.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but yeah, I think, um, I think it was
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a bunch of my team had some.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, I think if you, if I was to have
a suggestion, um, and this is a logistical
[SPEAKER_06]: nightmare, uh, before, uh, before I say it
is like, you know, how can you get maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: one or two or three food trucks with
different cuisines?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could appeal to like different
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I think, you know, if that's something
logistically, that's a nightmare,
[SPEAKER_06]: but, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just personally, that's something I would
never do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the, the food truck kind of
creates a vibe.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's definitely, I mean, you're standing
there and there's a, there's three or four
[SPEAKER_07]: lines now and there's, you know,
the food truck can run out of food and you
[SPEAKER_07]: have less control.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's when you're delivering that much
food to somebody, you have to have,
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to understand all of it and
what's going to go out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So food trucks, I think are dope.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just something that I don't think
we'll ever do, but, um, and there's also a
[SPEAKER_07]: reason for the menu.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason for the menu is also,
uh, Marcus originally did it in a Lebanese
[SPEAKER_07]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we wanted that's Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the Marcus half is like to have
Lebanese food and to pick a great
[SPEAKER_07]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So legends started in a Lebanese
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to have a Lebanese food.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I bring in from my childhood of
skateboarding and being an asshole in
[SPEAKER_07]: Boston, we used to go to these,
um, we'd go to these, uh, big brunches at
[SPEAKER_07]: the these huge hotels and there'd be like
20 of us and we'd be all roasted and we'd
[SPEAKER_07]: go in there and just like eat and then
take a bunch of croissants with us and
[SPEAKER_07]: leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was kind of part of, that's my
addition to it is like, well, brunch is
[SPEAKER_07]: the greatest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so that's kind of how the two menus
come together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but taco, I just got a thing about
taco trucks where I've been to too many
[SPEAKER_07]: events and there's like a hamburger truck
and a taco truck.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just kind of, I feel like,
uh, it's not like a sit down thing to eat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want people to have like,
sit down and enjoy hash and sit down and
[SPEAKER_07]: enjoy food.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so that's kind of why we go in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we can, we can of course
figure out things that are a little more
[SPEAKER_07]: simple, but that's why we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you went, there's a fruit bar that has
cut fruit the whole time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has drinks, it has tea, it has water.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like a little oasis that just
has more simple stuff to kind of keep you,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, recharged and charged while you're
doing the event.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could probably add.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you looked over there, there were
like a lot of finger foods.
[SPEAKER_07]: And stuff that was going out on that other
side, um, over by the hash bar,
[SPEAKER_07]: we had like a massive section that we were
serving other food at.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I definitely missed that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was in a, in a, in a cloud of
smoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's where the definitely didn't
see that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the same spot that we had all the
drinks.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a massive drink bar that was
all to the left of the hash bar and that
[SPEAKER_07]: whole entire wall after the GZ art
display, there was a huge, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: spread there that had all the fruit,
all the pastries, all the cookies and
[SPEAKER_07]: snacks and all that stuff was served out
there all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a little finger food and
stuff like that, that was on that table as
[SPEAKER_07]: well.
So.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think maybe some user error on my,
on my, uh, uh, not figuring out where that
[SPEAKER_06]: was.
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of like, did you drink anything?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you drink anything while you were
there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, like, uh, alcohol was no, like all
that, cause we had all the beverages.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's a massive beverage station
that was to the left of the bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't sure if you were able to,
man, I don't know how I could have
[SPEAKER_06]: possibly not seen that, but I have an idea
of how you didn't see so much after Vegas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I drank for a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be rough.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was, uh, what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, go ahead, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I was just going to say in
regards to your last conversation,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you know, the way you could
marry, uh, what you had replied to him,
[SPEAKER_02]: Addison in regards to Lea, like,
the whole food truck lineup idea is a
[SPEAKER_02]: bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the food trucks are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lineup part is a bummer, but imagine
that you had a taco truck or two and you
[SPEAKER_02]: had them parked out back, but no one was
going up to those trucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just hammering out tacos nonstop
and filling trays that were then brought
[SPEAKER_02]: into the place, put down just like they
would be any of the other food and people
[SPEAKER_02]: just grab them that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's always solutions to these
things is all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I agree with, uh, both of what
you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, yes, legends of hashish had
Lebanese food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in a Lebanese restaurant for 13
plus years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, it certainly won't have
to be Lebanese food forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could, we could revisit different menus
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, like Addison said, take in
intake, people's opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great to send out a little
questionnaire about this Addison and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what kind of numbers we could get in
regards to all, all of the things like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how did you like the cereal bar?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of the, the,
you know, the little oasis?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of, you know,
the, the, the menu?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of the hash bar?
[SPEAKER_02]: All these different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told them earlier, before you came in,
I'd love to hear some positive things that
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to say about legends,
but we'd love to hear anything that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: help fix it as well, because there's
that's really where the real value is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to get like, Oh, let's all Pat
Addison on his back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he fucking crushed it so hard,
but it's also nice to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey dude, if we just do this a little
differently, it could even, we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it better every year is basically
where I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how we did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we, what you saw in year two was
us taking the feedback from year one.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you saw here in year three was us
taking feedback from year two.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, you know, we're already,
you know, Marcus, you and I are already
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about other stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we can talk about that at some
point, but I might, I might've fucked it
[SPEAKER_02]: up earlier and said something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You talked about what?
[SPEAKER_02]: About, you know, rocking legends in,
in Barca.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, that's, that's actually,
that's scary for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like, I'm, I'm excited,
but at the same time, I'm a little scared
[SPEAKER_02]: because I like to imagine how it was when
I just did it out of my pocket and just
[SPEAKER_02]: like try, like wasn't from Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to be renting venues and chairs
and tables and all this crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just like super stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's in euros.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a Canadian standpoint,
it's like, Oh, how much is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a thousand euros.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Oh, so like 1800 Canadian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every, every bill, every bill was like
double the bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paying for everything with no sponsors
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even my own company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was, we'll crush this out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the right people on our side and I
think it'll be nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be anything like what
you've put together in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be Barcelona style.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be more intimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be, you know, be what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent time with him at, at legends and I
gave him some, a couple of dabs of some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some fresh press and think a couple of,
I think some of the stuff that both Marcus
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lorenzo is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top-notch dude, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I remember when he came on the scene,
I remember literally like I met him quite
[SPEAKER_02]: a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be as, as many as 10 years ago at
this point, maybe at so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure exactly where he's just one
of those really cool Italian guys that I
[SPEAKER_02]: clicked with right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he just climbed and climbed and
now we had, you know, he's got a shop in
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got this beautiful Terps army in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, he's working it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got two shops now, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to working with those
guys and figuring out how to pull this
[SPEAKER_07]: off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty, it's definitely, it's going
to be exciting and fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like in three days, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll see.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm definitely, I like to do things a
little more, a little more laid out and
[SPEAKER_07]: planned, but at the same time,
I definitely trust the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have, we have good teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have like spots for people to meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get a great spot,
the food and the everything will be really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll make sure we get invites out to
all the, all the good hash makers that
[SPEAKER_02]: want to make their appearance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a jump off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got, I've got to go pick up some
medication and deal with some other stuff,
[SPEAKER_07]: but, and my stomach is killing me right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I do appreciate everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to jump in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize that I've, oddly, I got this
weird issue that kind of came up out of
[SPEAKER_07]: nowhere, but yeah, I got to get going,
not feeling so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to jump off, but thank you
guys all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm looking forward to working with
Marcus and putting some more stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, peace out brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're feeling better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't, we haven't heard from Alex
Gonzo in the room here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came in a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: How we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: We doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a little bit about yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know you were off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, you're, you're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just jump on video.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcus, we met at Ego.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, I'm Calix.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were the packaging sponsor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuckin' A, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Through the haze of all the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had a good time with Legends?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, unreal.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys were talking about what was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of my favorite parts was the,
the cereal bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: The minis, the mini aspects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like whoever thought of that, dude,
killed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to have little things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even the little lattes with like
the glob mops and legends, like stencils
[SPEAKER_02]: on top of the lattes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just so fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Addison really went above and beyond and
got some, some cool concepts and ideas to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you got to do a lot,
a lot of those little things to make it a
[SPEAKER_02]: special evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, nowadays there's just so
many different things that bombard the
[SPEAKER_02]: senses that, you know, from the
perspective of Legends, it's all about
[SPEAKER_02]: curating the right products, the right
sponsors, the right hash makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like curators and we're creating a
living art gallery of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what Legends of Hash is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happens for a night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, wouldn't it be an amazing thing
one day to see like Legends of Hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: just dispensaries with like the hash bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the whole, like the little cereal
bars, like the whole concept just put into
[SPEAKER_02]: a baller dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you want to feel like what it was
like to be at this event, like go to that
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't even call it a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would call it like a hash bar,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to go to the Legends of Hash hash
bar, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That place is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone in that city would want their
dabs in that hash bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had a good Legends anyway,
is what you're saying with the cereal bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think whatever we can keep doing to
curate those like little points of
[SPEAKER_05]: experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these hash makers are putting,
you know, everything they can into making
[SPEAKER_05]: the best product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this whole event, like, I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we try and do with our
packaging, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the user experience and making sure
that everybody has a positive interaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you kill it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like with the stencil, it's like those
little things, the little moments that
[SPEAKER_05]: stand out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you can put a bunch of those
together the whole time, it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: ah, the detail here and there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the effort put into the event,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, yeah, crushed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's up, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll continue to try, you know,
like one of my ideas was to always have
[SPEAKER_02]: like, at the end of Legends, I used to go
with this guy, Sid, and Sid has a hubbly
[SPEAKER_02]: bubbly collection of pipes from
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you open the book Hashish, there's
pictures in the middle of Rob's book
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in those pictures, you'll see these
hubbly bubbly pipes, these Afghani pipes
[SPEAKER_02]: that are like, you know, two, three feet
tall, big long pipe on them and your big
[SPEAKER_02]: bowl on this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a serious hash smoker tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a much bigger rip than a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a big dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a huge dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, Sid would bring one of
these down to Legends and it would be like
[SPEAKER_02]: a hundred years old and he'd let us all
puff on it for the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was this real honor to be able to
smoke this pipe from Afghanistan in
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam from Sid's collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end, I'd just be trashed,
especially because like all the dead smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: in the original restaurant, it was such a
small environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be rebreathing the smoky air,
which was terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go up to his house and this guy would
have like 10 or 15 different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: honey from all around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd start, you know, have a spoonful
of this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just, I couldn't believe how well
it cleared my throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a hash smoker, I always want to
have a honey bar where you can go up and
[SPEAKER_02]: get a little honey and just have access to
honey because honey will get you back on
[SPEAKER_02]: the dabs like nobody's business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you've got a sore, wretched
throat, a spoonful of the right honey from
[SPEAKER_02]: the right environment, is so medicinal you
can't even fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Peruvian honey that he gave me a
tiny teaspoon and it went down my throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, dude, I feel like I
could go do another Legends now,
[SPEAKER_02]: legitimately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wished, you know, I knew it was
kind of going to play out this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my email probably went to a lot of
people's junk mails and I could have
[SPEAKER_02]: probably done a better job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been nice to have all the
other winners as well as Darby and Scott
[SPEAKER_02]: and JP.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we'll do another one here in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good for another little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys have anything else you want to
talk about in regards to your brands,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you guys are at with your brands,
what you're doing, you know, any of that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff you're welcome to mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're obviously towards the end,
we'll tell everyone your social media so
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone can follow you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a couple hundred people watching in
the room and there should be a,
[SPEAKER_02]: five or 6,000 people that watch this
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be worth getting your social
medias out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone brand action, activities,
sales, where you're at, where people can
[SPEAKER_02]: get your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about our launch as a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are taking Vessel Life Science into New
York as a brand and we've got a license
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're super stoked to start it in 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got cultivation and manufacturing
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're stoked man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a long time coming,
super important for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't really intend for Vessel
Life Science to become a brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't think many people intend many
things to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're stoked to just be a part of the
wave and just be a valuable vessel for
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great to hear, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Casey Bunn says we want to know more about
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Casey.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hilarious, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just want to shout out to all the
patients of Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, without them, we wouldn't be
able to operate and we wouldn't be around.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we really appreciate them, first of
all, you know, foremost for, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: really appreciating good hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, it's crazy the kind of
community that's actually like out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people generally in like,
you know, genuinely care about quality,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, over quantity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know like there's a lot of booth out
here too, but there is, there's actually
[SPEAKER_08]: quite a good market for hash and all that,
you know, rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people out here that,
you know, take it as a passion.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we're real small, you know,
it's just my brother and I.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have one full-time helper and
then a couple part-time helpers too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I mean, we're just going to keep
doing this for Oklahoma as long as we can.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it ever goes wreck out
here or whatever, but yeah, just going to
[SPEAKER_08]: keep the slow growth going and keep making
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Oklahoma's lucky to have you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're lucky to have Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys do that Donnie burger cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, yeah, that was the one that won
the first yet, uh, first place and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, yeah, you guys did the cross though,
or did you get that?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a pack from California seed bank,
respected California seed bank.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, yeah, we just, uh, we actually
got a couple, uh, freebies.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was like two, three pack
freebies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we just popped all those at once.
[SPEAKER_08]: We Fino hunt everything that we,
uh, bro, we don't, we, we've never taken
[SPEAKER_08]: any cuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I think we were just like paranoid
years ago that, you know, for bugs or
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever reason, and just, you know,
black market stuff kind of wanting to stay
[SPEAKER_08]: hidden or whatever, um, a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just something.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just always liked to hunt.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was, uh, the initial time,
the, the, the first Fino hunt wash.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was like five Finos is a five Finos
that's in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I think it adds to like a quite
complex flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Same with the rambutan, that one,
um, that's bloom seed co.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've had that one for at least a year
now, but it's still three Finos and we've
[SPEAKER_08]: narrowed that one down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of what we do is like mixed Fino
of that flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll keep a couple, um, just kind of
depending.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause we want like a nice wide range of
flavors, uh, give it a little bit of
[SPEAKER_08]: complexity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, that's just what, that's what
we love doing and on to rush things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, well, we're just going to keep doing
that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're on the right path.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking forward to the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking forward to more, uh, legends.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next time we got to spend some more time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was, I was super overwhelmed with
smoking the hash and making sure we got
[SPEAKER_08]: through all those like, you know,
like they all said, gave everybody their,
[SPEAKER_08]: their due diligence on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does become work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does become work where you're really
like, holy fuck, like this is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: like going to take me out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great though.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we do it out in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like 45 dabs, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get it fucking done.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to do more of that kind of stuff
for, uh, for Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_08]: The, the competitions out here,
man, they're, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, uh, as far as like, you know,
nice events like that sessions,
[SPEAKER_08]: we were, uh, going to throw one called
blue grass and hash later this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or next year, I should say, uh,
with one of our buddies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that should be, just try to bring that
kind of culture more to Oklahoma for the
[SPEAKER_08]: people here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and what, what I would suggest you
do for that is that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to do smaller legends styles
events in different cities where we can
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of find the talent like scouting
events.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we can't, if there is events like
what you just mentioned that aligns with
[SPEAKER_02]: our sort of bottom line, we always are
down with finding like the shining stars
[SPEAKER_02]: of these events and then, you know,
inviting them into the competition of
[SPEAKER_02]: legends for the next year kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got to be able to scout hash
makers out there in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that becomes a, you know, the
responsibility of the legends of hash
[SPEAKER_02]: crew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll definitely stay in touch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I think Addison might, I think he's
been talking to our buddy Brian that's
[SPEAKER_08]: actually running it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably has he's, he's on the ball for
sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he is.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about yourself?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I just, you know, I think,
uh, I want to say thank you to,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, kind of all the supporters we
have.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, uh, you know, we're blessed to
have a decent amount of people that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, uh, fuck with us and,
um, a big shout out to our growing team.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we're all single source.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, um, we do a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a lot of, um, you know, hunting and,
um, all of that is extremely difficult and
[SPEAKER_06]: takes a lot of resources and a lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, yeah, I think, uh, this year
we're getting into, uh, we're getting like
[SPEAKER_06]: a culture lab and, um, uh, British
culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, um, that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have, um, you know, some guys
involved that, um, are kind of big in the
[SPEAKER_06]: scene and know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the most important thing you
could have said when you said we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to do a tissue culture lab, I was like,
Ooh, that's like very specialized.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you said the next thing,
which was like, we got some guys who
[SPEAKER_02]: really know what they're doing from that
exact.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most necessary component.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing a, a meristemic tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the cutting of clones, the cutting of
clones, basically really small ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the whole, you know,
uh, really clean environment and separate
[SPEAKER_06]: and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, I am not, uh, I'm personally
not the breeder of our team.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, that's not like my corner of what
we do, but, um, the guys we have on our
[SPEAKER_06]: team are really, you know, are really good
at what they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think when you kind of venture out
to the next level, you definitely have to
[SPEAKER_06]: find, you know, a mentor or somebody who
has shown that they've accomplished it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I mean, we'll see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we've done breeding for a lot of
years, just the regular way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, yeah, I'm excited to,
uh, kind of make sure our genetics are,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, as good as they can be, you know,
um, for a long period of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaning your genetics, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tissue culture definitely offers that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you, Logan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, huge shout out to my lab partner,
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Greatfully educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: On Instagram, uh, we're I'm Wolverine dabs
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we're launching dry sift onto the
Washington recreational market here in a
[SPEAKER_04]: few months, actually with, uh,
dog star and Western culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been able to find dry sift on
the market anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, you've got your hash wraps
and, uh, I haven't been able to just find
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, full melt dry sift to go
buy from a store anywhere in my area,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's going to be a lot of fun in
Canada on the legal market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can now buy a full melt bubble,
but still dry sift, full melt is not
[SPEAKER_02]: available anywhere in our country for sale
at a store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited to actually be able to
go into a store and purchase it and see it
[SPEAKER_04]: on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably going to be one of the first
customers of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guarantee you probably might be the
first, second and third, even it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you won't know what it is at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll kind of be like, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is this just some kefir?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it so expensive?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is this kefir so expensive?
[SPEAKER_03]: Congrats, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny because those Western culture
guys are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I love working with them and we're
planning on doing multiple collabs
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully, you know, and then we're
going to branch into Arizona is the next
[SPEAKER_04]: goal and go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shout out to you for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shout out to my crew in Arizona,
Arizona melts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a team up there or down there
making, making melts and live hash Rossens
[SPEAKER_02]: and they just entered the cannabis cup
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, they're doing good works.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did some really nice strawberry
melts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit looked flame on flame on,
uh, what about yourself, Alex,
[SPEAKER_02]: finish you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You let everyone know where you're at
social media and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's almost 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a perfect time to just kind of
mellow it down and to let everyone go and
[SPEAKER_02]: have a nice Sunday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've got some time to spend with my
young and sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you guys do as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no doubt guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate you having me today and shout
out all the hash makers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at legends or working on their craft
and trying to make an appearance in the
[SPEAKER_05]: future.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, uh, you guys are all here because
you are amazing and what you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we love, we love what we do.

being in agreeance with it.
