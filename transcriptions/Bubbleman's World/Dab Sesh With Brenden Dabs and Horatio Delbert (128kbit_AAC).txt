[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are here in downtown Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our special guest, Brendan Dabbs
in the house from Dablicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got many, many Dablicious stickers,
so of course we're going to show you one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course Horatio is in the house as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here at the, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cannabis Economy Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a unique type of
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening right below us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could show you later on with the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of on this little rooftop
terrace and it's quite private and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all round table events.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been different for sure, somewhat
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of one-on-ones going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to say the most interesting
conversation that I've heard since I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been here was the conversation we were all
just having about terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: modulating effects and how we've all come
to learn about these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I wanted to turn the camera
on, hoping that we would have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more of that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you guys a little introduction to
this event that we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no cameras being brought in,
but we'll still end up having a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: more sessions before it's all said and
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we just have a few dabs and
maintain our conversation that we were...
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean it didn't take long before
we're like, terpenes, danger.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know you all want them because you see
us with them, but why are we acting so
[SPEAKER_03]: conservative now that we've experienced
them?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a hard thing for any public to
swallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have a strong voice in this
because you work with the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: delimiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the first things you mentioned
to me at your house, which was not
[SPEAKER_00]: something that most people would have
mentioned, I think they would have tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to sweep it under the rug, but when I was
asking you how you would remove this
[SPEAKER_00]: orange liquid from your clear liquid and
then brought it back to a clear liquid,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were talking about what's in that
orange liquid and the sort of politically
[SPEAKER_00]: correct or not politically correct,
but the sort of the business savvy,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's protect my own ass person would have
said it in a way like, oh, those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus oils that are not delimiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the first things he said was,
that's like the mystery oil, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could be from this plastic
gasket that the delimiting comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were really aware that terpenes
can be caustic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can literally break.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met somebody downstairs at this
conference and they're like, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: you extract with hexane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I extract with cyclohexane.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, what's cyclohexane?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, oh, it's called delimiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I extract with a solvent stronger than
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand why you extract with
hexane for medical purposes, not for
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational dabs in the amounts that I'm
working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's really happy with how clean he can
get his product in the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, you know as well as I do how
much stronger hexane is than typical light
[SPEAKER_03]: hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, well then you have a
perspective on how powerful limium is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just one in an array of potential
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't respect it in the same
way, like basically you have liquid
[SPEAKER_03]: butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that powerful of a, hey, I'll just,
is that giveable?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just take all of that rubber and
incorporate it into myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't respect it in that way,
you can get really fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact that I take clear got the red.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, all of this red was invisible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone said that was clean
delimiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was food, it was food green.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, smell this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know if you put this in your body,
it ain't good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the craziest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you saw the video when I
went to Horatio's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Horatio's Intersanctum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brings me into his place and he
shows me a variety of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is the most powerful thing you can
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got clear liquid in a jar and it's
delimiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is not distilled or not cleaned
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just food gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just food gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then out of that, through his own
processes, he's extracted this nasty
[SPEAKER_00]: orange-ish red liquid that came out of the
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was left with clear again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two clears, they look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both look clear, like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the middle, he's got this jar
of like, and it is, it's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like he even showed it to me when he
allowed it to dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks so nasty, dude, that it was just
like, it's a very powerful lesson for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to, no matter what process you are
doing, because of course in our community,
[SPEAKER_00]: we support a variety of processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm known as a solventless guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the solventless quiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have friends that run hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these guys are in that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: D-limonene and butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else other than butane?
[SPEAKER_00]: Butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you also do water extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not a one-trick pony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is what we're trying to kind of
promote more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horatio is also not a one-trick pony.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes incredible dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that he has the ability to make
water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes his D-limonene extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes all of his purified THCase and
the terpene extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not trying to promote any one
thing over the other as much as really it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like the mission today and from now
on, is to unveil and uncover as many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the footprints that are leaving behind
negative aspects in any of our extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, whether it's molds from water,
whether it's rubber gaskets from
[SPEAKER_00]: D-limonene that hasn't been cleaned
properly, whether it's mercapitines
[SPEAKER_00]: present in dirty butane that was bought in
low-quality cans at a grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that need to be
discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can stop sort of dividing
ourselves from one another and sit down as
[SPEAKER_00]: a group, which we're doing right now,
it's sort of moving it forwards the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation in a greater way,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all learn from each other, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, everyone always forgets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you understand butane created
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't understand boiling points.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was all through the rise of that
era.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of why, like, when we ever get
a chance to shoot the next series of
[SPEAKER_03]: videos, I'm going to go through a whole
other side of contamination that has
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing to do with principle.
[SPEAKER_03]: The principle names, like, is butane bad?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, butane isn't bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know we've smoked a joint,
and we can help that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there are other ways in which,
if butane is run in this way, if this
[SPEAKER_03]: filter isn't cleaned often, really the
underside of bad extraction artists,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, people who... We always hear the
situation, wow, it was a closed loop,
[SPEAKER_03]: but why did it blow up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they never replaced their gaskets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is literally comparable to the
simplicity of cleaning your water with a
[SPEAKER_00]: water filtration system, and it becomes a
wonderful thing while you're replacing
[SPEAKER_00]: your filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the minute you stop, and I've talked
to Addison about this the other day,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that now you are... We're always
concentrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you all of a sudden stop removing
that filter, what you're doing is you're
[SPEAKER_00]: still concentrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: As that thing's breaking down,
I'm like, where did it go?
[SPEAKER_03]: That rendered into the oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been getting rid of your filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as it starts to break down,
it's no good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no different than maybe all the mold
is coming from not establishing proper
[SPEAKER_03]: protocols for bag cleanup immediately
after use.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably... The mold isn't even in
the grow half the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mold is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like floating around.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the last real surface is, I'm like,
if the weed was clean, if someone really
[SPEAKER_03]: thought they did their best, how could
they fuck it up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, it would be that they didn't
know how to clean their bags properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows, and everyone's learned,
but what do you do in a pinch?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you do when you're under the gun?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need to clean it with alcohol,
but throw it in the dryer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a way to... Basically addressing
this new world where individual users are
[SPEAKER_03]: becoming producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think commercial level extractions...
The bags were originally really for the
[SPEAKER_00]: personal user.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were never something that was
supposed to be set up for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can produce commercially with them,
of course, but it gets back to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, are there small little bits and
pieces that are getting caught in the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a stainless steel screen with many
hundreds of gallons, the mixers that go
[SPEAKER_00]: down into the V.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chronicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chronicle cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that you can run 25 or 50
pounds at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You figure out your thrashing versus how
much material is there versus water and
[SPEAKER_00]: ice, and you can really basically get it
down, so you're getting your extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not wasting... Consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're becoming consistent,
but I don't think that that'll be done in
[SPEAKER_00]: stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like things that can tolerate fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might kill me, but I can always torch
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fly to Jamaica with a pair of
brand new bags, and then leave them behind
[SPEAKER_00]: to someone to have some opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be careful with what you
leave behind, because there's no way that
[SPEAKER_00]: the majority of people are cleaning their
bags the way I clean my bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the majority of people
that... The thing is, people end up
[SPEAKER_03]: joining the...
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked a lot today about the gray
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: This new spirit where anyone can become
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some grower could find out he has the gift
in bubble hash because he grew the right
[SPEAKER_03]: strain, and now he becomes the dude,
and Instagram blows up, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily mean he came up in a culture
in which he's learned the rules to provide
[SPEAKER_03]: for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was good when it was all between 10 and
50 grams, but as things go up,
[SPEAKER_03]: as fatigue goes up, as you start getting
secondary employees, everything... What do
[SPEAKER_03]: you mean you didn't clean it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we got to go capping it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new... I think a lot of people have
become caught up by joining some level of
[SPEAKER_03]: production industry that's beyond the
personal and the homie.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can poison yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can poison your homie.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can punch your back, but as soon as
you could say money gets involved,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a different karma.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a different karma completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when... I talked about this a
variety of ways that we're in this gray
[SPEAKER_00]: area of removing ourselves from what I
call the prohibition-based dollar,
[SPEAKER_00]: the profit margin that exists based on
prohibition, based on, I can make money on
[SPEAKER_00]: this because if he gets caught with it,
he's doing 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's a great profit margin,
but it's a totally horrible profit to
[SPEAKER_00]: make.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea of cannabis becoming more
of a positive profit margin where,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fun recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have incredible value,
so let's charge a little bit of money for
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but what we give them in return,
the people that are paying for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is standards, is the highest quality of
standards so that they can acquire the
[SPEAKER_00]: safest, best quality medicine or
recreational preventative product that
[SPEAKER_00]: they could possibly access.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the profit margin,
in my opinion, it's a great profit margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great profit margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on you trading standards for
your profit, not Brandon doing 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I think one of the things
about trading that basically, that's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of why we get in these arguments about
medical because medical always kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: says, well, it means standards,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where recreation means pew pew and
whatever people like and is, I can get
[SPEAKER_03]: away with right now, which is a shifting
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about Ken's, what he said today,
the guy at our table, instead of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: or recreational, he said, I like to refer
to it as over the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I thought that was unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because everything, pretty much
everything that you can be sold over the
[SPEAKER_03]: counter has a guaranteed do not harm
innate within it that you can trust.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's when the guy gives you a prescription
that listen, this stuff's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't eat more than two in a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that over the counter trust means,
look, this has been, you kind of stake
[SPEAKER_03]: your karma on it as a brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I like the, I like the fact that,
you know, everyone says, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my standards and it doesn't fuck up
my chest, but depending on where your
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine is going, you have to be,
your standards have to meet where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going, not yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I can be a, I can be a man that
has a generation of smokers that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: just going to take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not burning my chest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's always a triple down bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, if you, you got to interact
with your dispensaries, you got to,
[SPEAKER_03]: where's this being used?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anybody old using this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this being used for palliative care?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, cause if so, then maybe these lipids
or whatever else in my product,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, is doing harm again, where for my
buddies, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they're young.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can choose what they want to
choose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think there's gotta be a choice
level and a jump in responsibility because
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that could be provided over the
counter, um, you can pretty much sue if it
[SPEAKER_03]: hurts you and sue big time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't have that here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're lucky if you can bring back some
weed that cuts your throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the regulations on cannabis and
they're comparing it to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, so this has like zero
LD 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the LD 50 for alcohol
is, but it can't be that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the person.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's insane that we compare it to what
I would consider one of the most,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I don't want to say dangerous,
but I guess, um, it is, it is linked to so
[SPEAKER_00]: many deaths, alcohol in so many different
ways through car accidents or through
[SPEAKER_00]: spousal abuse or through liver damage or
through, there's so many different roads
[SPEAKER_00]: that lead back to death with alcohol,
but it's incredible that we could be
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing like, Oh, well, how many
milligrams should we allow?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, a minimum, like just
whatever people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if people will buy 10,000 milligram
treats, then make people, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: why do you want to make them eat 10,000
milligrams or worse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what was that guy saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 milligrams?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just over the top, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should keep it to 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe 10, 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have a hundred in your
possession at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically it was like a hundred milligrams
would be your maximum gorge, binge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be binge consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even baby MJ, uh, in the hospital here in
Vancouver is currently taking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe a thousand milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at that and think of what he
thinks is binging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she was just prematurely born
and she has all sorts of problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: her.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a pretty heavy story that's
going on here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the, the hospital sort of took
over and they took possession of the child
[SPEAKER_00]: from, through child family services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they said that they were going to
decide that they were going to take this
[SPEAKER_00]: child off of the ventilator, which would
have been maybe a death sentence for the
[SPEAKER_00]: child saying that, oh, it's going to have
cerebral palsy and all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the young couple that, that are the
parents, they fought it, got a court
[SPEAKER_00]: injunction, uh, are giving the baby a
cannabis oil because she has seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of her problems and it's helping
alleviate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's one thing that,
like, that I really noticed about this
[SPEAKER_01]: conference is, is that, um, I think a lot
of the people that the legislatures that
[SPEAKER_01]: we were getting a chance to talk to you
really have no idea about these things
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're talking about, like setting
these limits of, Hey, a 10 milligram or a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred milligrams is all you're allowed
to be able to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have no idea about these
cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm like, how can you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like limiting research.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, that's limiting medical
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know how much it's going to take
to potentially solve spasms and someone
[SPEAKER_03]: who's been shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't tell me what we do know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that everyone down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Said over and over and over again,
that it's all about the patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't really see any patients
invited to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would have been good to have
the patient perspective and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: get that really unique, a few really
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring in some guest speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to kind of get a real, a real story
on what their actual story that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to be told what needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, I'm not getting the regulations
that have made, makes this accessible to
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone like me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not getting the quality of medicine
that my physical body needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can trust cannabis, but I cannot
trust all the in between parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bottom line is it's a benign herb
that has no LD 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on both of those sides of the coin,
one that there are people, children in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular that are extremely sick and
suffering that need much higher doses than
[SPEAKER_00]: the doses that these regulators are even
considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that on the other side of that,
that there is no LD 50 for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is no detrimental dose,
that the worst thing that you can have is
[SPEAKER_00]: just a bummer feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh, I ate too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's things that counteract.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of why we're so anal about
what is, cause the thing is it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what's on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what can get in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what can get passed through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really a defense of the plant to
find.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, there's no LD 50 for cannabis,
but there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: For what some human spray on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the unique thing about cannabis,
unlike any other substance you can name is
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis comes with its own protection
agency, which is these nucleation points
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lungs, these non-polar components
that protect the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I couldn't understand it for years
when people were smoking the thick paper
[SPEAKER_00]: with the glue on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, Steve Cubby was
smoking like ounces of weed a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, I can't be good for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he went and got his lungs tested
at some crazy place in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, they were telling him
that he had the lungs of like a young
[SPEAKER_00]: athlete and he was like 48 years old or
something at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it made me realize it was before I knew
about, you know, Jim Frere and him talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about what I just literally mentioned
about the nucleation points and the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-polar components.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really made sense to me when I learned
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made me realize, wow, that's really
an important factor for the BHO community
[SPEAKER_00]: or any community using non-polar
components to make sure that you remove
[SPEAKER_00]: your nauseous plant waxes, that your
product now no longer has a safety net to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect you from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get rid of those nauseous plant waxes
if you're going to use a non-polar
[SPEAKER_00]: component because you won't have polar
components present that are the nucleation
[SPEAKER_00]: points in your lungs that do protect us
from papers and glues and all these nasty
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are in cannabis that somehow
it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally get you because, you know,
it's not like there's a whole side of us
[SPEAKER_03]: that I clearly smoke cigarettes with it
and wouldn't live without it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder sometimes for the lifestyle I
live, I'm like, are you saying the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis protected me from the cigarettes,
the alcohol, the boozing, the toxins on
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis, the fucking shit it was
handed to me with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, you know, for the amount of
things I rely on today that should have
[SPEAKER_03]: fallen apart from my current lifestyle,
which is working to death in all these new
[SPEAKER_03]: realms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have died even now without
cannabis and probably back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So never take my paranoia for the baby who
clearly can't take coughing up a lung.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now for the fact that yes,
cannabis does protect us against the
[SPEAKER_03]: shitty things we've done to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in pushing medicine, because what if
there is that 10,000 milligram dose,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can't let those contaminants also move
with the current trends to then ruin
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to find out this rule
does leave permanent harm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get it out of there before we
ever get to a job big enough that we
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate too much of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hurt a kid or kill a kid because she
convulsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still should run out of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pause it on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible dialogue is always great to sit
down with these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys are going to see more of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the first little part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get down to our next round
table event in 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably a few off camera dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we'll see you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, back here at Brendan Dab's hotel
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just about to go down and watch
Horatio speak on the stage down there on
[SPEAKER_00]: the rooftop terrace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just showed up with some Terp
champagne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's okay, Alison.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the picture too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kick your cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't even know we're having Terp
champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: For breakfast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I actually brought some and I just
based on my van.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask you how is this going to make me
feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: What should I expect?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, none of us are smoking, so it
shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it might modulate some.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were doing some rosin dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only had this one time, but it was
really lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serious carbonation Terp juice right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the way the bubbles stack?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important how the bubbles stack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we'll just have to glird this and
get out of here.
Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: well here's a toast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have baby Terps?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, look at that guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good thanks Horatio and the Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the beautiful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tastes really lovely and light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very carbonated and very delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great way to start it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's better than morning coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw some sweet scone Terps in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one was Kimo Kush with a little bit
of My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always loved My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to head down and watch Horatio
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't film any of it, but we'll come
and have a session later and talk to you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
See you guys later.
