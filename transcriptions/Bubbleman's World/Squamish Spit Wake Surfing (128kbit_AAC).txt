[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here on the world-famous Spit,
found in Squamish, BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the Chief is right behind me,
as well as Shannon Falls, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful waterfalls that I visited on
Bubble Man's World with D420K,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as Dries Maestro and Brett Wilson
from the West Coast Concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very windy right now, I'm trying to
get the best quality as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just came down to blow a couple of bowls
here on the Spit, watch a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: windsurfers, kite surfers, and you know,
I'm right next to the hot tub here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How cool is that?
Put that a hot tub on the Spit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you if it was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out some of the kite boarders,
kite surfers, and yeah, maybe we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to them, maybe we'll film them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely we're going to be doing a
couple of bowls here, as it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday after Puff Wednesday,
and I think puffing is still in order,
[SPEAKER_00]: so let's go check them out, shall we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I just came back to the
truck here for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am still on the Spit.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that are wondering,
you can see the kite surfers rocking it
[SPEAKER_00]: out there, which is, oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he just bail?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he did not bail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that was a accurate turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, this is my first time out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really fucking cool environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty stoked to be around all these
people getting into the sport activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I'm not one to smoke a bowl and
then sit around and do nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one of those guys that really likes to
get active, so I found a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice sweet skunk driving my sift
from my past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't believe it just popped up out of
nowhere, but I figure that's what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to blast here today, so I got the
torch, I got the ship, and why don't we...
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we get started?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're anything like me, you like to
clean your ceramic till it turns white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like hitting on the char in any
way, shape, or form, so we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: white this one up nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always make sure when you put your torch
down that you're careful not to put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a situation where it's going to tip over
and burn your truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, those birds are really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Floating so beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if you guys can see those ravens
that are just floating by there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're floating on the wind, barely
flying, just using the natural wind that
[SPEAKER_00]: is wicked up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably right above us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get this down so we can
actually hit a nice temp dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that know the ceramic by
Brothership or by Hive, it's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: company, I believe, that did the work for
them, but they are definitely very thick
[SPEAKER_00]: quality ceramics, but you really need to
have to heat it up good, and once you've
[SPEAKER_00]: heated it up good, it is definitely going
to take about a minute plus before it's
[SPEAKER_00]: cooled down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is extremely, extremely dry,
dry sift that I found, so I'll probably
[SPEAKER_00]: just do a dunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very big hit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery dunks on Bubble Man's World out at
the Spit in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take you back out and give
you some more footage as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be the super long video,
but always nice to see a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dunk's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpiniline, turpin, sativa, narrow leaf
indica, narrow leaf drug cultivar,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taster's choice on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we go get a couple more little
clips of the Kipe Borders, and we'll come
[SPEAKER_00]: back in and do yet another dab for our way
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll give thanks to the Mudder Ships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had the smallest amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still managed to get it to perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you then.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'm back out on the Spit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly windy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure how it's going to turn up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've turned my phone around, so the mic
isn't picking up the wind, but it can
[SPEAKER_00]: still be picking up the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give you an idea of where I am,
I'm out on this peninsula of land in
[SPEAKER_00]: Squamish, B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually been across the way there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shannon Falls is just on the right of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a couple of dudes out there
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting some hangings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the real deal for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's ripping in right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's coming in pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like we got blown out by the wind,
the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up is... What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Pokemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole time I was filming, I was like,
oh, these guys probably think I'm playing
[SPEAKER_00]: that fucking game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some of the coolness of the people
that you meet around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally don't know that dude, but he's one
of the dudes that's working here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's about to take his board out and go
for a rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting times here on the Spit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Squamish and you want to
check out something fun to do in B.C.,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are like, oh,
it's raining.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, if you're a pussy,
there's nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get outside, rock it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful outside, even in a little
bit of the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm probably going to stick around for
a little bit, minus the electronics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and go enjoy a little bit of the rain out
on the Spit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll see you guys later on Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Man, set up the machine.
