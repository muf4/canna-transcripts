[SPEAKER_01]: We're going closing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome everyone to Bubble Man's
World and welcome to Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gate just closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the gate, well it just opened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a secure area here, Johnny B and
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are at the marina and we're going to be
heading down to the little tiny dock.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought our little chairs and we
brought the drone and we brought the
[SPEAKER_01]: D-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually the courts with the mothership,
not the D-nail story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought we'd bring you guys with us
on this beautiful Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit rainy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that bad, but we're good with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very little dock here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much dock at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very private dock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's small.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to set up our chairs
here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wait, let's go on that side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's more room without the
sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can go, I can set the camera up
right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is the one when you lean back on
your chair, you go for a swim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is definitely, this is some,
what's the best way to say it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like that Johnny?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let me get this camera set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to lie, I felt a little bit like
I was going over the edge there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you feel that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well you, you're kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I had to sit back here,
but I was looking at that epic behind us
[SPEAKER_04]: guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see how the clouds just coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, we just got this break.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd started out having a few dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually there's a gas station on this
dock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily that's been put away for the
winter so we can have a couple of little
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice that the dock is moving so
there'll be motion in the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're on a boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B's filling her up with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get her up nice and high there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought the quartz XL.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that for a big boy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
Hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty excited about this.
Actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got, Oh, we had rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm noticing it's not in here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dab that rosin into these Terps and
have a couple of, have a couple of rips
[SPEAKER_01]: here while we're, while we're on the dock
and talk about all things puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: When's the last time we did a puff
Wednesday near the ocean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weren't we on a boat?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it on a boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although no, that might've been the bubble
hash episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, we haven't done a ton of
things near the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we were trying to desperately to
figure out if we should jump on the float
[SPEAKER_01]: plane, but it's quite overcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still wanted to share a day with you
guys and enjoy some comedy because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: comedy every time we get together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would it be to start this with a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pull out a nice Terp for us to dip
into the dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that crown Royals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feeling pretty healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: White cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've been dabbing hard when
all of your Terps have gone yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also dipping into those.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of dipping, a lot of dipping,
a lot of dipping.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a little kush cleaner on that
rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we couldn't, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And this, this rosin here, this guy's,
this is a can of tonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen how nice the flowing water
probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the sound right now is that
background that you guys are hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: John and I probably aren't realizing how
loud it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to just hit a couple of dab
each real quick, and then we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: walk you guys over to a really sweet beach
that is not too far from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go sit on the beach,
have some more dabs over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one of those places that it's
been untouched because it is fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just looked at it and the sand was
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no footprints on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was basically like an untouched beach
from the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like one of those spots where you
look and you're like, oh, fresh.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like hitting some fresh dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Off an XL quartz bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the size of that thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and here's the carved cap guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what it says?
[SPEAKER_04]: It says bubble man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's, I kind of want to get up,
but I'll then probably trip, then I'll end
[SPEAKER_04]: up in the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys will laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be wet, it'll be cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it for Puff Wednesday, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the best one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we did that ICBC conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I loved the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: ICBC conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed that conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the international cannabis business
conference put on by Alex Rogers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does it in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does it in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does it in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he really organized a pretty,
pretty cool event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not what I would call an expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: There weren't a lot of people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tickets were extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly due to the fact that, you know,
it was a business conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: This conference is for people to go and do
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be like 30 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to, you know,
go by my hand right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super duper hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nice thing about the XL is that it
takes a while to heat up and it has more
[SPEAKER_01]: surface area to expand that heat into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't get these tiny, tiny little
bluffs of, of extreme heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we're going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to dab this here in a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're not running the tab.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were going by feel and we're pretty
much good at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm better with quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to admit I'm brutal with that
ceramic guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hit this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the best part about that ICBC
conference really the international
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis business conference and how was
held up was all the talkers and speakers
[SPEAKER_04]: that came, which I know Mark has got tons
of video coverage of a lot of all these
[SPEAKER_04]: speakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent, excellent talks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even on the acidic acid parts of the
compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really, really interesting to see
how everybody came together and it was,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was education and, and, and really
business to business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's knowing what to do and when to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: See that he's like, here, I need this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a perfect temperature on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no burn at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all very low temp dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still going to make sure we clean
this up real good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to keep that quartz bowl
nice, you want to keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you don't have a Q-tip and you
really want to dab, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to break in your bowl over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you know, I've, I've hung out with
people that take care of their quartz and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hung out with people that don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I feel better about taking
care of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks so nice when it looks,
this is a year and a half old,
[SPEAKER_01]: this XL I've hit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A year and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping that thing looking new.
[SPEAKER_01]: O-C-D.
[SPEAKER_01]: O-C-D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not always like that, but with this
particular unit I have been, and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: traveled to Amsterdam, to Spain,
to Jamaica, to Toronto, to quite a few
[SPEAKER_01]: different areas with this particular XL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to DC Glass out in Ontario for
hooking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of his, so yeah, very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me hit you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get you a turp dip first.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dipping.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, here, I can dab,
he gets that ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give him the Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the things that we love about
cannabis and cannabis use is that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very much a flow of sharing and of keeping
it moving through, throughout the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never really a, well, everyone knows
what it feels like to Bogart something and
[SPEAKER_01]: people generally are like, they feel it
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people start Bogarting money and then
people around them start feeling that
[SPEAKER_01]: because the money's no longer flowing,
obviously the good thing to do is it's
[SPEAKER_01]: okay to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you keep it flowing when you do
because that way it gets around to
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone that needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like puffing and passing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dipped you, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got dipped.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the best thing about it though,
but when you're dealing with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I always say, whenever I do that dab
or let up a joint, you look for someone to
[SPEAKER_04]: share it with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that community that draws us so
close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I love about Puff
Wednesdays because believe it or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: while you guys are watching this,
we're thinking of you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know all of you, but we've met
some of you over the years at the events
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think like, there's people
puffing with us right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That camera is a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just at the Calgary Hemp Fest and
hands down in Calgary and people came up
[SPEAKER_04]: there, Puff Wednesday!
[SPEAKER_04]: And they do us some hash charts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a shout out to you guys out there that
watch, the good viewers, guys in Calgary
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the respect and coming up
and just saying, hey, it's nice to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: be a part of what you guys are a part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to have something as an
icebreaker to be able to meet someone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I felt the same way going and
seeing Paul Stamets the other day doing
[SPEAKER_01]: his speak on the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I got to go over and just
shake his hand and tell him you're a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: inspiration and do the same thing that I
get people doing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see them doing it to you and other
people in our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just more of that flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the passing on of the energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sharing of the energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you would never came up and
said that to me, I might want to do this
[SPEAKER_04]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you guys that come up and say,
hey, and thank us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason why we keep doing this
is because of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to share these beautiful
environments with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we don't have the wide angle lens,
so you're not getting as much of the view.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we go to the beach,
after Johnny hits this dab, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get on the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pan it across the water so
you can get a real nice, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: have a couple of puffs on your dupe or
have a dab while it kind of pans over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just going to change right
into the beach shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited like that little expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Johnny B and I have been discussing
potential opportunities for Puff
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a Puff Wednesday,
and particularly that you want to see
[SPEAKER_01]: done, I have a couple of ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe us going around to a variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going around to a variety of dispensaries
and testing some of the higher quality
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could go up to Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do the float plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could go to the Sunshine Coast and
visit the Flap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a helicopter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to do all these things,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to take a helicopter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect you're going to get a pretty
nice low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with dabbing outside when it's
much cooler as well is that I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_01]: where that little unit went.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can dab with that if you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I put it in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled a faux pas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hooked you up with the Slinger jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a Slinger marble as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give a shout out to Marble
Slinger.
[SPEAKER_01]: If for some reason you've been living
under a rock and you don't know who
[SPEAKER_01]: Slinger is, he is responsible for the
Degenerate Art documentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But much more than that, he was,
you know, he is a really good friend and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was lucky enough to meet him in the 90s
while he was learning how to blow glass
[SPEAKER_01]: and was able to be lucky enough for him to
move up into my neighborhood and live very
[SPEAKER_01]: close to me while blowing glass and sell
glass at my gallery and throw the original
[SPEAKER_01]: Degenerate Art glass show together with
him that would become later on the
[SPEAKER_01]: inspiration for his documentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Slinger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find him on Facebook under Michael
J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slinger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find him on Instagram as Slinger01
or Slinger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find him if you just do the Slinger
Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, of course, it's nice to give a
guy a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from like 2003 and this is
probably from like 2000 and maybe one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right away when I was looking for that,
I had already known that I was using this
[SPEAKER_04]: for the carpet.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you were looking for it, I'm like,
no, just give me the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even as I looked down, I thought it's
in my pocket, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like that lighter that you
always think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we are going to head over to the
beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to give you a little pan out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you when we get over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are
[SPEAKER_01]: you, blue or green?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going green.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue for Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got here to the beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fully private.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nobody here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Private beach?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Private beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, this is sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you guys thought of that
drone footage, but man, I was so stoked
[SPEAKER_01]: how that turned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shot of it leaving the dock.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try and get another shot
for you here, but it is raining quite bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were thinking of doing a sesh here
because it's so, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a perfect spot, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we just get one dab in and maybe go
head over to the boat?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a boat to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got this giant houseboat over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can't really see it, but we could
go check that out really quickly and
[SPEAKER_01]: briefly, or we could have a session here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't just get here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about we sesh here with these guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we sesh over there because if it gets
too wet, if I have to put on my hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super bad right now, but I'm
definitely starting to see the water
[SPEAKER_01]: gather on my pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the cleanliness of this beach
though, the way everything's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your water bottle?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where'd that saying come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone's going to write it in the comment
section.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I had to resee it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wiki.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it came from like, um,
Point Grey.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Booyah from Point Grey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water flip.
[SPEAKER_04]: See that?
[SPEAKER_04]: See the catch?
[SPEAKER_04]: See the catch?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been putting a lot of practice into
our water flipping lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: John and I have been spending hours trying
to get it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a whole video on water flipping
coming out, joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: See that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny's a natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been practicing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no denying his talent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, stop raining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kinda.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of felt like it picked up even
harder at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just love Beautiful BC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he does too.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: I moved here, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, I did too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually from... No, but I mean like
on my own as an, as a, as an adult
[SPEAKER_01]: deciding I'm not going to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I live anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was not going to live there.
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents didn't come.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents didn't come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish they would have, but yeah,
I did make a decision and that decision
[SPEAKER_01]: was to move away from the prairies and
move to the West coast because it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: so friggin beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you dip that in some turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get the torch first.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I need to do is hold onto this for
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll need it back right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to then hand it back to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, this is what we call the joint
effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without the joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one, but you don't want one.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't smoke that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will then take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will then light you up here on the
XL torch banger and, and, and yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny little bit of a stain on the side
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a very light one that the torch will,
uh, will remove for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will have to admit I was trying to
clean, but my eyes have gotten so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are getting blurry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can see, but the thing
that was left over is now completely gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please don't feel in any way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get rid of most of it, you'll be
able to clean it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you leave large amounts of it and
you heat it up too hot, then you just end
[SPEAKER_01]: up oxidizing your quartz nail and it's not
quite as white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite as wonderful as it was when
it was new, like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like the one that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just telling you it is because we
actually hit on the lap puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was saying how I was the guy who let
someone use it and wasn't paying attention
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope you guys can hear us because
we are definitely not close to the camera
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is my new camera and I'm suspecting
that it's a, it's kicking butt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking it's up to par.
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably think why are they
screaming?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are those guys always screaming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping my hand over it so it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this can be you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this me?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the last one was a little too
light though because I did cool a little
[SPEAKER_04]: too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I was giving you the low temp,
but if you want to go further,
[SPEAKER_01]: the thing with the low temp is it's easier
to clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you burn it, then you basically that's
where the oxidization happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I burn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a hot, heavy guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny Beale hit the D nail cleaning
itself and not even be bummed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's stripped off.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take that from you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a fine rip there, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fine rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll come in right behind you and
clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to admit that last one I got
wasn't that good, but that one,
[SPEAKER_04]: thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one was a tasty ripper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me it's, I like the thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, thumbs up is fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the thumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very, what was the flavor of that
one in particular?
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was mojito.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mojito.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love mojito.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love mojito is actually how I experienced
a lot of things with my pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we talk about this like with the,
with the one there, that purple punch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That mojito.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flavor with that kind of tonic wasn't
what Rosalyn was at.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a Girl Scout cookies,
Rosalyn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right there was the Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what's the, there's something
there that's giving me a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to follow your footsteps
and I'm going to give myself a little Girl
[SPEAKER_01]: Scout cookies as I'm trying to get it off
the parchment and it's shattering and
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting me in the eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hit me in the eye?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it could be a little dangerous once
you're Rosalyn gets a little shattering.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to wear glasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Safety glasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about safety here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think I got hit by some Rosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the, here's the bit I was looking
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as he's talking down, I'm talking,
that was the bit he was looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got to exactly what he needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Booyak.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started the booyak today.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, see what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're dipping there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some fine sour diesel from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hit mojito and the mojito was
definitely, it's the turkeys that really
[SPEAKER_04]: make it, make it the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably can't hear a word I'm saying
because of the torch and the ocean behind
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, look at this area.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a little bit of mother nature
with the seagull flying in behind us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some ducks here over here on the
left, probably still.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that dab actually did me in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what to talk to these
guys about right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to keep it fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's coming up next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Carbon Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say a bong room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Karma Cup is in four days and I'm actually
very looking forward to this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah's put a ton of energy into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like she's got some good people
behind her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do my part and go hang out
and get my little booth and do the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're going to be there as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have a booth this time just
because of the way life is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can hang out at my booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm definitely going to be hanging out
with this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what booth number I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's 187, but you can look on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I speak a couple of times as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on a panel speaking about craft
cannabis, which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't always speak about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually speak about extractions,
but I've definitely no stranger to craft
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and high-end small growth,
you know, smaller growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I do my own as well, where it's
just me speaking and I don't know exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm going to talk about, but I think
I'm going to try and talk about a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of water hash, a little bit of dry
sift, the difference between oil and hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways of hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpene extraction, the modulating,
just sort of everything that we've really
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing on hash churches that I've been
sort of building with Tony and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what the talk will be
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he just talked about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look forward to that talk at the Carmel
Club.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never plan it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: See?
[SPEAKER_01]: He already said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go hit a bowl in that boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got this beautiful boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sitting up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a giant house boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a slide on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you can hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a couch on the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they can hear me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is still hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's actually hitting the back of the
course with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then it drips into the large bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a really good way of what he was
talking about when I first did my hit too,
[SPEAKER_04]: is being able to actually hold it to the
back so it drips into the bowl and then
[SPEAKER_04]: goes across that surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a great way of getting a really,
really good hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just watching it drip and go up like that,
that sounds pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of, you know what, it was a good
way of explaining that because how you
[SPEAKER_04]: showed me is to put it to the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was kind of explaining what he said
to me to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the fuck this guy's
babbling on about, but I am loving this
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a clean one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just hitting this bowl and getting
lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was telling him, and I was telling
him explaining how you put the tool
[SPEAKER_04]: against the back of the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: That taste was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the sour diesel from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Waves are coming in beautiful rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rain is starting to simmer down a little
bit, but I still want to take you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: over to the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this big, beautiful houseboat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we go sit on that for a little
bit and we'll get a little bit of a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: view and we'll get off the beach here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's my buddy's houseboat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to go check it on out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave us permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got the couch right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cushions are off of it though,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not quite as comfortable as one
might think.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the view off the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have made it onto the vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it started from a dock.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went around to a beach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm on a boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're on a boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's like the ocean thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ocean puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could I offer you a bong rip terp dip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me light you up, my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is quite nice about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a beautiful time of year to be
able to take you to the ocean when it's
[SPEAKER_04]: calm, but you have to start with the boat
ready to break.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget, we just had this major
hurricane that almost hit the Pacific
[SPEAKER_04]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It shut down all the boats here and stuff
like that the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's calm here right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're sitting on a boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nights we were like floating.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen us floating on a boat before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pulling bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to do that again one
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: We pulled bags on rivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We pulled bags on oceans.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't pulled bags on lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled bags on lakes, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not on a puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should do it in an ice cave.
[SPEAKER_04]: You talked about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One day we're going to make the ice cave.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I never thought I'd ever be able to
make it to an ice cave.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got a good 40 seconds on that
before I hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: The exhale would be so delicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably wouldn't even know it was an
exhale because that would all be absorbed
[SPEAKER_04]: into me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the most important part was that that
carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I just put down there for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still a little bit a ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd give it another 15 to 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably won't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably give it to that says 40.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because now it's actually like 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try getting that all in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely need a Q-tip though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you one right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm jumping in here into the captain's
seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty excited about it actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just looked out the window and there's a
big seagull.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually raining pretty good out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sweet that we're in here right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to my buddy Eric for letting us
sit in his boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very kind of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were being absolutely respectful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do appreciate you allowing us to
have this little position here to set up
[SPEAKER_01]: with and share it with our viewers.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I love that because when I was at the
Calgary Hem Fest, I went nowhere and
[SPEAKER_04]: talked to the guy who was running it,
Sasha.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I let him realize that when he watched
the past church that he will see that I
[SPEAKER_04]: was puffing indoors and getting people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was popping people down in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had warned him that this already had
happened and to let him know that it was
[SPEAKER_04]: good for his event.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He smiled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he was already happy about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we can't all make everyone happy all
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best part about it was the people that
came up and showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love getting the nail as clean as
possible before taking my dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a way to get a cleanest dab,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you want to maintain that,
keep that oxidization away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how clear that hole is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job on the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been well taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, got the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't shown this to you guys yet,
so we might as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: How sweet is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Screenshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Screenshots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was me in the background all
blurry and then it just said bubble man
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'll just go by my hand with
the quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot more confidence in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep looking away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really pulling my eye out this
window right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a beautiful kind of rainy,
semi rainy day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten a little bit of rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten a little bit of just not rain
and cloudy with a little breaks of sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a rainbow out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what we'll have to do for Puff
Wednesdays one time is go to Tofino for
[SPEAKER_01]: the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like fly over early at like six in the
morning and film the whole thing and film
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole day and eat a great meal and
then fly back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tofino is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can take you to five different beaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about the Puff Wednesdays that
we're going to come to in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we just made a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a Tofino.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many a Puff Wednesday ideas,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should do it during the storm season so
you get to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're in right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the storm season.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I mentioned Tofino.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll absolutely do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely a low temp.
[SPEAKER_04]: But definitely a tasty and amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were like hitting a volcano,
that would be probably on like around like
[SPEAKER_04]: a level five or level six.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely a really terpy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could be a really terpy, terpy head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then watch how when you're dabbing and
how it's pulling up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then dropping down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like John said, we've done some dock
dabs, beach dabs, boat dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a little bit of drone footage for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think you guys are going to enjoy
this Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sun is breaking through up here right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just come.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should take a bath now.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the sun coming through?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in full agreeance with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go check out the back of the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm filming it all right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're right where they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to the back?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to bring the dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is raining.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun's breaking through.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, there's a slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Johnny V.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show them what we do on Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see you slide right onto those
rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would definitely have to go get some
more surgery after that stupid attempt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing is definitely not positioned
safely for slide use.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is not a slide use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, it's a wood slide too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he built his own slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't expecting that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, I was like a kid in the
candy store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, check that shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should grab the chairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we should set up right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should take a look up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also got another higher version of a
deck right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could also go kind of chill out up
here with our seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: See the sun is breaking through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, oh, I need sunglasses now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll pass you the dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also pass you a torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm going to put all this stuff
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this nice little natural table that
is the slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've made it to the top floor of the
houseboat ocean behind us, Boyer Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you said it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cool in there, but this is way
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all of a sudden the Sun came up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stopped raining.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like clear the water is It's like you
will definitely see 20 feet down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see into it Anyway, we're gonna
finish it off with some some beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs here on the top of the houseboat I
guess I should pull out some rosin Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that what you want to hit?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're both gonna dip into
cherry ak-47 cherry ak-47 for the win I
[SPEAKER_01]: Mean, what are you different at the end of
your problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what do you like to dip in when it's
your last puff of the puff Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know John and bubble man can always
kind of trip you out And pull another
[SPEAKER_01]: session out of their hat even when you
thought it was the end, but let's say this
[SPEAKER_01]: is the end What are you puffing on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one are you gonna go for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it rosin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it bubble?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it some other form of oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a joint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a bowl?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you turf-dipping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you bong-ripping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you fuck-yan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you double-dipping?
[SPEAKER_04]: Triple-dipping?

[SPEAKER_01]: mistake for also islands because they
can't tell that those islands are attached
[SPEAKER_01]: to the mainland So the problem isn't with
the Sunshine Coast is you can't drive to
[SPEAKER_01]: it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about it I saw an article
in the paper the other day where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: opening discussion in all of our
neighborhoods To see if we want them to
[SPEAKER_01]: build a road from here to the Sunshine
Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's definitely something they're
thinking about and I think they know they
[SPEAKER_01]: can do it I think it's just a matter of
will the community want it and will they
[SPEAKER_01]: let it happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some will be happy and some won't
because anyone that lives on the Sunshine
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast a lot of people move over there
because it's much more affordable to live
[SPEAKER_01]: in a beautiful area because of the that
fairy distance and how you can't go in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of the night and how you're stuck
on the island without a boat and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's that aspect it makes the property
much more attainable to purchase and now
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to have a road that goes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could extend this area into that area
and raise the prices would go up So some
[SPEAKER_04]: people good investment right now would be
to buy on the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah And some people are gonna be happy
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the community members that didn't
buy their house to for profit They're
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely gonna be like, you know,
this is kind of a bummer Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what it was access access to more
beautiful property more beautiful land for
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like that It's really nice to be able
to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we share you this with you guys
Off Wednesday I enjoy a good Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's nice to watch those waves come in
It's nice to feel this really light rain
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because you know a lot of
people they think it's raining out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They assume the worst They don't want to
go out in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to be caught up in it
today John and I we just trucked right
[SPEAKER_01]: into it with elect with equipment and
drones and pushed through and I'm feeling
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty good about it Yeah, it's just blue

[SPEAKER_04]: it happen guys, and that's what you have
to do only if you have to make it happen

part about we show you here today.

ante in the near future get out to Tofino.

couple of puff Wednesdays filmed and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe film two or three puff Wednesdays

[SPEAKER_04]: there just for one day You're definitely
getting a two or three part series out of
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying Yeah, that's what
we're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it's gonna be like a four-hour
puff Wednesday, and I don't think anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: wants That I think well, they would be
like, you know, how many people want just
[SPEAKER_04]: said hell yeah, and then I'm here like
really Yeah, so like you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely don't want that We
definitely don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh here take this That's you I can time it
for you if you like or I could just use my
[SPEAKER_01]: hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it Here the timer's on Probably
about 45 seconds and you also got no dip
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't mind I think you guys even
they were screaming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're gonna miss Johnny's dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta get dipping Lately everybody's
been calling me JV And my mom I'll thank
[SPEAKER_02]: my mom for that she comments on everything
that's my JV JV J mean all my comments So
[SPEAKER_01]: even you're picking up on it All right,
so you're about 10 seconds out And we got
[SPEAKER_00]: you the debt be out there All right,
I Will get q-tip and on that bad boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, see that's what's so nice here
under
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't I'm trying to get your burnt head
off the bowl No, no, not too bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: but definitely like a little bit like
harder than usually to get off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey, I'll torch it in that hot I
Scraped most of it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a little nice little edge of
darkness that the q-tip was unable to So
[SPEAKER_04]: that would really be enough harder hits A
little bit hotter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's what you leave that black
and so we just learned something right
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've known that for Almost like I
shouldn't waste this nice hot hole that I
[SPEAKER_04]: made I like it and he's doing one more
down as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's kind of like Getting it all
ready for nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be getting it all ready for
nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: So just do a repeat of that same old thing
and repeat Let it cool down even longer
[SPEAKER_01]: lot than last time because I want to get
less of a I want to get a real puddle hit
[SPEAKER_01]: quite accurate with my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say the puddle hit Yeah,
I like when it puddles like when it's I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna just kind of drips in low temp
Something be said for it and for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still the guy that likes a really nice
Good hit there's something to be said for
[SPEAKER_04]: that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it works Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no doubt about this you get way
more rocked off of one of those hard hot
[SPEAKER_01]: hits Compared to a super nice low temp
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe people out there are Disagreeing
what I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a total for sure But that's the
way that goes and what I'm looking and
[SPEAKER_04]: explaining is is Some people are diving
hotter because it helps them really late
[SPEAKER_04]: this so the temperatures also contribute
to what works for you So see that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: minute and I'm still not hitting this
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: See he's on the minute 15 seconds an XL
banger It's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember a few guys saying that a
minute 30 minute 25 and I think he's
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty much on par with the hand I'm
feeling that right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's feeling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, when you're going five right now,
and he's hitting the 125 And
[SPEAKER_04]: of course getting right in there with the
carb cap wouldn't you do that to help Of
[SPEAKER_01]: course you would that was perfect Well
