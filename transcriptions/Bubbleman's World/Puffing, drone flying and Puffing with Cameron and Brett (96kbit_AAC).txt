[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world We
are sitting here in beautiful British
[SPEAKER_11]: Columbia on my deck actually with Brett
from West Coast concentrate in the house
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've got trees maestro here from
online.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I met you originally in Jamaica
But before we were doing periscopes and
[SPEAKER_11]: seeing each other through social media
platforms And we totally hit it off He was
[SPEAKER_11]: one of our big helpers along with Ross and
Austin in Jamaica for the cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_11]: there Tony and I definitely couldn't have
survived without the help that Cameron and
[SPEAKER_11]: Ross and Austin gave us so it was it's
great to have you in BC, dude Oh,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's great to be here first time out here
so And with your beautiful glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was pretty surprised I knew you were
coming up to get a heady piece from the
[SPEAKER_11]: boys I had no idea that you were bringing
also heady pieces So maybe you want to
[SPEAKER_11]: give us a quick little rundown on the two
pieces That you brought here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this first one here is the Technicolor
dream cycler made by Corey glass That's
[SPEAKER_08]: Corey Cottenham Corey glass on Instagram
Patrick stratus at stratosphere glass on
[SPEAKER_08]: Instagram and niche and that's niche glass
on Instagram also This was made from about
[SPEAKER_08]: a year ago Just the the classic double
Klein recycler and then on the other side
[SPEAKER_08]: of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got one of the first stratosphere
tricycler prototypes not quite sure if
[SPEAKER_08]: that's the first one made but We have an
inkling that it might be With the big old
[SPEAKER_08]: puking beagle the big old 30 millimeter
puking beagle banger the skillet banger
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that is the glob stopper as things
totally ridiculous So we were thinking
[SPEAKER_11]: today we were gonna do a little bit of
bowls out here on the deck and we also
[SPEAKER_11]: thought Maybe we'd get the drone out give
you guys a little bit of the footage from
[SPEAKER_11]: my deck off the drone and then take it up
north to Shannon Falls this epic waterfall
[SPEAKER_11]: that is always beautiful and cool in a hot
day like Today to just go have a session.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we've got all sorts of West Coast
concentrate resins along with some
[SPEAKER_11]: concentrated X here that we're gonna be
hitting throughout the day thanks to West
[SPEAKER_11]: Coast concentrate and to concentrated X
for For making such nice products here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got some beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got that green crack God I got the PK 90
first 90 for me guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I ever got I went and had breakfast with
Adam the other day and he was like I
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't think you guys had a 90 bag They're
coming dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's start with the PK 90 for that very
reason Yeah, we understand that those
[SPEAKER_03]: heads are a little bit more desirable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started running them and it's
phenomenal Photograph this but after we
[SPEAKER_11]: hit it because this is not one of those
situations where we're not gonna be
[SPEAKER_11]: hitting it first Exactly get it on the
next it's actually quite just in the
[SPEAKER_11]: middle of greasing up now From being
beautiful and powdery.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you want to start us off Brett?
[SPEAKER_11]: I can do that Get that out of your way
Yeah Nice move with the slide.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought he was gonna pick it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was really definitely impressed with the
slide Give that a little twist off the top
[SPEAKER_11]: there boom Right here This piece hits
really deep when I dry hit it it was just
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't realize it but the two tubes on
either side or the recycler chambers where
[SPEAKER_11]: the waters Filtering through it's pretty
damn cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: It definitely delivers a pretty heavy hit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet deep right?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely one of those pieces that
you can feel I haven't even actually hit
[SPEAKER_11]: it ever Dry hit it now twice a year ago
when Stratus brought it to the hotel and I
[SPEAKER_11]: photographed it in Vancouver I have
beautiful pictures of this pipe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll pass your way because
[SPEAKER_11]: You're sticking dirty shit in there If you
noticed I scraped it and managed to get it
[SPEAKER_11]: off and I'm really digging and creating a
I dug a little bit, but it's alright The
[SPEAKER_11]: hash master diligence here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm learning the photography.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nothing else.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the anal photographer It makes no
sense in any other way that people out in
[SPEAKER_11]: the world would be like, oh, yeah bubble
man says you should scrape.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, it's totally Only for photos.
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, I do exactly All right,
I feel kind of bad that it's like you're
[SPEAKER_11]: last in this tour, but hey, I've enjoyed
it a lot already But not the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess you have enjoyed the West
Coast as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Yeah melt on that what would you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Notes definitely on point taste is
definitely true to a PK Which is always
[SPEAKER_03]: which is always something to when you run
a straight through water you're just
[SPEAKER_03]: hoping that it carries through its,
you know same taste What do you think?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's tasty as fuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, beautiful Always those strains that
have alcohol soluble terpenes that
[SPEAKER_11]: transfer through in the water process They
don't reach out into the water.
[SPEAKER_11]: They stay true all the way to the end
product and it's just It's a wonderful
[SPEAKER_11]: thing when that happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a wonderful thing That thank you very
much Yeah, probably shouldn't have left
[SPEAKER_11]: that little guy out my son no man is it's
soft Today it's gotta be 18 degrees.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at that little bit of bubble.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh Yeah, that's there for a while So it's
everybody in YouTube land Buffin bowls on
[SPEAKER_03]: the B man's deck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the first time you've tried a 90
from us as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, good And what a great place to be
hidden
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really looking forward to heading up
to Shannon Falls and seeing if we can't
[SPEAKER_11]: pull off a really beautiful drone Climb up
the waterfall to share with the audience.
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, we're gonna go have a
session up there too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really cool They're shaded areas
because the mountain so high where the
[SPEAKER_11]: waterfall comes off of and it's a lot of
big rocks and you get a mist you get
[SPEAKER_11]: actually quite a mist from the water when
it's really pumping which I suspect it is
[SPEAKER_11]: as we got so much rain and Have you been
out there before?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, you've done a video with D up
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I took D up there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah I've been going up there for
years.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I haven't done many videos other than
just the one with with D 420 K But and
[SPEAKER_11]: that's on our sizzler as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is yeah That's where I seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely excited to go up and take
it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh It's down with the good waterfall on a
nice day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're gonna go green crack God 120
that that 90 pk superb bread Cheers to you
[SPEAKER_11]: and the team color on that one Phil Phil
Full melt certified by the bubble man and
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say the last one was definitely a
six-star.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Grown by Phil some of it was
extracted by Phil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it was extracted by us Nowadays
who knows with the team's just working as
[SPEAKER_03]: hard as they can to get as much team six
star out there Get it out there to the
[SPEAKER_03]: people man.
[SPEAKER_03]: See see how we can come Yeah, you can move
that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the GCG in general seems to be a lot
more stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, sir You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to switch do you want me to
hit this?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know what we hit this one round
So why don't we go do the fab bag for it?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we'll we'll do some torch rips on
the on the skillet green crack God Super
[SPEAKER_11]: stable wicked wicked wicked color on this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have to go through some pictures and
find Find them to add to the video because
[SPEAKER_11]: of course everyone always loves those
macro photos so they can kind of see what
[SPEAKER_08]: we're seeing Oh, absolutely like you say
it's it really is God's Word Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's almost seeing what you're
trying to describe in taste and flavor and
[SPEAKER_03]: in star rating right, you know Thank you
It really is a way to unveil there isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no getting small dabs of this
there's just big that's what I was trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to tell you That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just kind of comes out of the jar
because we're sitting in hot weather just
[SPEAKER_03]: comes out as clumps Versus and it looks
nice and and granular and sandy but as
[SPEAKER_03]: soon as you put a dabber into it Whatever
is touching that dabber comes out with it
[SPEAKER_03]: and whatever is touching that comes out
with it as well Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is that due to just seeing the trichome
head?
[SPEAKER_11]: Man that is so tasty that 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, really nice Yeah, the GCG is
something that we get to run enough of and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it's always a pleasure It's always
like damn look how white that is when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes out of the bag Definitely not never
mad at running the 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get Cameron on point for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy, too I'm noticing just the
color difference in that 90 to a 73 a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more these days
[SPEAKER_03]: You pick whatever we're gonna hold we
should do this actually, no, it's He
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to try the Strawberry oh
Concentrated concentrated.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always like trying that Yeah came out
like that
[SPEAKER_11]: Supernature and beautiful and although I
know people are like, oh your your deck is
[SPEAKER_11]: beautiful in nature It's just it's still
nice to get out our home into other zones
[SPEAKER_11]: and this waterfall is Definitely one of
the most impressive waterfalls.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow Incredible you guys heavy,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the GCG is definitely heavy and
turps and heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: Too big one bigger than I would normally
have taken because and you took one right
[SPEAKER_11]: before because we mucked it up and had to
edit it out We didn't even have to tell
[SPEAKER_11]: anybody that I did and I might even edit
that out All right, are we doing this?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I guess we're gonna hit this last
piece here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got the torch We can kind of maybe get
this guy more out of the place And yeah,
[SPEAKER_11]: we got this Just good to keep separately
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how do you like it?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's your carb cap, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Have that accessible and then oh,
yeah, we were gonna hit Well, this will be
[SPEAKER_11]: the ultimate test really to skill it out
the strawberry banana Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you want to torch it for me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know the banger I'm not too
good with banger temps just because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: super on the email and you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna have to apologize to I usually
use that little tiny baby torch So we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My lungs will be the guinea pig.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right lighter the better usually
[SPEAKER_08]: Torches that's why we have the D nails.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah It's definitely why we have the D
nails and once you get torching outside in
[SPEAKER_03]: the bright sun with the wind up A little
bit blowing with a little bit of cool
[SPEAKER_11]: wind.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you just kind of like the cool down
rates way quicker.
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly you're guessing But it's a fun
one to play when you've got great resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah This looks pretty good I approve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry sift or bubble?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be plenty hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I wait or should I go in?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd give it maybe 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, 10 seconds it is This is the curve.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is And you use that to direct the
flow of your resin on the inside.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: You let me know when you want me to drop
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps a little warm Crazy a little warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a warmer for sift and a little
oil
[SPEAKER_08]: The prototypes are a little bit cumbersome
compared to the more modern tricycle I
[SPEAKER_08]: think you scaled them down to around 10
inches now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotta talk pretty loud when you have the
torch on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the stratosphere has scaled these
pieces down to around 10 inches now versus
[SPEAKER_08]: about 13 where it's at right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a big boy, but it chugs
nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: The four second rip I did hit out of it
because it was so quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: A tricycler.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd give it like 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: You give it like 15 then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally like smoking resin at a lower
temp than higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people tell me, oh if you use a
q-tip it's waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Waste to taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just like taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the effect too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes through nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfectly hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, even with me it was a little hot,
but that strawberry banana comes through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine bubbled beautifully.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get one for Cam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to q-tip this?
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we get to head out of here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my first time trying the
strawberry banana from Concentrated Decks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to DNA for this flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving it a little bubble too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The double.
[SPEAKER_03]: The double.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble and sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me when you want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give it 10 seconds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good test is out too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find if you put the resin on top of the
banger you'll see how the resin reacts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good way to see how hot it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you've pressed bubble
already.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's powdered it's a little bit
harder because it takes longer to melt.
[SPEAKER_12]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash bollums, if I could tell you how many
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me personally I'm a little bit more
clumsy, especially if I'm dealing with a
[SPEAKER_03]: little jar after 20 turps dipped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spilled a couple jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've left a couple jars out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, we're done with our little
quick three dab sesh.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to head up to Shannon Falls.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to show you a little bit of
the view off of my front door here with
[SPEAKER_11]: the drone.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're going to drive
[SPEAKER_11]: up to Shannon Falls and give you guys a
little show over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So why don't we do that?
[SPEAKER_11]: See you there, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: See you there, boys.
[SPEAKER_11]: And girls.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so we just arrived here at
Shannon Falls.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just talked to a guy out in the parking
lot who had a drone.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got our drone.
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently it's totally legal to film
drones here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Should be good, eh, boys?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: This park is just fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that waterfall, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely windier over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_10]: And cooler.
[SPEAKER_10]: God, look at that tree.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pedestrian access to gondola?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't realize the gondola was so close.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's recording.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want recorded?
[SPEAKER_11]: Just me talking a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so we finally got here to
Shannon Falls.
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually got here twice.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got here, we hiked up, almost ruined
Brett's nice shoes, and realized I didn't
[SPEAKER_11]: bring this cable that connects the phone
to the controller, which basically
[SPEAKER_11]: connects the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I guess the point of the thing is
that we're back now after buying a cable
[SPEAKER_11]: in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're going to give you some of this
drone footage.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we might even have a few dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: But for now, we're going to the drone
footage.
[SPEAKER_11]: So hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Free your mind and rock and come in.

[SPEAKER_03]: So what did you guys think of that
experience?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the craziest technology
experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuckin' Narbar.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We set that shit up high.
[SPEAKER_11]: We flew it over the waterfall.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got it pointed towards the chief,
the gondola, the ocean.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you guys will enjoy the footage.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, we are eager to have a
session.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna head over just around the
corner to the picnic tables and we're
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna do some dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace.

[SPEAKER_09]: so we got to our jam spot We're going to
get some water from the waterfall we've
[SPEAKER_09]: been filming We're going to puff through a
little of that water You need me to do it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you Yeah man
[SPEAKER_12]: It's such nice cold water, it's just
ridiculous So clean and clear As you can
[SPEAKER_12]: see, it comes from that waterfall So sick,
eh?
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so we thought we had it all set
up But unfortunately I forgot one cable
[SPEAKER_09]: for the D-Nail or the Dabinator And
because of it we're going to go banger
[SPEAKER_09]: torch, torch banger style this time around
And we'll start with that Green Crack God
[SPEAKER_09]: 73 I was thinking of just using the jar
for the car
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was pretty fucking awesome drone
footage
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good to go almost right away?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to fly the drone, it was real
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty nice sitting right
beside the water The end of the waterfall
[SPEAKER_02]: Filled up with long water with some water
from the waterfall, so yeah All in all,
[SPEAKER_02]: great day, good session We're about 20
minutes from the city Yeah, a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of a hike That was beautiful Real nice
pace, we hit it right around the right
[SPEAKER_03]: time I think if it only took
[SPEAKER_02]: a nice rip I seen that This guy just
pulled out a boulder to the side We're not
[SPEAKER_02]: doing Q-tips today No Q-tips today It was
good It was good Anyway, I've got the
[SPEAKER_11]: camera angled so you can see Shannon Falls
in the background Hope you guys appreciate
[SPEAKER_11]: that This is an easy place to find if
you're coming to Vancouver and you want to
[SPEAKER_11]: check it out It's just north of Horseshoe
Bay, about 30 minutes Just south of
[SPEAKER_11]: Squamish on the way up to Whistler On the
Sea to Sky Highway, the 99 Highway We're
[SPEAKER_11]: right off the highway Boom boom Well the
banger never lets down when you've got the
[SPEAKER_11]: torch and the quartz banger It's just an
easy way to make the session happen no
[SPEAKER_11]: matter how many times you forget your
goddamn cords
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again we got the Technicolor Green
Cycle Niche stratosphere It's beautiful It
[SPEAKER_12]: feels like happy
[SPEAKER_03]: Been in my pocket all day
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you We're really toughening it out
here guys We're doing a lot for this It
[SPEAKER_11]: is the advantage to actually heating it up
to that point where everything is just
[SPEAKER_11]: crammed and baked right off Some people
are probably cringing that we're not
