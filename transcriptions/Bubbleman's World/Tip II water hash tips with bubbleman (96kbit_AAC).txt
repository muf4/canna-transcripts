[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to give you guys another
little bit of a tip on bubble making.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be tip two in the Water
Hash Tips with Bubble Man installment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I wanted to talk to you a little bit
about ice and the use of ice and how
[SPEAKER_00]: important it is in the extracting of our
resins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wax membrane of the glandular
trichome, as you know, becomes brittle in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a photo of a trichome right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a DJ short blueberry grown by Doc
Atomic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the little wax membrane that holds all
those profiles, the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC and the terpenes inside,
it becomes brittle when we use ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want a lot of ice being present from
start to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always want the ice to be able to have
access to knocking back and forth and
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting directly the heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were confused when they
saw my video and saw that I put all my ice
[SPEAKER_00]: inside my Bubble Now bag, but I put very
little to no ice in the actual Bubble Now
[SPEAKER_00]: machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was due because the water was
extremely cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a chiller or you're using
extremely cold creek water, you won't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to use as much ice for the purpose of,
you know, keeping the water cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll only really need to use ice to do
its job of knocking those resin glands off
[SPEAKER_00]: of their bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tip today is really use as much ice
as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really use too much as long as
you can get it turning with a spoon or you
[SPEAKER_00]: can turn it in your Bubble Now machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pack as much as I can and I pack good
ice in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not use store-bought fluoridated ice if
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use this ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to destroy your hash,
but if you can, I like to use a solid
[SPEAKER_00]: half-moon ice that is RO or distilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our tip for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll finish it off with a bong rip with
you and thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see
you next time.
Bye.
