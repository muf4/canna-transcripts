[SPEAKER_06]: Hey everybody, welcome to Hash Church 2.0,
the past, present and future of
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporization.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today we're going to do a little
vaporization dialogue.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some good folks that I'm going to
invite in and I guess I should get them in
[SPEAKER_06]: right away with the email.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, my friend Kevin from Team
Steam Jamaica is having a hard time
[SPEAKER_06]: getting in on his phone, but I'm hoping
that Gary from Uptech and Linus Vapor
[SPEAKER_06]: Brothers and Steve from Seventh Floor and
Sebo from Vapex Hail will all be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: come in and we'll all be able to have a
little bit of a conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did also send out an invitation to
Everett from Verdomper to Jurgen from
[SPEAKER_06]: Volcano and as well as Task Rock from
Highly Educated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess I wanted to start out before
everyone comes in, I have sent out that
[SPEAKER_06]: email.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to send my regards to the family
of Dennis Perron and all the people that
[SPEAKER_06]: he supported over the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you that don't know,
Dennis was a huge cannabis advocate,
[SPEAKER_06]: just passed away at 72, legendary cannabis
activist who kindled America's medical
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana revolution in the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a great article on Leafley about
his passing and a little bit about what
[SPEAKER_06]: he'd done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wanted to shout him out and John
Entwistle, his husband, sorry for your
[SPEAKER_06]: loss and yeah, we appreciate all the
amazing work that you did, Dennis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the real deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure, California and the rest of the
world will not soon be forgetting Dennis
[SPEAKER_06]: Perron.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, welcome Mr. McCoy.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going great, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I just missed the Perron tribute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I had to shout out Dennis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I had to shout out Dennis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you've got your stories as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark McCoy from Vriptech, an old time
friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Geez, we go back a good solid close to 20
years, don't we?
[SPEAKER_09]: We do, we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got Gary in the room who just
showed up from Uptech and W9.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is the creator of the Omnikron and the
Hercules pen, as well as the Bubbleman
[SPEAKER_06]: Trinity pen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So welcome to you, Gary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can hear you perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to the dialogue today,
boys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think actually, you know, between the
two of you right now, you might be two of
[SPEAKER_06]: the people that take this shit the most
serious when it comes to the love of
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporization and sort of the ability to
not lower your integrity to acquire the
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that might be easier rather than
fight through those obstacles with the
[SPEAKER_06]: high integrity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone with high integrity knows you just
come up with more obstacles when you can't
[SPEAKER_06]: lower your integrity to make it work.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope I can explain this correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to actually get something of high
integrity, you have to go up against the
wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wave is where the low integrity is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going up against the wave,
you're doing something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I put this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing something that is a lot
different than what everybody else is
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a lot different than what
everybody else is doing, you're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: being seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, people take notice of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you're getting
drowned as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to look into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole situation of... Well,
David Suzuki put it beautifully when he
[SPEAKER_06]: told me about his show.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was like, you know, when I got the
Nature of Things show, I really thought
[SPEAKER_06]: that I was going to be this gem on
television.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I quickly realized when you get
tossed into a cesspool, even if you are a
[SPEAKER_06]: diamond, you quickly take on the
appearance of what is in the cesspool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, that's a really good
metaphor, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you tie yourself next to a dog,
you're going to learn how to be a dog one
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's basically the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take on the appearance of wherever you
are at, just like a person having the same
[SPEAKER_01]: accent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they live in the South for a long time
or in Europe for a long time, it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's laughing that I brought up David
Suzuki.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, man, David Suzuki was awesome in his
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Nature of Things, that show was
wicked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it shined through.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it was not just taking on the
appearance of the cesspool.
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, welcome to Sabo from Vapixale,
who just made it in with the beautiful
[SPEAKER_06]: rainbow-colored wall behind him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, Sabo?
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bless up, brethren.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bless up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that who we got coming in now?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Linus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Linus, Vapor Bros.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, welcome, Linus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, welcome, Vapor Bros.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are all represented.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we got a good little group here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how many more we're going to
have.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did invite my friend Kevin from Steam
Team Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it would be kind of a fun thing
to have the almost, you know, not the
[SPEAKER_06]: original, as McCoy reminded me the other
day of the Scythians, which I'll probably
[SPEAKER_06]: start in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll go through a small history of
vaporization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is just an article I found online
that I figured I would read to everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once I read the history of vaporization,
anyone in the room that wants to sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: toss in their history and where they fit
in or if they feel that something's a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit different, it's not the word of
God.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just an article that I found
online that I thought had a nice kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: little history that I fit into pretty well
because I, you know, I was in Amsterdam in
[SPEAKER_06]: 1994, 95 when Eagle Bill was there with
his vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I met Mark McCoy fairly early on in
the game.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've been I've met the volcano
people the year they released the volcano
[SPEAKER_06]: at the Canna business in Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met Jurgen and his daughter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a fairly my own version of the
history of vaporization.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why don't I go right to that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it open here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll probably share it on the page as well
so people can see what I'm what I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: reading.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this will be quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once we do this, what we'll do is
we'll go through and each of you can
[SPEAKER_06]: introduce yourself and sort of talk about,
you know, your passions of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_06]: how it led into vaporization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here I'm going to just keep your mic
muted, Gary.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys notice, I'll probably mute
your mics when they're unmuted.
[SPEAKER_06]: That way, if you go to talk again,
just remember you got to unmute your mic
[SPEAKER_06]: because often we get some sort of feedback
noise here.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me change the screen saver to show
everyone what this is going on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, application window.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: The history of vaping.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is from Herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe it was the gentleman Herb
who wrote it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was it's a couple of years old now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the history of vaporization herbs for
inhalation is a practice that can be
[SPEAKER_06]: traced back far back and across many
different civilizations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the history of vaporization herbs for
insulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we got that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly is vaporizing or vaping?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you've been living under a rock and
aren't sure what vaping is, here's an
[SPEAKER_06]: explanation.
[SPEAKER_06]: The basic technique since the inception of
vaping, either old or the new age battery
[SPEAKER_06]: supported vaporizers is the same
vaporizing heats the ingredients to an
[SPEAKER_06]: optimum heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: The optimal temperature range from
cannabis is between 180 and 210 Celsius
[SPEAKER_06]: for the perfect vape compared to joints,
bongs or a pipe that burns the
[SPEAKER_06]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_06]: The blends, whether they be oils,
wax or dry herbs, are heated to a level
[SPEAKER_06]: allowing the release of the materials,
but allow the temperature that would burn
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: As there is no combustion during the
process of heating, a vapor is released
[SPEAKER_06]: that is quite cool and non-irritating to
the user's throat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, unless you hit like 17 volcano bags
in a row without drinking tea and then you
[SPEAKER_06]: quickly realize how dry it really is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifteenth.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fifth century.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth century B.C.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the this is the one Mark was
talking about the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vaporizing to humans has been known to
date back in Egypt from the book The
[SPEAKER_06]: History of Herodotus, 1928 Dial Press.
[SPEAKER_06]: During the fifth century, B.C.
[SPEAKER_06]: Herodotus, who is often called the father
of history, recorded his accounts of the
[SPEAKER_06]: ancient practice enjoyed by Scythians.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Scythians take some of this hemp seed
and throw it upon the red hot stones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Immediately it vaporizes and gives out
such a vapor as no Grecian vapor bath can
[SPEAKER_06]: exceed.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Scythian delighted shout for joy.
[SPEAKER_06]: The steady heat from the baking stones
would produce a pleasant smelling vapor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fifteen hundred years ago, Afghanistan,
technically speaking, the first real
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporizer was invented by Irfan Sheik of
the Mughals, present day Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Safavid dynasty knows to us as hookah or
as water pipe, nargal, argala,
[SPEAKER_06]: quailan, shisha.
[SPEAKER_06]: About fourteen hundred years ago,
Mughals, then rulers of India,
[SPEAKER_06]: introduced hookah to India, which was then
more used to a chillum.
[SPEAKER_06]: The controversy over the invention.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is quite a big controversy over the
invention of the first vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a patent from 1927 USA.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one who came up with the idea of
the electronic cigarette is Joseph
[SPEAKER_06]: Robinson.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did it in 1927, in which he filed a
patent to the USPTO for the first
[SPEAKER_06]: mechanical butane ignition vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Robinson's patent was approved and
published by the USPTO.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little to his credit that he deserves,
he still owns the patent of the first
[SPEAKER_06]: nicotine vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that one's from 1960.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was the dawn of the modern day inventor of
e-cigarette.
[SPEAKER_06]: Korean veteran Herbert A.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gilbert, the modern day vaporizers,
until this day are claimed to be built on
[SPEAKER_06]: the blueprint of Mr. Gilbert's original
design.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Gilbert to this day works for the
emperor e-cigarettes who bought his
[SPEAKER_06]: technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1990 to 1994, Amsterdam, father of
cannabis vaporizer Eagle Bill has a
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis community cult following known to
discover the popularizing of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: He turned his device safe and effective
alternative to smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: For over a decade, he was a favorite
exhibit at the Sensei Seabank's Hash
[SPEAKER_06]: Museum in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's definitely where I met him,
as well as at the Pax party house and as
[SPEAKER_06]: well as at Lucky Mother's in both 1994 and
95.
[SPEAKER_06]: The museum attracts visitors from around
the world and Bill enjoyed sharing his new
[SPEAKER_06]: technologies to any willing inhalers.
[SPEAKER_06]: A resident of Amsterdam for 12 years,
this was soon before the 1994 cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_06]: Sensei Seeds gave Bill space and he blew
away the crowd with his new technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Truly, if anyone was at the early cannabis
cups, it was really, really hard to miss
[SPEAKER_06]: Eagle Bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy was an incredible energy and an
incredible advocate for vaporization.
[SPEAKER_06]: It remained the most popular exhibit at
the cannabis cup for 10 years,
[SPEAKER_06]: earning Bill and Sensei Seeds numerous
first place cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: Soon he set up shop on a daily basis in
the Hash Museum and used that platform to
[SPEAKER_06]: turn the world onto vaporization.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eagle Bill was introduced to vaporizing in
1993 by a California grower who used a
[SPEAKER_06]: heat gun to vaporize aromatic blends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just in case you didn't know, everything
in the cannabis industry always started
[SPEAKER_06]: with a California grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to say that now,
whether it's water hash, whether it's
[SPEAKER_06]: like, it's just everything came from a
California.
[SPEAKER_06]: You follow the history back.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always the unknown California grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made everything, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, I'm not going to deny it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in an effort to design a more
affordable means of vaporizing,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're simultaneously raising public
awareness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eagle Bill invented the shake and vape
based on, sorry, based on the very same
[SPEAKER_06]: ancient Egyptian methods Eagle Bill's
glass pipe vaporizer that heated the
[SPEAKER_06]: bottom of a glass bowl with instead
lighting the cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pioneered by a native American,
the shake and vape was nicknamed the peace
[SPEAKER_06]: pipe of the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eagle's Bill invention would be the
catalyst for rapid technology and product
[SPEAKER_06]: developments in the vaporizer industry and
a big inspiration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill passed away on 22nd of May,
2005 in Georgia, USA.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 1994 BC vaporizer, Canada claims to
have invented the first electrically
[SPEAKER_06]: charged vaporizer inspired on Bill's Amado
design.
[SPEAKER_06]: BC vaporizer still is running in business
today and our inventors of solar power
[SPEAKER_06]: charger charge vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was however, stores and Bickel company
in 2000 that invented the new era of
[SPEAKER_06]: desktop vaporizers and named it volcano.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like it's work around.
[SPEAKER_06]: The history of vaporizers as controversial
as it sounds still holds the timeline
[SPEAKER_06]: benchmark and technically makes hookah the
oldest vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Modern day vaporizers credit no doubt goes
to everyone involved in the process,
[SPEAKER_06]: but still credited to late Bill Amato for
his pioneering endeavor to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a little article written by
Herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that everyone's not present and
that really kind of stops in 2000 where it
[SPEAKER_06]: really sort of picks up steam and all of
these different companies started to come
[SPEAKER_06]: into play, but kind of a neat little
timeline.
[SPEAKER_06]: If any of you guys have anything you want
to fix on that timeline by all means add
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can imagine maybe Mark McCoy has
something to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was, I thought that was
pretty well done.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there was a number of different
iterations that came off the Eagle bill,
[SPEAKER_09]: including myself, very much so inspired by
what Eagle was doing with the heat gun and
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of got, got keyed in by Doug Mignola,
an old childhood friend of mine from
[SPEAKER_09]: foster city that also ended up in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for me, just coming from that one hit
snap through school of water pipe smoking
[SPEAKER_09]: West coast where you know, if you overpack
the bowl and you couldn't snap it through
[SPEAKER_09]: yourself and enjoy the fresh, you will,
you, you were punished by snapping through
[SPEAKER_09]: that ashy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you packed a freshie for your bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just was looking to emulate that
same sort of ritual and philosophy with
[SPEAKER_09]: vapor.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I took the heat guns and developed
the, the chamber bowl concept.
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, just a big fan of the water
pipe and the moisture conditioning
[SPEAKER_09]: component.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, it's important to note
that, especially with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: the heat and the dryness is really what
does the damage.
[SPEAKER_09]: So hot and dry vapor will still dry your
throat out and irritate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in fact, I remember a long afternoon
pulling off that volcano with you in BC
[SPEAKER_09]: and waking up the next morning and
realizing, man, we should have ran that
[SPEAKER_09]: through the water pipe a little bit more
than we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's going back for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That must be a 2001 or 2002 that you're
talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We definitely have been at it for a while
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark was one of the first people to show
me, I guess, simultaneously between Mark
[SPEAKER_06]: and Everett from the Verdamper who I also
invited onto the show today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if he got the message.
[SPEAKER_06]: It went through his website and they
weren't checking emails for 48 hours and I
[SPEAKER_06]: sent it a little bit late, but he would
have been also great to have on the
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time I ever hit the Verdamper,
I think it was at Soma's place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although maybe they also had one at Lucky
Mother.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had one at Lucky Mother's instead of
the heat gun, the strange little sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: element that Everett made.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, between Mark and Everett,
back then, this is early 2000s,
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess what I had seen, I had seen Eagle
built, and Eagle was hitting out of this
[SPEAKER_06]: huge giant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was very hard to get the vapor
super, super concentrated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so from the connoisseur, from the
hardcore, chronic, You know, we were
[SPEAKER_06]: always looking like, oh, this volcano is
really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: If only we could make it so 100 bags were
in one bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was always kind of like the
mentality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, how can we get this for concentrated
to the point where I'm actually,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, because obviously it was a
beautiful thing to be able to hit the
[SPEAKER_06]: vapor and have it just the taste of it and
the smoothness of it and the subtle
[SPEAKER_06]: nuances of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very, very different for anyone
that ever went from straight burning
[SPEAKER_06]: joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nineties, we were all just burning joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then all of a sudden someone was
trying to show you, oh, you can vaporize
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was right up there with putting water
and ice and pot in a bag and trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: tell people, don't worry, we're not going
to ruin this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just making hash right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like, what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like people throwing that herb away,
like big, big bags of the vaped herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, yeah, we're done with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people were like, no, I could,
I could sell that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, listen, you don't want to sell
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is pretty much the worst thing that
you could possibly do.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about vapor brothers?
[SPEAKER_06]: When did you guys come online Linus?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you definitely, you're muted right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I muted your mic and you want to,
you want to be as close to your mic as
[SPEAKER_06]: possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause when you turn away a little bit,
the mic is cutting out slightly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as long as you're close, your voice
will pick up real nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, when did vapor brothers come
along?
[SPEAKER_06]: Still muted.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's usually a little button.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you muted again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit that one more time and wait for the
delay.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, about 97, 98 winter of 98,
we were really doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hear you perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: My history was a lot of going to college
and a lot of trying to cut down,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, a lot of trying to help friends cut
down on smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and so I was making very tiny
pipes with very small bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it was also trying to stretch
supply because in 90s LA, it wasn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it super easy to, um,
get good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, uh, trying to smoke these tiny
bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly I realized that I got way more
effect for way longer using less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was doing that at the same time as
my friend was investigating vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the BC vaporizer was out and there
were a little, they're handhelds.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was called a etara.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we had just discovered the rip
tech, maybe a year later we discovered and
[SPEAKER_02]: we actually talked to Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran into him in, in, uh, Malibu once
got a great lecture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he has a lot of info to, to give,
but, um, what we, uh, hated about the,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, vaporizers that we had was that vapor
went into a glass bowl, uh, and it got
[SPEAKER_02]: stale there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you went to take your hit,
the vapor just went around in circles and
[SPEAKER_02]: we really wanted to, um, make something
that created the vapor and put it into you
[SPEAKER_02]: right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend was tinkering.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took apart some parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He put them back together with like a
nugget, uh, floated in a piece of pipe
[SPEAKER_02]: that we connected to and, uh, heating
iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got a hit and I recognized cause I
was in physics classes and stuff at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time that he was drawing, um, hot air out
of a heating element and through the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we realized very quickly that the best
way to vaporize was, um, pure convection,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically heat air and pass it through
herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't touch the herb to hot, um,
metal or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and basically that's what Mark McCoy
was doing on a large scale, big diameter,
[SPEAKER_02]: big airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, what this etara vaporizer,
a little handheld vaporizer was doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it would burn your lips and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We came up with basically here's the
diameter that we ended up with,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is about, um, 11 millimeters on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the perfect bowl for me,
a little big, um, little small for others,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it ended up being like our standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we think we came up with was the
good, sharp, strong, moist hit from the
[SPEAKER_02]: smallest amount of herbs, um, but still
big enough for a few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this thing would get people too high,
which basically once my co-inventor called
[SPEAKER_02]: me and said that he was in the fetal
position, I was like, wow, we're onto
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do something with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important because the world was
smoking and we needed to impress smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like, you know, trying to get
onto vegetarian food or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you try it and you really just want a
burger afterwards, because maybe you ate
[SPEAKER_02]: something that was not heavy enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once, you, you can get this heavy enough
and get this strong, sharp, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: thick vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think you can go back to smoking and
you can't because you're, you're affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course the effect was longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was great because like if it wears
off, you can vaporize more and you get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get right back up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, whereas smoking is more like coffee to
me, like it goes way high and then crashes
[SPEAKER_02]: and you smoke more, you get more,
more sober.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's up with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, that was our start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can talk forever about this,
but basically where we think we came in
[SPEAKER_02]: was, well, quiet, small could be in your
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's beautifully painted,
but it, um, the main model, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring one out a little later.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wooden box.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is painted by my girlfriend,
Lindsay's artwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's doing a project with, um,
with visionary artists on our vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: but basically just connecting and drawing
a big breath of fresh air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, I could go into it forever
cause we, we got really micro with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we thought we had to do was,
um, popularize the notion of vaporizing
[SPEAKER_02]: though, cause it was really unheard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before volcano came out and went on 60
minutes, it was totally unheard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were trying to convince people once
you get three hits into them, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: proselytized, they proselytize others.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're in the religion almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we spread kind of exponentially and
eventually we tried to just become the
[SPEAKER_02]: most common vaporizer in the world through
our knockoffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got knocked off immediately over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some were improvements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most were, were just cheapenines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, this angled wooden box that I drew
one night on an all nighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like that your knockoffs have
knockoffs of knockoffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that is crazy now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's flattery Linus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great analogy too, with the vegetarian
and, uh, just the few things that you said
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have to mention the BC vaporizer
because I'm sure nobody wants to throw
[SPEAKER_06]: that thing under the bus, but I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it was pretty much the worst vaporizer
on the planet yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like the one that sold so many back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I know the guy who invented it,
he sold thousands of them, thousands upon
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands upon thousands of those
vaporizers were sold.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were the ones with the little pan
and the dome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to give them their place because
they almost popularized the notion of
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporizing without really vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll give them another props because
it was Shona Banda, who was basically
[SPEAKER_06]: wasting away from Crohn's disease,
getting arrested in the Midwest,
[SPEAKER_06]: having her threats of her child taken.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when she came on the hash church and
she talked about the oil that she was
[SPEAKER_06]: using to help save her life from Crohn's,
she wasn't doing MZT.
[SPEAKER_06]: She wasn't doing coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: She wasn't doing Rick Simpson's.
[SPEAKER_06]: She wasn't doing any of these oils or
bubble hashes or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: What she was doing was she was collecting
the condensed cannabinoids and terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: profiles from inside one of those dome
vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was collecting that oil and that
oil damn near saved her life, if not did
[SPEAKER_06]: save her life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once again, it's always easy to judge
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always to be easy to be like,
oh yeah, that thing's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no place for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a place for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very important thing for people
to see those full page ads and cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: culture and high times magazines back in
the day and to start putting their money
[SPEAKER_06]: into vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, some could say it was a bit of a step
back when they ended up getting it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all it did was really brown your herb
and kind of not really give you many,
[SPEAKER_06]: many rips.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll definitely say it was probably in
the late nineties that I started hearing a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot about vapor brothers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I looked at it, I was like,
okay, this is a much better design.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, so, and I'm sure that that BC
vaporizer helped you guys come up with
[SPEAKER_06]: what not to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if I could admit our first model,
number one was a BC vaporizer that had
[SPEAKER_02]: been taken apart, the heating element
exposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my co-inventor basically stuck a piece
of pipe thread straight on it and sucked
[SPEAKER_02]: air through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was wanting to draw the heat out of it
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was recognizing the convection going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, they launched us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did the eTERRA.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other BC vaporizer and eTERRA
both got us into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were what we had noted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we all have to stand on the
shoulders of giants, all the people that
[SPEAKER_06]: come before us, all the people that come
after us.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we get stuck in our ego
sometimes and we think that we're this
[SPEAKER_06]: individual and that we're the innovators.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing this, we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's no innovating.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, bubble bags would have never
existed without isolator bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was first seeing the isolator bags that
gave me the idea to add screens and to
[SPEAKER_06]: actually innovate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not copying when you make a
product better and you innovate and you
[SPEAKER_06]: stand on the shoulders of said giant to
move things forward to that next level.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of how we've gotten to where
we are today with so many different
[SPEAKER_06]: incredible vaporizers on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say it is not copying but I
understand about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you give acknowledgement to where your
product came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give acknowledgement to where you got
the inspiration for your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these companies will just take
right now your design and just be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we're the ones who did it first,
where they don't even give acknowledgement
[SPEAKER_01]: to the companies before them that actually
pioneered the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you're in a difficult situation
because you're in the pen market and
[SPEAKER_06]: you're like the only person in the pen
market with high integrity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're like, you are in the biggest
cesspool of them all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that when you first went to China
to try and develop your designs and you
[SPEAKER_06]: threw all your terrible designs into the
garbage that were not going to pass Gary's
[SPEAKER_06]: integrity test, what happened to those
plans that got thrown into the garbage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got to understand China is a
communist nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The IP belongs to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though that the designs are there,
they're not being used, but they are being
[SPEAKER_01]: shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody from an engineer from another
company has access to the designs that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had that was being given to our previous
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole story is almost 90, 90 to 95% of
the designs that are out there are
[SPEAKER_01]: basically based on what I have done since
the year 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2012, I was at a show and my original
oil tank that we had coming out that came
[SPEAKER_01]: out in 2011 and I was at a show and I'm
looking at this guy, this company sell the
[SPEAKER_01]: tank and knock off of our tank and I
approached him and I asked him,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, what's good about this tank and
what's different?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference between this and
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's telling me, he's giving me his
sales pitch and he's saying, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: we did this, we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, you understand that I'm the guy who
designed this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're telling me that it's doing things
that it's never intended to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looked at me like, oh shit,
I was just trying to con the guy who
[SPEAKER_01]: actually designed the tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at him like, you guys even
understand what you guys are doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're taking a design that's not even
yours and just marketing it as yours and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's like, oh, we changed the mouthpiece
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that doesn't make it a different
design just because you changed the
[SPEAKER_01]: mouthpiece on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's companies like that that are out
there right now that are just causing a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of problems for companies that are
actually in it for the purposes that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: in it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Linus said, he was there for just to
bring a better device to the market to
[SPEAKER_01]: allow people to get away from combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got in it because a lot of people that
I've met couldn't smoke and eating wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: the option for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to deliver the fastest way
possible for THC and CBD to hit their
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way to do that is the
pulmonary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it through the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do I put this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit difficult seeing the
world, the way it revolves and how people
[SPEAKER_01]: are attracted to marketing, bullshit
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I can say right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not only bullshit marketing,
but like pricing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could just copy someone's product,
make it a fraction of the price because
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a fraction of the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people gravitate towards that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell you how many people have
bought really bad knockoff bags and then
[SPEAKER_06]: contacted me and been like, these bags
fell apart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Material fell into my hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: The screens blew out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, yeah, yours were so expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't really want to jump into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, yeah, but mine are warrantied
for life.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like, I'll take care of you with
customer service.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's what you have to look at
generally for a quality product that might
[SPEAKER_06]: be a little bit more expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get really good customer
service.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get incredible warranty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're not going to be bummed out if
something happens on a fluke because the
[SPEAKER_06]: company is going to take care of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You buy a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You won't even be able to get back in
touch with that company unless you push
[SPEAKER_06]: like one for sales.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you push two for customer service,
it just rings and rings and rings and
[SPEAKER_06]: rings and rings.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to pretend you're buying more shit
from those motherfuckers to even answer
[SPEAKER_06]: the phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, it's usually the same person too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That picks up the phone for support and
sales.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got to, you got to understand
it's not only, it's not only that the
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect of it is the original company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take for instance, like let's say company
who came up with the design, they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: spend research and they have to spend
money on research and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to spend money on molds and all
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can't produce it in the United
States because of cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, the costs are outrageous when you
actually produce something in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us to protect our IP, even if you
produce it in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: China can still copy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Linus knows, he's taking companies
to court, taking other companies to court
[SPEAKER_01]: for IP infringement is a lot of work and a
lot of money being spent on ridiculous
[SPEAKER_01]: lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you produce it in China,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now China has your IP, they can
literally copy it and sell it to somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the original company that has spent the
money on research and development gets
[SPEAKER_01]: shafted because now their product has to
be priced at, let's say a hundred dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: while the knockoff comes in, doesn't have
the overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they can price the same product for 50
bucks and still, you know, the walk away
[SPEAKER_01]: with profit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's for sure a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like anything, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That you have the innovators, you have the
passionately fueled innovators who without
[SPEAKER_06]: them, it would just never, the products
would never come to be because these are
[SPEAKER_06]: the people who are spending their time and
their energy focusing on how can I make
[SPEAKER_06]: this concept work better?
[SPEAKER_06]: How can we make, you know, and so it's not
really about like, I just want to make
[SPEAKER_06]: millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not about that at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can kind of tell in the product
and in the integrity of the person who's
[SPEAKER_06]: releasing that product, they really love
their product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's important to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But once again, it's business,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's this cesspool of business.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you slowly take on the appearance,
that metaphor of jumping into the pool
[SPEAKER_06]: full of shit and trying to not look like
shit at the end of the day is a tough gig.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one other facet to that guys,
you know, you have the people that have
[SPEAKER_09]: integrity and are more business oriented.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they have the integrity license from
the innovators, license from that
[SPEAKER_09]: impassioned group or individual that
sought the intellectual property,
[SPEAKER_09]: did what they were supposed to do to get
their protections.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they put their product out.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're paying a licensing fee back to a
royalty back to that innovator.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then their product has to be a couple
bucks more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they get beat up because their
product is a couple bucks more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the knockoffs benefited that same
impassioned innovators technology and
[SPEAKER_09]: they're not paying the royalty.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's important for just
consumers out there to recognize that
[SPEAKER_09]: there is some value in spending a few
bucks extra supporting the company that
[SPEAKER_09]: actually pays the royalty to the
innovators to keep supporting the
[SPEAKER_09]: innovators to keep innovating.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am one of the very few people who do
that very thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I paid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have paid royalty fees for bubble bags
from 1999 all the way up into the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've I've leased Reinhard Delp's patent
for water extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like one of I'm like one of four
people who have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you just say rest in peace?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did he pass away?
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my understanding.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Too long ago, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Geez, I was that's insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wondered why I hadn't heard from him.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the support in the family,
though, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did the right thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was very happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a very few handfuls of us
that did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Payloads bags did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Triple extractor from out east and Canada
did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were the only companies that paid
him royalties on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly, when you follow that history,
I'm not going to get into the whole thing
[SPEAKER_06]: right right now, but because it but it
does kind of play into the conversation
[SPEAKER_06]: that we're happening that we're having
right now about.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you just the innovators just
want to innovate.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just want to like just create and do
new things with what the product that we
[SPEAKER_06]: have is we want to make it better in some
way, which often the problem with that is
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of people think, well, what would
really be better is if it was cheaper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's that's not really better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got to understand what one Mark
was talking about paying royalties and all
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we came up with the very first
cotton, this oil cartridge, we were
[SPEAKER_01]: approached by a massive distributor who
was in the vaporizer industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: literally told me if I cannot distribute
this product, I'm going to knock it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either you either sell it only to me
or I'm going to knock it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was literally like, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I and I told them,
well, how are you going to knock off my
[SPEAKER_01]: patent?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, it's very easy to circumvent a
patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to change something on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it doesn't have to be big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to change something and I will
bury you in lawyer fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going after patents anymore
because to even patent something in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry is almost it was nearly
impossible in 2011, 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: And till this day, it's still very,
very hard to patent something in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paraphernalia itself cannot be patented.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of them have patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you got to look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when they do have patents,
they're still knockoffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't save anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So royalties, it takes it takes the
individual who wants to license it to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pay royalties for this guy,
even if he doesn't have patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but he developed the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it takes the individual person
takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this industry, ninety nine point
nine, nine percent of the people are not
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will literally use you and toss you
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll claim, oh, we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we got to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: They turn around and stab you in the back,
which is crazy because what they're really
[SPEAKER_06]: saying is, can you put your hands together
and give me a little boost?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're like, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you bend down, they step on the
back of your neck and jump.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not what I meant by standing on the
shoulders of giants, just so you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so why don't we go through?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we kind of have in a way already,
but why don't we go through our histories
[SPEAKER_06]: of how we've gotten each of you guys,
how you really got into the passion of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and then how that led you.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, many years later, that's what I
really want is the timeline to
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporization.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to start, Gary?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the early 2000s, I started working in a
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a medical laboratory where we did
blood tests and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked my way up until I ended up owning
the laboratory itself, where I've met a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people that would come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would do we would draw their blood for
the testing and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And meeting a lot of these patients helped
me understand because at that time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not for cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was totally against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, to me, it was just another drug
because I was brought up in a conservative
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So meeting these Joe Strati.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said Joe Strati.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were a Joe Strati.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were a Joe Strati and then you started
to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in about the mid 2000s, when I started
talking to these people, they helped me
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that they actually started
helping me learn how to grow because we
[SPEAKER_01]: became friends with a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2007, they approached me about
opening up a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2008 is when we were able to open up the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were opening up the dispensary,
I saw one of the people using an
[SPEAKER_01]: electronic cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I saw it, I'm like, how cool
would it be if we can put a tincture in
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the only thing at the time was
literally glycerin, cannabis infused
[SPEAKER_01]: glycerin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, how cool would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the gentleman that was smoking it was
a very good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, well, I tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't work because you take the
cartridge apart, everything falls apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't put it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can, it doesn't absorb too much
because there's cotton in there and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set out on a journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the 2009, 2010 era, we met a
gentleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met a gentleman that was actually on
the same path as we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he almost figured out how to put the
glycerin inside the inside the electronic
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we worked hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still difficult because of the
cotton inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we met up with Michael Bacchus from
Cornerstone Research Center in Eagle Rock,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when he said, I will put this on my
shelf if you can get rid of the cotton
[SPEAKER_01]: inside the oil tank, which was based on
electronic cigarette technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, you had to have cotton to be
the medium to hold the glycerin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time I said, well,
it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, well, I'll put it on my shelf if
you actually can get rid of the cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went back to the drawing board and I
went through maybe about 50 prototypes and
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of fees doing the molding and the
research and designs on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2011, we introduced the first oil
tank that had no cotton inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what revolutionized the industry
because when you look at it, every other
[SPEAKER_01]: tank had the cotton and had the heating
element wrapped around it or inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after a few hits, you would actually
start getting that burnt taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2011, when we introduced that,
we sat back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like patting ourselves in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we did something where nobody else
was able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before the 2011, we were also able to
get pure oils into the cotton cartridges,
[SPEAKER_01]: which nobody else was able to do as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fast forward after 2011, 2012,
2013, we had another design that had the
[SPEAKER_01]: ceramic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we're talking about the,
where you said, oh, your designs were in
[SPEAKER_01]: the trash and nobody was using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden it just became
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the late 2012, 2013 era,
we came out with the essential oil tank
[SPEAKER_01]: that had the ceramic wicks and all of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we only did a small production run of
a hundred to get a feedback of people and
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had issues and it just didn't work
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we shelved that whole design and we
decided to go a different route with the
[SPEAKER_01]: KISS cartridge where it's load as you go
lake systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we shelved that idea,
we actually totally forgot that we shelved
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea with a manufacturer that we don't
work with anymore because after 2013,
[SPEAKER_01]: we decided to open up our own
manufacturing because most of our ideas
[SPEAKER_01]: and designs are being literally licensed
out to other companies where we had no
[SPEAKER_01]: control over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we shelved that idea and we went
well concentrated on the Hercules and the
[SPEAKER_01]: KISS cartridges in 2013, early 2013,
afterwards we went, we started working on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Triton series and which has yet to
come out and all our designs where we
[SPEAKER_01]: reinforce the KISS cartridge made it even
better and better every year with every
[SPEAKER_01]: iteration of it coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the last two years I was looking at
it and all of these cartridges seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: come out and had the pre-fill market
within the past two years where it started
[SPEAKER_01]: booming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at the cartridges,
I'm looking at it, I'm like, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is my design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I've done in the essential
oil tanks since 2008 up until 2012 is now
[SPEAKER_01]: being used in the refill market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I came out, I'm like,
hey dude, that's my design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, no, that's not your
design.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're just acting stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not your design.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, listen, man, I even have forum
conversations and I'm showing images of a
[SPEAKER_01]: ceramic core back in 2012, 2013 on tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: These new tanks are using the same design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's changed, but it is based on
that design because it's still,
[SPEAKER_01]: so fast forward until now, we introduced
the pure titanium grade heaters inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridges and we introduced the silicon
carbide wicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2013, when we started using the silicon
carbide wicks, we started calling them
[SPEAKER_01]: black ceramics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them black ceramics just for fun
because we were pretty sure that the
[SPEAKER_01]: companies out there would start calling
them black ceramic without knowing what it
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll fast forward to 2016,
2017 and 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018, when companies started putting black
ceramics into their oil vaporizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: we started calling our silicon carbide.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being silicon carbide, because it was
silicon carbide, we just called it black
[SPEAKER_01]: ceramic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now companies are like, oh,
well, well, now we're offering black
[SPEAKER_01]: ceramics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a silicon carbide too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for two years, you didn't know what
was inside your cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were calling them black ceramics.
[SPEAKER_05]: You baited them well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we started calling them silicon
carbide, all of a sudden, left and right,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're coming out with cartridges that
have now silicon carbides in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if they now have silicon carbide in
them, what do they have before?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just ceramic painted black.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fast forward until now, how do I put
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our main goal was in 2008 was for the
patients and by the patients because I was
[SPEAKER_01]: financed by patients, by old hippies,
by old grandmothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally the people who helped me build
the dispensary are the people that helped
[SPEAKER_01]: me finance the ideas that I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until this day, I will never give up
on that where if my company is going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: down, fine, I'll go down swinging,
but I'm not going to market bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to use bullshit marketing
tactics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to bullshit anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the whole story of how we came
into play is because I saw an electronic
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette and because Michael Backus said,
I'll put it on my shelf once you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of a couple of people along
the way said, you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess invention is the necessity of the
time where if you're not put into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: into a place where you have to get out,
you're not going to invent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I think of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pen market sure blew up in a big,
huge way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of like, you know,
not until I met your old employee there,
[SPEAKER_06]: Samurai Sam, when he came up and took all
these pens apart and showed me how
[SPEAKER_06]: terrible they were and how everything was
super close to the element and how solder
[SPEAKER_06]: was getting vaped and these cotton and
like all these different things and sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of started explaining to me about your
company, I was like, oh, okay,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, I can't like just be using these
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I use them a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd take them up on the mountain where I
didn't want to have a dab rig or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's definitely feels better when it's
this niche.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like for me, there's so like every
vaporizer company in here right now,
[SPEAKER_06]: every vaporizer, I have like 20 or 25
vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a whole variety because I find the
best one to be the one that suits me at
[SPEAKER_06]: the time that I need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the market right now, you have to,
I'm laughing myself and I'm sometimes even
[SPEAKER_01]: like pulling my hair out as why would
people say it's okay to use stainless
[SPEAKER_01]: steel as a heating element?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would people say it's okay to use
Teflon like a millimeter away from the
[SPEAKER_01]: heating element?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but right now that is the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's people literally don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how cheap you can make it and how
fast you can make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market itself, there's a lot of
dubious players in it where they've
[SPEAKER_01]: literally gone in and they give out 50
free samples and all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you like point out,
oh, well, it has this inside the heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they don't give you an answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an Uptek right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, the Omicron.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that moves us perfectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I muted myself by accident.
[SPEAKER_06]: That moves us perfectly into Mark McCoy
and the Fripp Tech company because when I
[SPEAKER_06]: first met Mark, he was like, yeah,
you got to have the Stein-El gun.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to have the ceramic core.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, ceramic core, tell me more.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you speak of?
[SPEAKER_06]: So why don't you give us your low down
mark on how you came to be passionate
[SPEAKER_06]: about vaporization?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, again, I was just coming from that
one hit snap through school of water pipe
[SPEAKER_09]: smoke and West Coast style.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, admittedly, I perhaps started a
little more on the recreational tint,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I've long time ascribed to Dennis
Perrone's perspective that it's really all
[SPEAKER_09]: medical because whether you're taking that
rip to chill and watch a movie or skate
[SPEAKER_09]: and create, you're still getting medical
benefit, whether you like it or not.
[SPEAKER_09]: As I got a little bit older and some of
the aches and pains kicked in,
[SPEAKER_09]: I realized I'd actually broken my back as
a teenager and had some pretty severe
[SPEAKER_09]: muscle spasticity coming from something
that wasn't going to easily heal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I realized that the cannabis literally
just made those spasms disappear so
[SPEAKER_09]: freaking fast without the side effects of
the pharmaceuticals that the doctors who
[SPEAKER_09]: in all their wisdom were prescribing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wasn't as active at the time because
I was a little bit laid up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I transitioned from water pipe smoking
with lighters to uncoated wood matches to
[SPEAKER_09]: vaporizing with heat guns.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just made really an organic
transition.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time, I'd been studying medical
aromatherapy, the work of the Swiss and
[SPEAKER_09]: the French, and was very interested in
natural cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And essential oils.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I want to say that was late 90s,
95, 96.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd gotten turned on to the Eagle Bill
vape by Doug Mignola and Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_09]: That sort of changed everything for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was working on a shower apparatus for
putting essential oils into your shower
[SPEAKER_09]: water flow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I woke up in the middle of the night
one night after playing with the heat gun
[SPEAKER_09]: for, I don't know, maybe three or four
months.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realized the fluid mechanics and the
gas mechanics were exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only way I was going to emulate
that real fulfilling full spectrum rip I
[SPEAKER_09]: was able to get out of a small glass bowl
with very careful, slow lighting with the
[SPEAKER_09]: wood match was with the Venturi effect,
Bernoulli's principle.
[SPEAKER_09]: I realized, well, shoot, it's been right
here in front of you the whole time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I developed the concept of the
two-piece vaporization chamber bowl,
[SPEAKER_09]: wrote some notes, middle of the night,
went back to sleep.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the next day I was in Berkeley,
California at R&D Glass, basically
[SPEAKER_09]: groveling to get them to make some pieces
for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I told myself at the time I was not
going to enjoy any cannabis until I
[SPEAKER_09]: figured it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it might just be a couple of
iterations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, I thought naively I might
nail it right out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the flow form physics, lo and behold,
a little more complicated than one might
[SPEAKER_09]: think.
[SPEAKER_09]: Took me about three months.
[SPEAKER_09]: My bros were all very happy to be the
guinea pigs.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll never forget when we finally
figured it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we created a chamber bowl that worked
really well with the old Stein-El guns.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd already looked at some of these
heat guns.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been in the history of some of the
cannabis pioneers playing with them for a
[SPEAKER_09]: while.
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured out that the Stein-El German
design, Swiss manufactured ones,
[SPEAKER_09]: had a stainless nozzle and a non-alumino
ceramic encapsulated nichrome element.
[SPEAKER_09]: So your air was actually going past the
ceramic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the stainless.
[SPEAKER_09]: And although far from perfect,
it worked pretty fricking well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rigged up with a nice size water pipe.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were able to dial in the technique
to get really full profile vapor right to
[SPEAKER_09]: the edge of smoke or just barely beyond if
you wanted that hybrid experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or even lower temp and just vaping on the
terpenes, if that was your thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that led to all kinds of
experimentation with other herbs and
[SPEAKER_09]: botanicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mixed and on their own.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, eventually with the inside
of my beekeeper bro Nebu, our beekeeper
[SPEAKER_09]: bro Nebu, we started playing with
propolis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really vaporizing the same way the
Scythians did.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they always had propolis on their
rocks in those steam tents.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were throwing their cannabis seeds
there by the article in herb.
[SPEAKER_09]: But remember, where do seeds come from?
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeds are in the flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Scythians also get credit for being
the first to really vaporize specifically
[SPEAKER_09]: flower material.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, here we are today.
[SPEAKER_09]: We took a few iterations on the bowls.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultimately, glassblower Steve there
inspired Jason King with some of his
[SPEAKER_09]: inside out pieces on soldering irons.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I paid Steve to make some iterations
for us that we played with for years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seba was one of the early adapters.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got to play with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember just not thinking the world
was ready for a hot piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in fact, I'll give Seba a lot of
credit as one of the bros who really was
[SPEAKER_09]: like, man, you got to just turn people
onto this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, we took a few iterations,
getting the elements right, and getting
[SPEAKER_09]: the glass sorted so that we could make it
in a production environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still the hardest piece we make.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you dial into it, if you like the
ritual of water pipe smoking, do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Milk it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: To your taste, you can dial it to the way
you like to session.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to beat, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I still get a lot of emails from folks
just saying, I love the system,
[SPEAKER_09]: but you kind of ruined everything else for
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that based on the hot glass?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the hot glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Brian's brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Brian's brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Brian was the one that turned me
on to it, but he told me really it was his
[SPEAKER_06]: brother that kind of designed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess he would blow the glass for
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that's great that you guys are
still doing those.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was lightweight and easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It went in and out of the bowl nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it definitely was glass on glass on
glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we now have glass screens.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have custom tool joints.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can pretty much plug and play on
any water pipe or bubbler out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, all glass, heating extraction
and delivery.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I've found is even relative to
many of the technical ceramics that I've
[SPEAKER_09]: played with, you simply can't get a better
terpene expression than with all glass or
[SPEAKER_09]: quartz.
[SPEAKER_09]: That neutral polarity of those materials
really does make a difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are talking terps quite a bit these
days, but it's not just about the
[SPEAKER_09]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about the polarity, the energetic
component.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're using a metal element or
metal chambers or even metal screens to
[SPEAKER_09]: some extent, you're changing the
expression.
[SPEAKER_09]: From what you would have got just in those
first couple of pulls off a proper cone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Agreed 100%, particularly having a terpene
company and having access to terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: profiles derived from cannabis and having
access to all these different vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It leads us beautifully into Sabo from
Vapix Hale because the Vapix Hale was the
[SPEAKER_06]: first unit that I found I could
legitimately preserve the terpene profile
[SPEAKER_06]: from pure terps because I was hitting them
on like a D-nail, like a sick dish or a
[SPEAKER_06]: sapphire dish or quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were delicious, don't get me
wrong, but it wasn't until I hit it
[SPEAKER_06]: through the Vapix Hale on super low temp
in the quartz rod, dropped into the glass
[SPEAKER_06]: tube with the heated, like just the
preservation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the word I use constantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, it preserves the fucking
profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is almost what it smells like when
you smell it in the jar rather than it
[SPEAKER_06]: just, it made me realize how different it
was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Convection versus conduction, I guess you
would say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like putting it right on that dish and
having it just explode is not as gentle as
[SPEAKER_06]: having it go into the Vapix Hale tube and
just like gently volatizing out into my
[SPEAKER_06]: bubbler.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why don't you go ahead, Sabo,
introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us about the Vapix Hale and how you
came to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's relatively new, but your
history might go back further.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked about standing on the
shoulders of giants and well, there's one,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm staring at him right now, Mark McCoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I give a lot of credit, actually pretty
much everything I know I owe to Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky enough when I started
consuming cannabis as a 21 year old,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really late to the game just because
I felt that as a health conscious person,
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to put any smoke in my body,
but I had been a stunt man putting myself
[SPEAKER_03]: through college and the injuries were
building up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally I started utilizing some
cannabis and I bought the first vaporizer
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought was the BC Vape.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then ultimately I bought the VripTex
system and I noticed that the return
[SPEAKER_03]: address was in the same hometown that I
grew up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately I emailed Mark,
he allowed me to come over and I'd only
[SPEAKER_03]: been consuming cannabis for a few months
at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he was really educating,
not just the vaporization aspects of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, but just cannabis in general,
very holistically, how it was grown,
[SPEAKER_03]: how it was cured, how you make hash,
how you trim it properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel very, very lucky from the get go
that I was learning from a Yoda Jedi
[SPEAKER_03]: master.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he kind of introduced me to a bunch of
different people like I remember the
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble bags, like he was telling me all
about hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point I was just getting into
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this hash thing was like way beyond me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately he showed me all these
different systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved the heat gun system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I introduced so many of my friends in
college to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when he moved to the glass wand
style, it was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as he mentioned, I was really
encouraging him to really get the word out
[SPEAKER_03]: and to really promote this type of
ingestion methodology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just love vaporization in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought the Vapor Brothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a customer of the W9 UPTEC products as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: His sales rep used to come over and show
me the ins and outs of how to use the pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just feel really, really blessed to
be here to be able to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: vaporization in general and also kind of
what inspired me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately Mark is also a,
well, he not only influenced me on healthy
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis consumption, but Mark is a very
active person.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also eats a very healthy diet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tried to emulate a lot of those
things and really try to be a healthy
[SPEAKER_03]: person holistically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just with my cannabis consumption,
but with how I treated my body with
[SPEAKER_03]: exercise, what I put into my body,
even some spiritual type of development as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately, I had bought over 150
different vaporizers from 1997 to 2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that time, I had been working at a
startup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the startup was really close to
Mark's house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my boss, after we had sold our company
to the sales force, my boss was asking me
[SPEAKER_03]: what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told him I had been helping Mark
sell vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately he asked if he gave me some
capital, if we could design one ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the impetus for creating the
device.
[SPEAKER_03]: I called my good buddy Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told him I had this opportunity to
create a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if he'd be OK with it, he gave me his
blessing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I think we were talking about at the
beginning, I mean, Dennis Perrone just
[SPEAKER_03]: passed away yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people here that
influenced us, that gave us this
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's important to let Mark
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's been to my wedding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were on an airplane together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a chance to catch up recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I've never told him this,
he is the guy that taught me everything
[SPEAKER_03]: and the reason I'm sitting here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's my story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it didn't put people to sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, Sable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice shout out to Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Too kind, David, too kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was pretty accurate,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've known you a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would agree with pretty much everything
he just said.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was stoked to get you on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually remember the stories John was
telling me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, I'm actually going to go
meet Sable at VapeXcel and talk about his
[SPEAKER_01]: VapeXcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Evo at that time was coming
out in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the model, Sable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he actually was meeting with you to
talk about the Evo and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told me that you guys were actually
using the Omacore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The older versions of the Omacrons,
where you guys had your sessions together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we can meet up because I
even told him back then, I wish I was up
[SPEAKER_01]: there with you guys, get to meet and sit
down and talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully after this, we can all
exchange contact information, talk to each
[SPEAKER_01]: other about the industry and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something good should come out of this,
I hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is the beauty of what
BubbleMan is doing here with this program
[SPEAKER_03]: is bringing a lot of people together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I kind of feel it's weird that
Mark and I are speaking more now over the
[SPEAKER_03]: show than we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just live a couple of miles away from
each other, but we'll make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, with you, I was actually talking to
a bubble man, Mark, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, hey Marcus, I got this
project I'm doing and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: promote it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, well, you know,
Mark from Vriptech and he's already got
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he goes, he's already got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, I knew your company,
I just didn't know it was a full glass air
[SPEAKER_01]: path.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you just said it right now,
this full glass air path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm thinking I should go back to the
drawing board again, because I need to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it different now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a different design.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working on something that's a
desktop, that's full glass air path.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only difference I think between
ours and yours is you use a ceramic
[SPEAKER_01]: heater, we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ours is designed to look like a
spaceship because everything in our
[SPEAKER_01]: company is named after sci-fi stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Star Trek fan and a Futurama fan,
because as you can see, we have our
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizers named Omicron Percei 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that idea was given to us through
another friend as like, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have your Omicron, why don't you
call the second one Percei and the third
[SPEAKER_01]: one Nate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, well, let's do it since I like
Futurama.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, after we named all our
products, Futurama did an episode about
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know that, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Futurama did an episode about us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teeter Terrestrial, that's what it's
called.
[SPEAKER_01]: The episode, I think it's season seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teeter Terrestrial, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But either way, you know, looking at going
back retrospectively, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when you showed me that, Sabo,
the bubbler that you have, there was a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of talk in 2013, 2014 with people knocking
off, because I think you own the patent
[SPEAKER_01]: for the joint on the bottom of the
bubbler, don't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was a lot of talk on the
forums of people knocking that off and how
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not going to be doable and all of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But either till this day, you know,
people are still knocking it off and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty difficult for you to go after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I look at the patents the
same way as you, which is they're kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like nuclear bombs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never use them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just threaten them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if people decide they're going to play
chicken with you, then you guys could have
[SPEAKER_03]: a legal battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the clear winner is typically just the
attorneys that are getting paid all those
[SPEAKER_03]: billable hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is such a tough thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is such a tough thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the hundred percent truth right
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Linus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for all the work that you put into
a patent and we got patents too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for all the work you put in,
there's some good that comes out of it
[SPEAKER_02]: because it deters large businesses from
knocking you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll deal with all these small things
that you can't whack a mole or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would cost more money than
designing new vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't do it just for the kind of
the hippie ethic of it's better to put
[SPEAKER_02]: money into developing your next thing and
staying relevant rather than trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: fight people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, the deterrent value,
I think, is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we've all been helped for all of us
who have spent time and money on a patent
[SPEAKER_02]: and paid the lawyers so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone like Volcano or a giant company,
well, maybe they would knock you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my theory is that they don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people with pockets won't rip you off
straight off when you have a good patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that's prevented a lot of us
from being knocked off by actual serious
[SPEAKER_02]: competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got to understand people with
pockets won't knock you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they will bury you in legal fees just
to make sure your patent is invalidated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look at JP Morgan Chase and Tesla.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made sure that Edison got his patents
and Tesla was basically invalidated after
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we've gotten now after Sabo to
Linus.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you kind of told your story a
little bit, but give us the full sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: like vapor brothers.
[SPEAKER_06]: But before, the passion that led you to
want to do this and kind of get deep into
[SPEAKER_06]: wanting the vapor brothers to be the most
sold vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the passion that goes way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: The memory doesn't always go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that far back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember that it seemed like pot was
a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like people around it were good
people, many.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like it helped people to be good
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when I learned about acid,
that's such a time commitment and it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: little scary, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like weed was a good substitute
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of a poor man's acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that I realize how hard life is
for a lot of people, I realized I was kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of a privileged kid because I was able to
go to college and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, when I proposed to my
parents, he's pretty conservative,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I wanted to do in life, maybe they
would come back with, well, what's that
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do good for the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of invalidated a lot of
things that I might want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: With my life that were just like fun or
neat or ego driven or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, OK, I'd better use my my
tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't doing that well in college.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in I was like a permanent student.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it allowed me to take a lot of
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I thought I should bring together
the things I've been taught from the
[SPEAKER_02]: engineering or interest in physics,
anything from computers and the world
[SPEAKER_02]: history and now health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of led to me trying to make
these tiny bowls because I was actually
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of looking for less body impact
because smoking really does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you smoke as much as you can until
you're coughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going for that vaporization,
once we discovered our way to do it was
[SPEAKER_02]: really well, less body impact doesn't just
mean you vaporize and feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can vaporize more and feel fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as marijuana started becoming
clear medicine, this isn't just
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational, this isn't just for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: These aren't just kids trying to get high
and and call it medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are actual patients needing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It became an important thing and kind of a
kind of a coincidence with us wanting to
[SPEAKER_02]: impress smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our device was great for taking of
medicine because it created some high
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures that we believe brings out,
converts the THC into very pain relieving
[SPEAKER_02]: components.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm I'm stating that wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the higher temperatures that we were
getting on this, which is basically you're
[SPEAKER_02]: riding the fine line between vaporizing
and smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not a pure vaporizer unless you turn
it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at its normal setting, when you're
drawing it, you're kind of riding this
[SPEAKER_02]: fine line between getting it too hot and
not hot enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, you're impressing the
smokers because I think you're creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the same components that they are
used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of that quick effect plus the body
effect to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But moving ahead, I was also, as I
mentioned before, was trying to cut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to be a better student and
it wasn't helping.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was helping with creativity,
but math not not so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't that great at math.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but my attempts to cut down created
this kind of stronger, more efficient
[SPEAKER_02]: alternative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never felt like people quitting cold
turkey anything is a great thing because
[SPEAKER_02]: the thing is not necessarily bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to cut something down, it's nice to
find something that is stronger in its own
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so vapor became this stronger
alternative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people were surprised to know
that we still smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever, do both.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing that we told people who
were not impressed by vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: The vapor is not doing it that much for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to smoke smoke also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they they got an effect that was way
beyond what they could have if they had
[SPEAKER_02]: just smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of those people went to vapor
full time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started getting reports back from
people that had changed their life or
[SPEAKER_02]: saved their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing about less body impact also
allows people, as I said, to smoke more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some people who really need the
medicine, like some people were simply
[SPEAKER_02]: depressed and marijuana would make them
less depressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that little kind of substitute
for acid effect, it kind of would help
[SPEAKER_02]: them come into a more perfect like
personhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can think certain things through
and you can get somewhere sometimes in
[SPEAKER_02]: your mind on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with these people able to take
more, they couldn't take enough smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their lungs were done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people were a lot older than us and
were like, I can't smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't smoked in years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with your vaporizer, I do it every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this thing has saved my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we hear that a few times,
we realize we're on to we need to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's good for the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's so many things I could get
into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there were a lot of people who
helped us along the way and who really
[SPEAKER_02]: became the Vapor Brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vapor Brothers is not just two brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a brother, but my partners were
like our bros and a lot of some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for us to start spreading faster,
we lived in Venice at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to get to Woody Harrelson as
fast as possible because he had helped
[SPEAKER_02]: another hemp company called Hempstead.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the first like really good
looking hemp clothes in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be fashionable and wear hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't all like rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pointing at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is though.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't just like rough and ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of shiny and finely made
fabric and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of blew up and made Woody not
want to invest in companies anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But through his friends who actually took
our company and made it into a thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were so into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one guy, his name now is Hippie Steve
and another guy named Dr. Richard
[SPEAKER_02]: DeAndrea.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hosted me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hosted the Vaporizer and they
introduced it to everybody who came
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of these guys had a music studio
in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to, he called it Smoking Toads,
his band.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to do something similar to Smoking
Toads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they weren't actually harvesting
from toads, but they would make music to
[SPEAKER_02]: go along with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could listen to this music when
you did DMT and it was like, you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: really listen to normal contrived radio
friendly music for going on such a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: He vaporized everybody who came through
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were people who were recording their
jazz bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, oh, we only smoke joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only smoke bombs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd like, well, try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were converted basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was helping them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, we were very kind of hippie
dippy, like wanting to reject the world of
[SPEAKER_02]: toxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toxic food was extremely popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like vegetarian food were just
becoming really palatable and good and
[SPEAKER_02]: thick and heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And greasy and lovable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we hope to do that with Vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn it from something that might be a
little too light or stale or have other
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons why people would not want to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me fast forward again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also wanted to make a device that was
very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: With this toxic world thing, we wanted to
get all the toxins out of the Vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with me knowing that our formula was a
very hot heating element inside,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost 1000 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the surface of the heater.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be that way to heat the air
quickly and give you the 400, 300 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: air that you need to flow through the herb
and vaporize the herb just right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that hot is going to smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it smells, you're inhaling
particles of that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's a hot heating element,
you smell hot metal, you're smelling a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of hot, hot ions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we converted over to
surrounding ceramic as soon as we could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot ceramic smells like hot stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's barely anything in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ceramic can handle, what, 3000 degrees
before melting or breaking down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this sits here at 1000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was very safe for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's glass around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the bottom is medical grade silicone,
which can handle the 400 degrees that it
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything in the box is meant to more
than handle what temperature it gets to,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if the box is upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the air vents are blocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point was we didn't want people
inhaling parts of the vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of vaporizers can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know with Mark's vaporizers,
he used the best heating, heat guns that
[SPEAKER_02]: he could get, the Stein-L.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Sabo came along, one of the things
that stuck with me when Sabo gave us some
[SPEAKER_02]: advice once was that he was wanting to
position his vaporizers like the iPhone of
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the all glass air path all the
way through to where the air is inhaled
[SPEAKER_02]: into the vaporizer, it stays within glass
and never picks up anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our vaporizer inhales from kind of the
inside and the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we did to every part in the box
is to remake it to be not exhaling smell
[SPEAKER_02]: when it gets warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would even redesign the LED board,
the controller board, to be correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: No parts get hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what makes cheap devices,
too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheap devices, when they put it in,
they don't do all the work to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that every component doesn't overload
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some resistors can get hot and start
smelling like burnt plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just the smell of Chinese stuff
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we did was try to lead-free
solder all the stuff that we wanted to do
[SPEAKER_02]: to assure ourselves that we could inhale
from this thing the rest of our lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not have trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also inhaled air into vacuum cylinders
that were sent to industrial hygiene labs,
[SPEAKER_02]: which would test the vapor, test whatever
might be coming off the vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we made sure that we got it good to
where our vaporizer was safer than just
[SPEAKER_02]: inhaling air like in your office.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, the air in your house and
in your office is not that great,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially after your laser printer has
printed a paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing, people are very worried
about metal ions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry doesn't know about metal
ions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole manufacturing world around there
doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the material is not melting,
they think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something that could be really hot
could smell like metal when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: inhaling those metal ions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got rid of the metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But while we still had the metal,
we had to realize we just simply simplify
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't pick, like what Uptek mentioned,
stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want chromium coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick simple materials like iron and the
nichrome wire that we had to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: could off-gas something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But make it small.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I realized was your kitchen has
an electric range that has almost the same
[SPEAKER_02]: materials running at almost the same
temperature at a much larger scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're inhaling that forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't make anything just perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always going to inhale something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our point was to make it much better
than what you're inhaling every single
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the point, Linus, you're saying is
we want to reduce the amounts we're
[SPEAKER_01]: inhaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to make it more by adding a
box vaporizer, by adding any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to increase that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to reduce it where we're basically
some of us actually trying to reduce our
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's what you're trying to
say, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Call it a harm reduction device.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the very beginning, vaporizers have
been, haven't they been called harm
[SPEAKER_02]: reduction devices?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Mark, did you use that term?
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's through all three of our
utility patents.
[SPEAKER_09]: We pushed the concept of harm reduction
for smoking of any botanical, not just
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I mean, what you said in the
middle of Linus really, I think,
[SPEAKER_09]: will stick with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think is a good way for the viewers to
think about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't vaporize your vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're using a vaporizer that
requires you to vaporize your vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_09]: even just trace amounts of it,
it's probably not the best vaporizer for
[SPEAKER_09]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a harm reduction device is a good term
because, especially with e-cigarettes,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just side step over to actual
e-cigarettes with juice, propylene glycol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the stuff that's in them, whatever,
it's a harm reduction device.
[SPEAKER_02]: You vape a bunch of e-cigarettes,
you're going to live a whole lot longer
[SPEAKER_02]: than if you burn cigarettes into your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with harm reduction devices,
it's not like there's zero harm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're inhaling a moisture into your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what lungs are meant to take
in, but I don't know if they evolved to
[SPEAKER_02]: inhale a whole bunch of particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And moisture, but it is so much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard with, you know, I don't know if
it's just Americans, but we're very all
[SPEAKER_02]: one way or the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of right now they're finding
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this is a whole nother
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're finding out that there's a little
bit of benzene in marijuana when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: cooked, especially at very, very high
temperatures like having on a very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very hot surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're finding that and what they're
finding is less than what you're inhaling.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people are like, oh, my God,
I need to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to things that have more, you know,
harm or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd like to wrap up just a few
thoughts of where we were going with this,
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: The not tasting your vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of practical implications
for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For one thing, with vaporizing,
you taste what you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purely someone who produces material can
use a vaporizer to test how pure their
[SPEAKER_02]: material is just by their taste buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, your your your taste and your
smell can tell a lot of things that it
[SPEAKER_02]: even takes test equipment to find out,
you know, the odor threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain chemicals above the odor threshold
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sorry, I go in circles sometimes,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think you said something very
accurate there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the other practical thing was this
is getting back to the well, reliability
[SPEAKER_02]: of it and not inhaling things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We with not the biggest budget ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a little bit of help from Woody
Harrelson's friend, not from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a little from him, but more like the
heart help with not a lot of money to make
[SPEAKER_02]: this thing work better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed to simplify it and we just have
less parts in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And simplifying it also meant no fan,
no reliance on flowing air in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really respect the companies who do have
good electronics, temperature controls,
[SPEAKER_02]: fans and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really hold the temperature right
there where they say they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing has no temperature readout.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just evolved our method to not need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really nice about this device
in the middle of the night, like at one a
[SPEAKER_02]: .m.
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm not all into acid or anything,
but just to bring back that story,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say everybody is on mushrooms or
something in the house and we're all kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's finally kind of gotten to
its place and people are kind of going
[SPEAKER_02]: deeper and someone realizes they want to
vaporize, you know, smoke or, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, let's vaporize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, pull out your thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We we had a volcano.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I very much respect volcano for
being it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can talk about that for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we had a volcano and a vapor
brothers on the bar in this guy's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the thought of turning the
volcano on in the middle of the night,
[SPEAKER_02]: crackly, crackly, you know, bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody used this because the only sound
it makes is the correct whistle that you
[SPEAKER_02]: should hear when you're pulling the air at
the right speed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's psychedelic friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is absolutely quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that became part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that also, I think, helped it get into
a lot of people's houses because people
[SPEAKER_02]: were not ready to have anything that they
would call paraphernalia being out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: open, especially when their parents came
home or friends came over or or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of scary to have this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tried to make it very beautiful so
they could stay on their counter and not
[SPEAKER_02]: look like anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing actually rode around in the
automobile and no one would even want
[SPEAKER_02]: someone actually broke into a car to steal
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pretty proud of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for a long time, no one recognized
this as anything else, a pencil sharpener.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a good beginner of like how we
how we spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, we became OK, we need to
become a company and we became a
[SPEAKER_02]: corporation, you know, and corporatizing
caused me to have to split up with my main
[SPEAKER_02]: partner, which really sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a co-owner and I had to buy him out
and and that that sucked heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he couldn't hang with the corporate
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of what corporations have to do
is totally antithetical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the right word?
[SPEAKER_02]: To a lot of our kind of hippie ethics,
but we continued with ethics.
[SPEAKER_02]: As being our strong suit, also without a
lot of money, if you're a good person and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're ethical and you're helping people,
you spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need money to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never spent money on marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We eventually figured out how to do ads
and they were always so so odd.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you had to do it to get out to to
stores and to go to the the trade shows
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, we rode on trying to be good
people, have good product, keep improving
[SPEAKER_02]: it and not do the things that seemed wrong
to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's basically where we still are,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually really it's awesome just
someone new came on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: To see all five, now six of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, man, you really got the innovators
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I try to put the you know,
once I built the traction of the channel,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was kind of like, oh, what should I do
with the traction of this channel?
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I turn my channel into a cheesy
bubble bag advertisement center where I
[SPEAKER_06]: just sell all my products shamelessly?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do I invite all the other innovators
that I know that are some of the many of
[SPEAKER_06]: them are even more inspiring than the
things I've done and sort of share that
[SPEAKER_06]: traction and then have them help grow it
and build it even more.
[SPEAKER_06]: It brings us thanks for sharing Linus.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a great story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like really important,
not just to us, but I think for the
[SPEAKER_02]: movement, because even all those
knockoffs, they still rely on us to come
[SPEAKER_02]: up with stuff we created.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all here created an industry that they
see as money and they're raising their
[SPEAKER_02]: kids on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our employees raised a bunch of kids,
you know, and and they do even though
[SPEAKER_02]: knockoff seem like like a pest,
they aren't going to keep going and
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizing is not going to keep going
unless innovators like us keep trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: do what we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just pushes you to go to the next
level.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's perfect timing because it brings
us to task who just came into the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally stoked to have you here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, you know, I just only have seven
days to organize and curate this show for
[SPEAKER_06]: each week.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Sundays over and then tomorrow,
Monday.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I got seven days before I got to
have the next show ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sorry I didn't put the invitation
out earlier to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that, you know, one of the
things that task did with the electric
[SPEAKER_06]: nail and the highly educated products is
you really took this whole like
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporization thing made it even more it
made it the ultimate for convenience for
[SPEAKER_06]: for the dabbing world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, maybe even was I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to share your history right
now with us once I shut my mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not sure if like it was even the
start of the dabbing culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we were doing hot knives and
the mayor existed for doing the hot spoon
[SPEAKER_06]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: But dabbing, really dabbing, like heating
up a dish with the electric nail like that
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty much coincided with the release of
your product, did it not?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I can't unmute you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to push the mute button on your
screen there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mute everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear you.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first off, don't worry about the
late invitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always say if you wait until the last
minute, it only takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're all good on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as highly educated goes,
you know, there were nails before we
[SPEAKER_04]: started.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, you talk about building on the
shoulders of giants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have just purchased my first titanium
nail back in 2010 off of Aqualab.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they were sold out immediately
after, so I couldn't buy another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends couldn't buy one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a friend who was a machinist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just took the nail over to the
machine shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: We made a few modifications and just
started making them for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: After several weeks, I looked at Aqualab,
saw they were still out of stock and
[SPEAKER_04]: realized that there was a potential
business opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I sent him an email, just said,
hey, you know, we have these available.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm stepping on anybody's toes,
if I'm violating a patent or someone's
[SPEAKER_04]: design or intellectual property,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turned out that the person who was
manufacturing at the time was a gentleman
[SPEAKER_04]: named Cabley.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys are familiar with
the Cabley nail, but it was the titanium
[SPEAKER_04]: nail that existed before highly educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had taken it from my understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is all a legend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that from one side of the story,
Cabley had taken money for an order and
[SPEAKER_04]: just kind of disappeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he created this vacuum that we
stepped into, started innovating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I owe a lot of highly educated success to
the people that I've surrounded myself
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been kind of, I would describe myself
as a lucky fool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, my machinist, Dave, who helped
me first replica.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is such a very left brain individual.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's always building his own servers.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's basically built his own Netflix
platform that's private where he rips all
[SPEAKER_04]: his own DVDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gives me access to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just this weird genius guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I had the idea of doing an
electronic nail because I knew that the
[SPEAKER_04]: torch for dabbing was seen as sort of a
negative connotation.
[SPEAKER_04]: People associated it with, you know,
smoking meth or doing weird hardcore drugs
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we wanted to try and remove the torch
from the equation if possible to make it
[SPEAKER_04]: more socially acceptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't really understand what we were
doing in the product or what we were going
[SPEAKER_04]: to get as the outcome of the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just had the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody can have an idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's easy to have an idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: The genius that did the email is a
gentleman by the name of Dave Jensen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just told him what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that other people were going to be
working on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured that it was important for us to
get to market first.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just put a lot of pressure on him
to come up with a design.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our first problem was back then the
domeless design didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just all dome and nails.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the hardest thing for us to figure
out was how are we going to get wires
[SPEAKER_04]: inside of this dome contraption and not
compromise the integrity of the airflow or
[SPEAKER_04]: getting the wires all gunked up and
reclaimed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just certain things around that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And during this time, we ended up coming
out with the V3 adjustable nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys know what that
is, but it was an adjustable nail for the
[SPEAKER_04]: domes that could make it adjust to certain
heights because not all glass contraptions
[SPEAKER_04]: came to the same standard sizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people had larger domes, other people
had smaller domes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the V3 nail could adjust up and
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, you know, that wasn't even my
design either.
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be attributed to the genius of
Chad from Healthstone Glass, who,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, another person in this industry
who helped pioneer some different
[SPEAKER_04]: vaporization essential products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he actually pitched that idea to me in
an online chat like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, all praise to Chad for
that idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after that came out, we started
thinking, OK, so what's next for the nail?
[SPEAKER_04]: What else can you do to these things?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we thought, well, what if the shaft
was hollow?
[SPEAKER_04]: What could you do then?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started thinking, well, the hollow
shaft doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was like, well, it does if you
take the dome away.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were working on a prototype.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right at that time, the first domeless
nail came onto market that I'm aware of
[SPEAKER_04]: was called the KO domeless nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe it was developed by a guy
named Kevin Nell.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I remember correctly, Gary might know
some more about that because I remember he
[SPEAKER_04]: was around in that time frame as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, once I saw the domeless nail and
once we had our first prototype of our
[SPEAKER_04]: domeless nail out, I immediately realized,
you know, we've unlocked the solution for
[SPEAKER_04]: getting the cables into the nail now.
[SPEAKER_04]: By removing the dome, we can now just get
a heating element wrapped right around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pitched the idea to my machinist and he
spent a week or two researching
[SPEAKER_04]: components, found a PID, found a heating
coil from a heating manufacturer who would
[SPEAKER_04]: go on to end up fucking us over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Later on, but that's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he got the sheet metal lasered out,
the sheet metal to cut and bend the
[SPEAKER_04]: housings for the electronic units.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these components like the PID came
from overseas, but as far as everything
[SPEAKER_04]: else, it was fully cut, built,
assembled here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he built four prototypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took one of them with me to the San
Francisco Cannabis Cup in, I think it was
[SPEAKER_04]: in 2010.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might've been 2011 actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where we showed it off for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a major hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the release of the email,
we started to kind of discover,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, lower temperature dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the email first came out,
there weren't carb caps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in order to put a dab on that would
fully cook off within your breath,
[SPEAKER_04]: it had to be set at 1085 Fahrenheit on the
coil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that everybody hearing that now would
probably be like, wow, that's incredibly
[SPEAKER_04]: hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But without a carb cap back then,
that was almost the temperature you had to
[SPEAKER_04]: have it set at to make all the oil cook
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so anyways, that was how the email
came to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean, I don't want to ramble on
too long because I'll start tying my
[SPEAKER_04]: entire stories all together.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was the invention of the email.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a guy named Dave Jensen,
who was a machinist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just pitched the idea to him and he
helped me make it come to life.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the end, you know, we only ended up
selling 150 units.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of a sad story for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So while we birthed the email industry,
we never really got to fully enjoy it due
[SPEAKER_04]: to that email coil manufacturer,
that whole other story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, you know, I could tell you at
another time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we could do a whole show on how we've
all been fucked over and out in our
[SPEAKER_06]: business trials and tribulations,
which is for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus, sorry to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember, I remember Tas coming out with
the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a hilarious story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in 2012, he came over at the Cali
Connection booth at the San Francisco High
[SPEAKER_01]: Times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he remembers that or not,
but he plugged the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in retrospect, it's hilarious right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a very, very sad moment at that
time where he plugged the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think half the show's power just
literally went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that, Tas?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't know what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turned around and were like,
ah, dude, we didn't even get to hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just took out everybody on like the
West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, dude, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I blame the show for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got it back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the email worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to add that the email did work for
the rest of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, it definitely did cause a little
power outage there for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually a prototype,
wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was one of the four prototypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my experience with the original one
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What year was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: He said 2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought 2011.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it might be 2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: My sense of time just not good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe me, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: To have the different groups of you guys
in here from like, you know, Gary with the
[SPEAKER_06]: pen aspect, with Mark from so many years
ago, as well as Vapor Brothers with these
[SPEAKER_06]: different, you know, produce your own air,
forced air.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time I ever ripped was
definitely like a memorable experience
[SPEAKER_06]: with Tas, with highly educated like
definitely helping popularize dabbing for
[SPEAKER_06]: certain.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first name I heard with the
titanium nails and the carb caps.
[SPEAKER_06]: So very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now Sabo out with the Vapix Hail.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, in my opinion, one of the kind
of younger up and coming guys that's just
[SPEAKER_06]: got the super flair and the excitement and
is able to articulate his message and is
[SPEAKER_06]: intelligent and has a great little unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Sabo inspired me before I ever got
into it, before I ever saw highly
[SPEAKER_04]: educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you were you stone monkey or
stoner monkey or something like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is my gamer tag on PS4.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anyone wants to find me,
stone monkey 55.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember I remember back in the day
before I even started highly educated,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was I was using the heat gun to vaporize
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even made a song about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavy duty, heavy duty heat gun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that all starts with Mark McCoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's how everything is a pain at war.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the first time I hit one of
those heat guns was probably from Eagle
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the first time it rocked me was
definitely with Mark McCoy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, yeah, that's because you just
got a rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to have this conversation
going.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I guess at that point in time,
we're just we're in the discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the current.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the present of vaporization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess, you know, if you guys want to
get into a particular type of
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation, I don't know if we want to
flow naturally or if we want to direct it
[SPEAKER_06]: into what we all think the future of
vaporization is.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're going to kind of hammer
out for the last hour of the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we still have a little bit of time if
we want to talk about the present still
[SPEAKER_06]: what's going on today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's a lot going on out there
as the cannabis industry blows up
[SPEAKER_06]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if vaporizers will really ever
finally transfer over.
[SPEAKER_06]: When Mark met me back in the day,
you must have been to the melting point
[SPEAKER_06]: and seen the inhalation station of
vaporization.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty early for its time because
because the law was illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But because the law was legal,
we had exemption 56 is we had these sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of M.A.R.
[SPEAKER_06]: licenses that people could have in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just use the mentality that,
well, it's not up to me to police people
[SPEAKER_06]: to see if they have a license to consume
cannabis medically.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just produce an environment where
they can come.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had a table with a variety of these
vaporizers from, you know, the Volitizer,
[SPEAKER_06]: the Aromat, the Thrip Tech, the Volcano.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there was a couple of others on
there that I might be forgetting.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just to be able to have people come in
and test the units on their own was such a
[SPEAKER_06]: nice thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used a lot of other herbs, and it would
be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've personally used herbs with bubble
bags and extracted hashes or oil extracts
[SPEAKER_06]: with, you know, microencapsulated oils and
trichome heads with the bubble bags using
[SPEAKER_06]: water and ice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wonder if, you know,
the popularity of vaporization clearly
[SPEAKER_06]: being fueled in passion by the cannabis,
both patient and recreational communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if the herbs will finally ever
break over and will start vaporizing these
[SPEAKER_06]: different herbs through all of these
different units.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, more than just trying it and
never doing it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in reality, all our devices are made
for herbs that are legal use.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, I'm in Canada where federally
it's legal to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And soon we'll have a federally legal
recreational system here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This year, we're supposed to get federally
legal rec.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that changes the game.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think all of you guys should come up
here and make some videos for your
[SPEAKER_06]: companies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think more progressive formulation is
going to be a big part of the future for
[SPEAKER_09]: sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And devices that are able to adapt to the
substances that you want to vaporize and a
[SPEAKER_09]: much broader spectrum of terpenes,
flavonoids, and various active
[SPEAKER_09]: constituents be able to adapt to the
user's preferences and or perhaps the
[SPEAKER_09]: extraction artists as they like to be
called preferences too.
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, being able to adapt the
device to deliver, you know, how much of
[SPEAKER_09]: the oil to the organoleptic experience,
the throat and mouth feel the flavor and
[SPEAKER_09]: how much of it to the formal kinetics,
the deep tissue, smaller particle
[SPEAKER_09]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, to be able to tune that
either in a way that's fixed, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: by the manufacturer, they can say,
this is what I think is right,
[SPEAKER_09]: or to the user's preference and perhaps
even be able to adapt to the user's
preferences.
[SPEAKER_09]: By artificial intelligence or machine
learning and looking at the way they're
[SPEAKER_09]: dialing and tuning their device and the
types of rips they're taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Mark, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I was actually going to state that
what you're saying is there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: to go from my understanding of what the
vaporizers can achieve because we've
[SPEAKER_01]: barely hardly started scratching the
surface because at this moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't fully understand the cannabis
plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we understand what cannabinoids and
how terpenes affect THCA and all and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the other different compounds is where we
can actually start designing vaporizers
[SPEAKER_01]: that might be maybe a three phase unit
where it starts at certain temperatures,
[SPEAKER_01]: goes up and down and back, you know,
sideways, whichever way you wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: design the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm saying is until we finally
understand the plant itself, we literally
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot design a unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense or only make sense in
my mind?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's a it's a very complicated
process.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this is why the pharmaceutical
companies have been fearful of cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: for so long.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's why it's a tough subject for the
regulatory agencies that are used to
[SPEAKER_09]: reductionist Western science.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing, though, that is very clear and
that is that just like growing in the
[SPEAKER_09]: natural sun, as opposed to growing under
artificial light, we know that with
[SPEAKER_09]: vaporizing, we are creating very
sophisticated spectrums.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, major cannabinoids become minor
cannabinoids, terpene expression based
[SPEAKER_09]: upon thermal gradients, the cannabimimetic
effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yes, no one has this understood
black and white to gospel, but we do know
[SPEAKER_09]: it's more sophisticated than how many
people make it out to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's where I think really it's
going to come into the line has hit on
[SPEAKER_09]: this earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the in my opinion, the
superiority of the human sensor,
[SPEAKER_09]: you can have all these complicated
sensors.
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the end of the day, you know,
from my experience, if it tasted really
[SPEAKER_09]: good and it felt really good, it worked
really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it didn't taste really good and it
didn't feel really good, it didn't work so
[SPEAKER_09]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not that is scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a doctor, but you got to understand
every person's chemistry is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we have people that like the
vapor brothers that use the vapor
[SPEAKER_01]: brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have people that use the V rep,
V rep tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have people that use, you know,
the vape Excel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just a preference where one unit might
not work for everybody, where there's
[SPEAKER_01]: different units out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think as bubble man said,
also, I own all of these vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I use them all differently at different
times, depending on the use case and my
[SPEAKER_03]: mood and and what what type of user
experience I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say it even gets more granular
than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, you know, just depending on your
circumstance, you know, you will utilize
[SPEAKER_03]: different devices.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, obviously mine is a plug
in portable devices have advantages there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then although both Mark and I have all
glass airpads, you know, I do find there
[SPEAKER_03]: is a distinct kind of resonance to his
device that is missing in mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there are times when I will
utilize this device instead of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it all depends on my preference at the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the great news is we all have
the option to to to have all these various
[SPEAKER_03]: options.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've got what was like Linus.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: People asking exactly, you know,
what do you think is best?
[SPEAKER_09]: I say what's best is what is best for you
at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's your ritual, your session.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the best bit?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it goes back to what Linus said
earlier, and he was like, oh, I don't know
[SPEAKER_06]: if it's an American thing, but we always
like we're over this way or over that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always one thing or the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's said to be for not for
North America, because Canadians have it
[SPEAKER_06]: in them as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been fighting it for the last 10
years, and it's why I'm much more into
[SPEAKER_06]: having a quiver than thinking that one
thing is better, like a one shot wonder,
[SPEAKER_06]: just one arrow for every shot I take.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to fit as many arrows in my quiver
as possible, regardless of whether it's in
[SPEAKER_06]: regards to hitting off of a surface on an
electric nail from titanium to quartz to
[SPEAKER_06]: sapphire to silicon carbide, all these
different surfaces.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like them because they they preserve the
terpene profile differently when I hit a
[SPEAKER_06]: dab off each and every one of them at the
exact same temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know something's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: My bioassay is pretty tuned for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say the way Mark was mentioning
earlier that that and Linus saying that
[SPEAKER_06]: that is science.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I remember running mint through
my bags the first time back in 99 or 2000,
[SPEAKER_06]: putting a little bit of the mint into a
bowl and puffing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I put a bunch of bubble hash and
a bunch of mint into a bowl, and I puffed
[SPEAKER_06]: that and I blew it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, wow, like I didn't cough
at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I punched into Google mint and
cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I came up with this like multi-million
dollar study that like Phillips Morris did
[SPEAKER_06]: on designing the mentholated cigarette.
[SPEAKER_06]: They spent like 12 million dollars to come
up with the fact that mint is a good thing
[SPEAKER_06]: to add into cigarettes to suppress cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it in like 40 minutes with like a
bong, some matches and a set of bubble
[SPEAKER_06]: eggs and a little bit of mint.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is value in these bioassays,
whether we're doing them as experiments in
[SPEAKER_06]: front of us or whether we're inhaling into
our lungs to taste these different
[SPEAKER_06]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's all about the quiver.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm so happy to see all of you
guys in this room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Tas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing with with,
you know, foods and beverages.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like some people don't like Coke
out of a can, but they love it out of a
[SPEAKER_04]: glass bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people don't like their food cooked
on certain materials or certain materials
[SPEAKER_04]: may cook more evenly and more better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you just, you know, where I find
inspiration sometimes is from spots like
[SPEAKER_04]: that when seeing how something cooks or
seeing how, I mean, even our newest
[SPEAKER_04]: product, shameless plug here on our new
product, we just put out a new quartz
[SPEAKER_04]: banger called the gavel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've got a textured surface on the
bottom, which favors the creation of
[SPEAKER_04]: nucleation sites, which helps facilitate
vaporization at exceedingly lower
[SPEAKER_04]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And kind of learned that from just,
you know, watching beer glasses and beer
[SPEAKER_04]: glasses that are designed to have,
you know, etched bottoms to help
[SPEAKER_04]: facilitate the carbonation separation from
the beer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting how a simple process like
adding that texture to the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_06]: gavel.
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminded me when you said it of Indra
talking about his hydrocarbon extraction
[SPEAKER_06]: machine, his extractor, and how by putting
these little divots inside his chamber,
[SPEAKER_06]: when he puts, because he doesn't have a
column like most of these products are
[SPEAKER_06]: made, mainly he does gas goes in and it
starts channeling and creating highways
[SPEAKER_06]: and it doesn't touch all the material.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he drilled all these holes into the
inside of his chamber.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when the gas goes in, it hits these
walls and it causes cavitation,
[SPEAKER_06]: which sends bubbles back into the material
and moves all the material fully a hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: percent of the time consistently.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that really reminded me of what you
simply did with your quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm feeling pretty good about this
vaporization conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're two hours in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where should we lead this convo?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'll throw in a topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anybody ever worked with a fractional
vaporization?
[SPEAKER_02]: And define it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a couple of years ago, we used
fractional vaporization is just a term
[SPEAKER_01]: that we made with the Hercules because
using urban oil at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but using the oil to heat up the herb to
vaporize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the heat created by the oil would then
heat up the flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower where you would actually heat
up the oil to vaporize as the vapor is
[SPEAKER_01]: passing through the herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: The herb gets slowly heated up and
vaporized, which would add cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_01]: other terpenes that are not in the oil
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like the perfect temperature
for the oil and the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: The herb likes a little less temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the oil, you need more
temperature to get that fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that, like I said, has anybody ever
experienced something like that or worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We use oil and herb together in a device
that predated our dab device.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just dab onto a ceramic surface
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before this came out, we had it in the
vaporizer, in our normal vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a way into the top directly down to
the heater, which was the right
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature we wanted the oil to be at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you connected the herb,
you created oil vapor and passed it
[SPEAKER_02]: through the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hard part was getting both to the just
the right temperature that they should be
[SPEAKER_02]: at.
[SPEAKER_02]: The oil at just the right heater
temperature we wanted it dropped right
[SPEAKER_02]: down right onto the heater surface in
there and the herb to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you got both though, that was the
best, that was the best I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys have tried, how about you,
Mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried anything like that with the
V-RipTec or?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I've definitely,
you know, back in the day put a whole
[SPEAKER_09]: bunch of patties of bubble hash on top of
fresh pack flour and melted it all
[SPEAKER_09]: together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, enjoyed that evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I understand about the patty part,
but have you separated where you actually
[SPEAKER_01]: would vaporize the oil first, then use the
oil vapor from the oil to vaporize the
[SPEAKER_01]: herb?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, there was the separation in
another glass screen.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have experimented with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of like you got your flour on
top of a glass screen and another glass
[SPEAKER_09]: screen on top of that with your
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Eventually they do sort of meld together,
but you are technically vaporizing the
[SPEAKER_09]: concentrate first, I guess.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little messy, but it can be fun and
tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, messy, I know that word.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened, Linus?
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like they should be really
close, but I mean, Gary, do you mean like,
[SPEAKER_02]: are they physically separated by a
distance or is it almost similar to
[SPEAKER_02]: putting wax right on top of your herb?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we experienced it with the Hercules
where we would load up the Hercules first
[SPEAKER_01]: and right on top of the ceramic rod,
we would put a metal screen and on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the metal screen, we will put the herb
where the oil is saturated right next to
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the oil sits right next to the
ceramic rod where it gets vaporized and
[SPEAKER_01]: that vapor itself gets pulled through the
herb, which warms up the herb itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after when the, when the oil is done,
it becomes a convection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say hybrid convection
conduction for the herb itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you get a different, subjectively
better effect when, when you experience
[SPEAKER_03]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I said, with my previous
statement where we don't understand the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the herb, the plant itself a hundred
percent, where we don't understand what
[SPEAKER_01]: each compound effect, how each compound
affects the other next compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it basically, if you, let's say if
you have OG oil and you have an OG Kush in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you get the taste of the oil,
but what happens is after that,
[SPEAKER_01]: when the herb kicks in, it just
intensifies it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the more compounds that are
found in the plant that's not in the oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: it actually intensifies the, the high and
it intensifies the effects that the oil
[SPEAKER_01]: brings, uh, uh, initially sets in.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a more sophisticated spectrum that
you're extracting and delivering.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this goes and kind of speaks to,
you know, some of the research that was
[SPEAKER_09]: put out in 14 by the Israelis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, a lot of us old time
cultivators have said forever that,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, is why sungrown cannabis is a
superior therapeutic agent because you
[SPEAKER_09]: have more of the minor cannibinoids,
you have more terpenes, more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_09]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, you know, this is,
this is the wine and weed, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, comparison.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want, you know, more flavor
sophistication and more layers there or
[SPEAKER_09]: less?
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, yeah, I think that makes a lot of
sense, Gary.
[SPEAKER_09]: You also hit on a little nugget there
about, uh, kind of a thermal equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's a lot of talk and
vaporization about the superiority of
[SPEAKER_09]: convection over conduction.
[SPEAKER_09]: From my experience in the way that we
vaporize, I've always found that really
[SPEAKER_09]: the magic is when you reach that thermal
equilibrium, the important thing from my
[SPEAKER_09]: experience has been the materials.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in other words, if your materials are
glass or quartz, uh, especially,
[SPEAKER_09]: and your convective airflow heats those
materials up to where they reach that
[SPEAKER_09]: thermal equilibrium, that's where I find
you get the best, uh, most rapid full
[SPEAKER_09]: spectrum extractions, enabling the most
rapid full spectrum deliveries.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to speak to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's something that has very much to
do what you just mentioned, Gary,
[SPEAKER_06]: although we never use the oil itself to
vaporize the herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: When, um, surf rack glass, Brian came up
with his brother with that, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: the, the one that, uh, Mark has now,
um, innovated on and continues to push.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just weren't really producing it like
a product, but it was the OG hot glass,
[SPEAKER_06]: like a little handle with this hot glass
that you held into a bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we would put some Renee herb in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at one point I was hitting a lot of
full melt Renee bubble hash and on a
[SPEAKER_06]: screen, but I would kind of use a match
to, to, so it was just bubbling and never
[SPEAKER_06]: really completely burning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and I always wanted to combine the
two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I asked Brian if he could make
something that would combine the two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he came up with this pipe that was
basically two pipes melted together and
[SPEAKER_06]: they go, and they were separate all the
way up to the mouthpiece where the two
[SPEAKER_06]: bong stems would spin and create one
mouthpiece just at the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would inhale one side of the vapor
from the herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the other side, I would put a
little full melt, like 73 micron Renee
[SPEAKER_06]: bubble hash, and I would hit that with the
match.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would see the smoke kind of go up,
but it was really more like a vapor smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a harsh burnt smoke,
you know, like almost like a dab prior to
[SPEAKER_06]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the vapor would go up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when those two joined right at your
mouth, I swear to God, you could taste
[SPEAKER_06]: their separations in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they were joining in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to me, to this day, that is pretty
much one of the most incredible rips I've
[SPEAKER_06]: ever had.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anyone wants to come up with a pipe
that is a dab rig, but also fits one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the VRIP hot glass wands, uh, that you
should do that because people don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, that was like 12 years
ago and people do not know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it would be some type of a,
a, an email for, for dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it could be, it could be this
type of unit as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you just, how to make it so you could
do both at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Marcus, have you tried dabbing off a
silicon nitride?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not unless you've sent me one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, take a look at what Linus has.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been following this product for two
and a half years, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's, it's a different,
uh, it's a, it's a different ball feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, ballpark when it comes to dabbing
Linus showing the VB 2.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the 2.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say I have the Omicron for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a silicon nitride.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it, you know, I was looking at
this as silicon carbide, your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, this thing, we, we put silicon
nitride in there because it was the
[SPEAKER_02]: ceramic surface that could get extremely
hot very fast and not break because
[SPEAKER_02]: ceramic and glass at really high
temperatures, if there's a big thermal
[SPEAKER_02]: gradient, like the edges are very cold
because they're being held in the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: is very hot because that's the heating
element.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that just rips ceramic apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So silicon nitride, um, it comes from kind
of the industry, uh, the heating elements
[SPEAKER_02]: that heat the, that light the gas on fire
in your oven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a heating element.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ceramic that gets red hot in a few
seconds and let's lights the gas on fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use the same material because it's
ceramic and we only want to dab on,
[SPEAKER_02]: on ceramic at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our, I mean, it's kind of the easy
way to ensure the taste will be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, this unit gets up to 800
degree maximum in 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right here while I'm holding it,
it's going to tell me it's ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, the vapor is really good because
it's a slightly textured surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's doing what,
um, what the, our email for, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot your name, email, uh,
task task.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, was talking about maybe on a tiny
scale, the roughness in the surface of the
[SPEAKER_02]: silicon nitride, it does seem to vaporize
quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running, um, quite high temperatures
in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's a whole thing on
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, kind of so hot that the, the material
doesn't actually, the dabs don't actually
[SPEAKER_02]: touch the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they bounce and evaporate in the air
and you get the entire hit in within a
[SPEAKER_02]: second.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very quick way to vaporize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's a tiny little dot of,
of, um, dabs, it'll, it'll go completely
[SPEAKER_02]: and evaporate.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I was going to say you can't be
dabbing that with the lid off.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it, if it vaporizes in less than a
second, you must have put it right through
[SPEAKER_06]: the hole in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it keeps it mostly contained.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our first models really kept the vapor
contained because I'm, I'm big into not
[SPEAKER_02]: letting it go into big spaces and learning
from the dabbing guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when we made this emails were coming
out with those domes and those,
[SPEAKER_02]: even with the domeless nails, they're
keeping the dab smoke within a very small
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is actually quite, quite big,
but, um, when this started, we were still
[SPEAKER_02]: doing bubble hash and actual hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the right volume to keep the,
keep the vapor contained.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this whole is where you dab through
and it's the intake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those double duty.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason, the only reason I brought
up the VB 2.5 Marcus, as you were telling
[SPEAKER_01]: me, uh, as you were saying, the future of
vaporization.
[SPEAKER_01]: See with what they're doing, it's
something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing silicon nitride.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a silicon carbide and what the
industry standard is right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: quartz and before quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, the hive ceramics and before
that it was the titaniums and before that
[SPEAKER_01]: it was the, the, the hot knives and before
that it was stones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we have, you know,
we haven't gone through, uh, the full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum materials available, uh,
what we can actually do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now what the industry is looking
at is quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I think we, uh, we have a long way
to go before we can actually make the
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it is the nail, whether it's an
email, whether it's a handheld portable
[SPEAKER_01]: desktop or whatever, there's a long way to
go before we even come to the perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I think that, uh, quartz is going
to be the preferred material for a long
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me tell you why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that glass is, uh, always,
you know, been the ideal thing for the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they started with metal pipes,
they moved to glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see a noticeable difference moving
from a metal pipe to a glass pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then, you know, it's just kind of
the same thing happening through the
[SPEAKER_04]: dabbing culture now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you found a material of glass,
the quartz that can withstand the thermal
[SPEAKER_04]: shock that the process dabbing undergoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, so you get that glass flavor,
um, and it, it's, it's a hard material to
[SPEAKER_04]: beat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the reason why it's not kind of
favorable to, to these vaporization
[SPEAKER_04]: electronic, uh, production scenarios is
because it's just got such a low or such a
[SPEAKER_04]: different thermal expansion rate than all
these other materials.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you try and, you try and put it with
something like a heating element where
[SPEAKER_04]: you, uh, like even consumers will wrap an
email coil around a banger to try and
[SPEAKER_04]: make, you know, a quartz, uh, email
banger, but it'll end up breaking their
[SPEAKER_04]: banger because the, the coil expands and
then it shifts a little bit while they're
[SPEAKER_04]: using it and it's not on the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when it cools down, it's now
pinching the glass and, and it breaks it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so quartz is not a very friendly
material to, to manufacture with when
[SPEAKER_04]: you're trying to turn it into a heating
element.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, all that being said, you know,
with, with the community, uh, where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: at right now, I don't think that any of
these other materials might be great and
[SPEAKER_04]: they might be suitable, but I don't see
any of them, uh, surpassing quartz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and we were talking about silicon
nitride, you know, I have concerns about
[SPEAKER_04]: silicon nitride.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess it depends on the
application that it's going to be used in,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I mean, even on the Wikipedia page
that I pulled up right here, it says main
[SPEAKER_04]: hazards when heated decomposition,
silicon nitride may emit toxic fumes of
[SPEAKER_04]: ammonia and ozone, uh, contact with acids
may generate flammable hydrogen gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, we got to kind of be careful which
materials we're touting as, as being
[SPEAKER_04]: superior.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I mean, if, if someone's making a nail
out of this, and someone comes along and
[SPEAKER_04]: hits it with a hydrogen torch or even a
map gas torch, or even if a glass blower
[SPEAKER_04]: decides they're going to use their glass
torch to heat it up, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: a product issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so I, I usually feel comfortable
if we're just a fraction of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: the decomposition temperature,
did they name what it was?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, right here, it says that the,
it says that the melting point is 1900
[SPEAKER_04]: Celsius, which is extremely hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that is probably not taking into
consideration, uh, that the stuff that's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be going onto it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, like if you're burning contaminants on
the surface, that could make it decompose
[SPEAKER_04]: at exceedingly lower temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think quartz is a perfect material.
[SPEAKER_02]: The silicon, uh, uh, carbide that Gary's
using in the Uptek, I see as necessary
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's a very porous and bumpy
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole point of these, these,
uh, little dab pens is to kind of suck the
[SPEAKER_02]: oil up into the coil, uh, by wicking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oil will wick up a surface that is
rough really easily and fast, and that
[SPEAKER_02]: will keep the coil nice and, and moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and then the coil won't get hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If when we threw quartz into the bottom,
and Gary has done it too, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people swear by it, when you put quartz as
the core of the heating element,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, it's slick and it doesn't wick the
oil so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, actually not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to often with a quartz,
um, uh, pipe, you have to like do this to
[SPEAKER_02]: it to get the oil to actually flow onto
the heater.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I get what I think is a harsh,
sharp, overheated hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe it's because quartz on its
own can't be a wick so well as much as
[SPEAKER_02]: silicone, uh, carbide can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, I think that we, I mean,
I think we should all test this,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if we helped each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should pay for the testing for a lot of
these materials directly and come up with
[SPEAKER_02]: what could be a meaningful test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we, all of us are, are pretty much
in the safe zone when we're at just a
[SPEAKER_02]: fraction, like a third of the temperature
needed to like break the material down or
[SPEAKER_02]: melt it, or to even make it move or to
make it, uh, short life.
[SPEAKER_02]: With Gary, I know with uptech,
he's concerned about these things lasting
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of goes hand in hand that when
you make a product and you figure out how
[SPEAKER_02]: to make it last a long time, that's
usually figuring out how to make it break
[SPEAKER_02]: down even a little bit, um, during normal
use, or even a lot of use.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things should be made for heavy
dabbers to use them forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they shouldn't fail on them or else we
keep, you know, we keep working on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me clarify.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was definitely kind of speaking about
materials that are going to be hit an open
[SPEAKER_04]: flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's kind of where my,
my product specialty is right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: as we've moved away from, uh, electronic
assemblies and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we felt we're kind of more of a
material science on focus on that over
[SPEAKER_04]: here now with between the materials and
our main thing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about flame because I would
see you as an electronics guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's funny because, uh, we've been
playing around with flame because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of, um, new to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we've been around electronics so
much, and sometimes it's fun to hear the
[SPEAKER_02]: sound of a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, the point of your email and
all of our products is you can't hear
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizing happening in the next room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of nice sometimes when you
don't want the whole house to know about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: These materials guys, you know,
we'll be, I think the future will hold the
[SPEAKER_09]: development of the materials to where we
find that they're truly our best of all
[SPEAKER_09]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_09]: If anyone's dove into the technical
ceramic space, they're doing all kinds of
[SPEAKER_09]: crazy things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, combining quartz dust with various
ceramic components, you're creating quartz
[SPEAKER_09]: ceramics.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're absolutely happy in middle ground
that, uh, that, uh, I think we will get
to.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a matter of pushing the material
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I understand about that,
Mark, but what, what task was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what we got the mix up is a
task, uh, was talking about an open flame
[SPEAKER_01]: where you got to heat it up to a high
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when it, uh, that could break it
down, but what Linus and the vapor
[SPEAKER_01]: brothers are doing with that silicon
nitride is it's, it's a controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature where it doesn't reach,
you know, 2000 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he, what, what he explained was,
uh, and that's the thing I love about the
[SPEAKER_01]: V the VB 2.5 is, is it doesn't vaporize on
the heating element.
[SPEAKER_01]: It vaporized like maybe what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: A half a millimeter, you said above it
right in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, uh, this is the heating element,
but that helps us to not have such a hot
[SPEAKER_02]: heating element.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you separate the heat element in space
between the heat element and what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizing, you have to deal with a very
high temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like what task was talking about
with he's, he, you need a really good
[SPEAKER_02]: heater, um, to heat an email because
there's a little distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it needs to run at a very high
temperature so that the email can run at
[SPEAKER_02]: the temperature you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but as you, as you mentioned,
it's a fraction of a millimeter,
[SPEAKER_02]: the distance between the heating surface
and the dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm, I'm, I'm, so that's a very small
distance, but at least the dabs aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: settling down into the heater and,
and, and settling down into the material
[SPEAKER_02]: and then turning black and smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're evaporating theoretically
in the air right above.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same effect as when you turn a
skillet on your oven up so high that when
[SPEAKER_02]: you throw water in it, it bounces because
it's being held up by its own evaporating
[SPEAKER_02]: by its own vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that effect, they call it light
light and frost effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need a more catchy name for that,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the light and frost effect is what we
were going for with this device.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's what I was trying to say is
there's, uh, uh, the, right now the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is set on quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what the industry is going
to be set on five years from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's just gonna, it's, it's fluidic
right now because right now we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the perfect answer to any of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because nobody controls how it
happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just people like what they like and
whatever blows up blows up because that's
[SPEAKER_06]: what people like and you hope that what
they like is actually the thing that is
[SPEAKER_06]: actually, you know, better for them more
along the lines of preserving terpene and
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinode profiles rather than,
uh, absolutely destroying them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, because more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just saying, I mean,
I'm obviously a big believer in science
[SPEAKER_03]: and technology and I, I love all the
things that it's done for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, not just for the cannabis consumption
side, but for everything in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, you know, like my good old buddy,
Mark likes to tell me, uh, whole foods are
[SPEAKER_03]: always better than eating, uh,
EAS metrics or any of those meal
[SPEAKER_03]: replacement, um, protein shakes that I
used to scarf down at his place all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, sometimes I always think
back, man, are we over complicating this
[SPEAKER_03]: because the plant in its natural form,
sun grown, it's just so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think bubble man said it best,
you know, if it feels good, if it feels
[SPEAKER_03]: right, then maybe that is the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to get too much into
hippie territory, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, it does feel that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as I started making all these
technical improvements to our device,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and then I just thought about,
you know, the first vaporizer I use the
[SPEAKER_03]: heat gun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really thought, man, the heat gun,
you know, I haven't used it for 10 years,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I do feel like if I used it right now,
I think it would be comparable to a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: the units out on the market still,
you know, so I think there is maybe going
[SPEAKER_03]: back to basics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does seem like the world is kind of
going back to basics again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that is the best way to ingest
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hate to eat and run or not eat and
run, but it's time for me to take my kids
[SPEAKER_03]: to go eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to go run now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate being on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcus, Task, Mark, Gary, Linus,
thank you very much for all of your
[SPEAKER_03]: contributions to the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really feel it is important to give
credit where credit is due.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of you guys have influenced me in
one way or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad that I was able to do the
same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And well, I'll continue watching on my
cell phone while you guys continue
[SPEAKER_03]: educating me.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, Sabo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always good to have Sabo in the house and
sharing his passion.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just one of those guys that he's
ignited with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he's definitely not going to
stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys have a words thing for his
vaporizer now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been hitting it the whole time.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has these little quartz rods that you
fill your concentrate with, and then you
[SPEAKER_06]: just slide it right into the tube of the
piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bomb goes right over top.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, these little quartz rods give,
I mean, they dab deliciously.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one thing I'll tell you about this,
which is crazy, I'll tell you one thing
[SPEAKER_06]: about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I put like a drop of pure cannabis
derived terpenes into this thing with
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing else and turn the unit down,
and drop the quartz rod into the glass
[SPEAKER_06]: tube that's been heating the air up,
just the way it seems to heat is one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the most preserved pure terpene rips I've
ever taken.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've done like 20, 30 in a row,
like done some gauntlets with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually astounding how much it
preserves the rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely hits Sabo.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, really efficient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, it's I mean, I have both my
electric nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a Mr. Hotbox going right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got my Vapix Hail going.
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually have like two or three different
things going that I can that I can rip at
[SPEAKER_06]: a time just because I love a little bit of
variety in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you use torch at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you completely?
[SPEAKER_04]: I use torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a torch right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not it's not show friendly.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's you know what, I have used it
during the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, for a while there, I didn't have
I have a Davenator.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a D nail and Mr. Hotbox.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all just sitting here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use them at different times.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for a while, like maybe a month or
two, I was just torching.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got into torching.
[SPEAKER_06]: I came way late to the torch game.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I definitely am not a fan of like
knocking it over and burning my car seat
[SPEAKER_06]: or burning my friend's arm or all the sort
of like non like the torch etiquette that
[SPEAKER_06]: is the not Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those burns we were talking about it
the other day with a friend the burns that
[SPEAKER_06]: you get on the inside of your arm.
[SPEAKER_06]: They look like like like you're a meth
junkie or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they never go away.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just are there for like years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't hurt right when it's hot
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't feel it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried I tried to fight the torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I tried to do the whole email
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the torch just came back full swing,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at least for me and my market it did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the torch is definitely popular.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I'm a quiver guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm definitely not trying to be all like
anti any particular one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just you know, I might not smoke BHO
or CO2 oils.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, I don't make it my
mission in life to make sure that nobody
[SPEAKER_06]: else does either.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I was a little bit more more like
that when you met me though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
impassioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Marcus, do you time it you set your
timer and you know, you won't let anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: touch it on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone the whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what, that's sort of be
really super new shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually, you just know your nail and
you know how long to hit it for and you
[SPEAKER_06]: know how long it cools the wrist is quite,
you know, you use your wrist to tell how
[SPEAKER_06]: hot it is can also really, for me,
I'm avoiding one thing in one thing alone
[SPEAKER_06]: with a torch, chasing my banger to burn
and blacken my hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also tastes like, ooh, like that's
something completely different from the
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful tasting grip I would have gotten
had I just allowed it to stay in an oil
[SPEAKER_06]: like when I'm when it's still in an oil,
I feel like I've vaporized it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it's chas my banger, and I need
to get the DC glass cleaner out that I
[SPEAKER_04]: feel that it's that I got to get on the
timer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like you say, it's super new shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's super new number one right
over here then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because it's like, you know,
I'm I'm, you know, waiting a minute for a
[SPEAKER_04]: banger to cool down is a long time to
wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get distracted, you know,
I check my phone, I see a notification.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sooner or later, I've missed my
window.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got a timer with with the alarm.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it always goes off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always get it at the right time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's that's really kind of what it's
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more about a discipline than than
being a new no offense or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know none taken.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was using it more like as a as a joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in reality, I don't heat up for for
that long.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have to cool my nail for a minute
because I don't take monster dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I take many, many, many like smaller dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I put a dab on a nail,
it's not cooling the nail down so much
[SPEAKER_06]: that I have to like heat it up real hot
for a minute and bring it down or heat it
[SPEAKER_06]: up for 20 seconds with the torch in order
to bring it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I'm hitting these giant fucking you
know, these things are big.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a bunch of these JP ones and I got
like a I think DC sent me a double XL.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all the ones I have are big.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I become a noob instantly if I hit
someone small little banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need I need the timer immediately with
my own banger.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and these these new ones that we put
out there, they're a little different to
[SPEAKER_04]: the quartz material has a different
thermal properties than traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: quartz.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know, a 20 second heat up would
result in about a 60 second cooldown.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's generally what I see with
some of these larger ones I have now I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: like more like heated for maybe 10
seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just with my wrist, it's you know,
not very long that I wait 25 seconds or
[SPEAKER_06]: something close to 30 seconds and then I'm
have my little dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it definitely doesn't work as good as
having your nail plugged in or having your
[SPEAKER_06]: timer and doing it exactly the same amount
each time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just that's it's all what you choose in
the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys believe in carb caps?
[SPEAKER_02]: You do believe in tight carb caps and
really pulling a vacuum?
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the opportunity to have that I got
these puke and beagle ones that fit into
[SPEAKER_06]: quartz bowls like similar to the one Mr.
Hotbox has it fits very tight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I put my finger on the hole,
there's no pulling through it anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's I like the ability to have
it so I can do that if I want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I definitely don't want to hit my
whole rip like that every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you when we first put out our
first carb cap back in, I think it was in
[SPEAKER_04]: 2012, might have been 2013.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'm bad with dates.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was under the impression that,
you know, the vacuum pressure played a
[SPEAKER_04]: substantial role in the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as I've kind of moved along and grown
to understand it better, I think that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: good to have a good seal so that your carb
caps functioning the way it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: be functioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you don't want air to be coming
around the sides where it's not supposed
[SPEAKER_04]: to be going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a good seal is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think that the vacuum pressure
plays so much into the functionality of it
[SPEAKER_04]: as much as just having a constant flow of
new air to mix into the oil and having the
[SPEAKER_04]: air thin the oil out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by thinning the puddle out,
it vaporizes easily because the depth of
[SPEAKER_04]: the puddle is less.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you have a deeper puddle,
it's under more surface pressure at the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom and it requires more energy to,
you know, to create nucleating or boiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by thinning out the oil,
it allows it to vaporize.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's where my personal
understanding of it is at right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I may be wrong, but I don't think that
the vacuum effect of the carb cap has too
[SPEAKER_04]: much to play in the functionality of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what Mark McCoy has a lot of deep
understanding of certain physics here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have an opinion on, do you think
that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually put quite a bit of effort into
this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So last winter, the state of the art
dabbing gear kind of came late to the game
[SPEAKER_09]: as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played with torches.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that there is something to be said
about the thermal gradient in your timing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's one thing that, you know,
you don't have with the emails at the
[SPEAKER_09]: present.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I think you may see some of that
stuff in the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I've found is it's kind of a
combination.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the vacuum and it's the cyclonic flow
of some carb caps that, like Tass said,
[SPEAKER_09]: spreads it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like when we're vaporizing
flowers, you want to grind them up so you
[SPEAKER_09]: have that surface area.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want to grind it up so fine so
that it cakes together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And interferes with the air flow.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you want to grind it up fine enough
that you really are exposing your full
[SPEAKER_09]: bowl, all those particles to that nice
convective flow and eventually that
[SPEAKER_09]: thermal equilibrium when it's reached in
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's a combination.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's both the vacuum and the air flow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I've found is the cyclonic flow
that spins the oil around in there is the
[SPEAKER_09]: most effective in terms of being able to
go to get a nice fulfilling thick
[SPEAKER_09]: condensed vapor, but at the lowest temp
possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're minimizing the denaturalization
of the important components.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, really important with the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the terpenes, these are
solvents.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to vaporize really quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're very volatile.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want that full spectrum,
you want to be at the lowest temperature
[SPEAKER_09]: you can possibly be at.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I find the cyclonic vacuum is the way
to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got turned on to that actually as a
pursuit because we have had some customers
[SPEAKER_09]: use our heat wands as a heated cyclonic
vacuum.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're just blown away that they were
dropping their heat wand as a carb cap
[SPEAKER_09]: down on a banger and able to go even lower
temp because they're getting vacuum that's
[SPEAKER_09]: spinning the oil around that's already
heated.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of course that vacuum is coming
from the air spinning around the hot glass
[SPEAKER_09]: element of our wand.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we've been playing with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a couple of products in the R&D
pipe that would allow people to go this
[SPEAKER_09]: route if they already had a wand and also
a carb cap design that would really help
[SPEAKER_09]: maximize this based upon the same flow
form physics we have in our vaporization
[SPEAKER_09]: heat wand.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminds me, I had invited Enrico today
from the sublimator company.
[SPEAKER_06]: He also kind of is tuned into the venturi
effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that I came up with
why his thing is so ridiculous is because
[SPEAKER_06]: it does give just an insane... I don't
mean ridiculous in a bad way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was one of the tastiest rips
the first time I ever hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just kind of blew me away actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't really believe it because it
just was such a big crazy looking thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, holy shit, I'm going to
burn my house down with this thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, no, no, it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hit it and was immediately blown
away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I started hitting it when I
wasn't getting the heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I was noticing was you can't take
the heat wand and put it on the bowl and
[SPEAKER_06]: have a rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: His bowl was like this big like titanium
bowl that you needed to heat up with the
[SPEAKER_06]: wand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was the same idea when they were
both heated up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I spoke about this with the Hotbox
guys recently who have this little... This
[SPEAKER_06]: is an electric nail vaporizer that you put
the coil over top of here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It basically goes like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they have a little heated pan
here, a little screen that fits right into
[SPEAKER_06]: here and it sits on your pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: It screws into like the base electric
nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing actually fucking works really
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told him right away, I said,
you know, if you keep this warm inside the
[SPEAKER_06]: thing before we hit it, I bet you it gives
a way better rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was like, oh yeah, we figured that
out right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's definitely something important
to be said about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you're coming up with these
designs, if you're an innovator listening
[SPEAKER_06]: to the guys on the panel right now,
and you're trying to come up with these
[SPEAKER_06]: unique designs, at least for vaporizing
that, you know, you can't just bring a
[SPEAKER_06]: component that's totally cold into the mix
or even on a smallest level, it really
[SPEAKER_06]: affects the temperature of the surface
that you're dabbing off of or using to
[SPEAKER_06]: vape off of.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that in turn, you know, affects
everything in the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might just miss that magic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't understand all of the things,
you know, to the level that Task and Mark
[SPEAKER_06]: and the guys on the panel are talking
about, but I definitely get a good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm glad there's people that are this
passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Paying extra attention to the those very
subtle things to, you know, create the
[SPEAKER_06]: nuances that make a great product,
great.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't have a symphony with just the
base.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, a quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you were talking about the Venturi
effect and all that, have you ever come
[SPEAKER_01]: across the notion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, have you ever thought about that the
less oxygen produces more vapor?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I think that's another
component that's important to consider the
[SPEAKER_09]: vacuum consideration.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you look at our water pipes,
you know, we have we, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: back in the day when we started our water
pipes and bongs were, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: a bit controversial.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, still to this day, some of my
family members will jokingly ask me if I
[SPEAKER_09]: still have that high tech bong company.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny, because people would say,
oh, that's high tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: My family asked me, am I still smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, I'm vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to work on something.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at our vaporization water tool
design, I used ice catches, not just
[SPEAKER_09]: because I like the option of running ice
through the whole tube, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: it really reduces the air volume in there
so that once you're pulling that vapor
[SPEAKER_09]: through there, it's it's really minimized
any oxidation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the vapor is more it's it's it
seems to be more active.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to be, you know, a racy sativa is
a little more racier.
[SPEAKER_09]: A real heavy Indica is a little less
heavy.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, if it's late at night,
you know, I'll often intentionally mix
[SPEAKER_09]: some air with the vapor I'm pulling off
the off the tube or even not run as much
[SPEAKER_09]: ice because I want a little oxidation to
create a heavier effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, there's absolutely something to
that, Gary.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah, because we came to that
conclusion when we were designing the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hercules that we made the air path so
tight that you had to mouth to lung it
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of going straight to lung.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the vapor production that the vapor
that it produced compared to, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: a open coil design and depends where it
was totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about the Venturi effect that you're
talking about, that does play that does
[SPEAKER_01]: have a role in vaporization itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually adds how do I put this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It adds to the effect of how much vapor it
creates, the quality of the vapor and how
[SPEAKER_01]: fast it actually enter how fast it
actually gets into a person's lung.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where how do I put this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not that I'm not the best articulate
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can visualize it in my brain,
but whatever you're doing and whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about is actually what needs to
happen in vapor, what needs to happen in
[SPEAKER_01]: portable vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the direction I think we're
going right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a huge difference the flow form
physics makes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, to me, it's still kind of
dumbfounding that open source math that's
[SPEAKER_09]: been around since the 17th century is
largely ignored in this industry or it's
[SPEAKER_09]: just accidental when it factors in.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, you know, I studied medical
aromatherapy long before I got into
[SPEAKER_09]: vaporizing cannabis, and I really felt the
terpenes, the symphony was ultimately
[SPEAKER_09]: going to be more of the magic because
cannabinoids would be sort of commercial
[SPEAKER_09]: commodities.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can only create these
sophisticated terpene profiles,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, by growing the particular
cultivar in the particular appellation,
[SPEAKER_09]: a particular vintage.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so always wanted to preserve those
besides just sort of being a flavor,
[SPEAKER_09]: flavor snob, I guess, by nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so with cannabis, of course,
those terpenes go at such a lower
[SPEAKER_09]: temperature than the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to have any chance at
getting the full spectrum vapor,
[SPEAKER_09]: the cannabinoids and the terpenes in the
same inhalations, like you do off those
[SPEAKER_09]: first couple pulls of a properly rolled
cone, or a proper, you know, low temp,
[SPEAKER_09]: just waifed in the wood match across the
top of a V bowl bong rip, you really had
[SPEAKER_09]: to have a small sample size and find a way
to extract fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for me, it was, yeah, Bernoulli's
principle and the Venturi effect,
[SPEAKER_09]: which as I stated earlier, I was actually
studying for a shower aromatherapy
[SPEAKER_09]: apparatus.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I woke up in the middle of the night
and just realized, duh, gas mechanics,
[SPEAKER_09]: fluid mechanics, same principles.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the key to getting the best vape.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was where the design concept came
for our chamber bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: Still working with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Venturi effect, what we're trying
to achieve, when we came to the conclusion
[SPEAKER_01]: that the Venturi effect was with itself,
it was called Cyclone Tech for us when we
[SPEAKER_01]: tried to do the herb cartridge for the
vaporizers where you don't have to stir it
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore because at that time in 2012,
you had to literally stir the herbs inside
[SPEAKER_01]: the personal portable vaporizers where we
introduced, well, we didn't introduce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were working on the Cyclone Tech where
the air would circulate around in the herb
[SPEAKER_01]: itself before being extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the vapor being extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, I can't hear anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry about that, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was muted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think this is where you're splitting
hairs, but it's these hairs being split
[SPEAKER_09]: that are the difference between a good
vape and an exceptional vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but too bad we weren't not able to
perfect the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is something that needs to be
looked at again because like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Venturi effect, what actually people
are doing with the carb caps right now is
[SPEAKER_01]: they're spinning it to create the Venturi
effect inside the quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just coming to light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long that's been being
done, but I have begun to notice that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you go back to, how do I put this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what we need to do in order to
make the vaporizers, either whether it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: desktop or a portable perfect,
we have to look at the mathematics and
[SPEAKER_01]: what was discovered hundreds of years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: You look at the old hookahs, you know,
as the article that we started this
[SPEAKER_09]: discussion with, you know, sort of the
first ancient vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got their charcoal holder that is
larger than where you actually pack your
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis or your tobacco or your hashish
or whatever matrix you're vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that air that's sucked past that
charcoal is getting heated.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's being accelerated by Venturi
through your substrate that you're
[SPEAKER_09]: actually looking to vaporize or really in
the case of hookahs, hybrid vapor smoking.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I mean, it's really nothing new.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same way nature works.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at the way waves are created
in nature and wind gets funneled through
[SPEAKER_09]: the forest, I think that's, you know,
for me, that was always where the
[SPEAKER_09]: inspiration came from, the physics of
nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're absolutely onto it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Love to huddle up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fairly versed in the Venturi effect
and Brunelis principle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask a question real quick,
because I'm trying to catch up to speed
[SPEAKER_04]: with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm familiar with the Venturi
effect, but I'm not familiar with how
[SPEAKER_04]: you're applying it in your devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you putting your material like at the
choke point before or after?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, where are you putting it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in our device, we have a bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's literally below an intake that
opens up wider.
[SPEAKER_09]: So your hot air that's your convective hot
air source is being accelerated and
[SPEAKER_09]: condensed by Venturi.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's reaching its point of maximum
velocity and maximum pressure right as it
[SPEAKER_09]: goes through your substrate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for me, that was the magic,
especially with raw herb.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you've got such a broad
temperature range across which the
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes and the cannabinoids release.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to be able to have terpenes
and cannabinoids in the same inhalation,
[SPEAKER_09]: which I do, I prefer it that way,
you really have to find a way to make your
[SPEAKER_09]: extraction as efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was that's what the that's what
the Venturi effect does for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you taking advantage of the low
pressure that happens at that moment to
[SPEAKER_02]: draw it out of the herbs more?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a noticeable difference in
pressure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's the flow form and the
pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't take advantage of Venturi on
purpose, at least in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did definitely this little ceramic
injection molded piece is made a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit asymmetrical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's meant to create a spin if there
wasn't a spin already.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that air goes every which way
super fast, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we wanted to make sure that the whole
bowl vaporizes, not just the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's mostly what we were going
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actual a real Venturi I've only seen
in in your vaporizer so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's the Venturi of pipes that
I've seen the handheld pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a vaporizer, but the pipe itself
creates the Venturi effect where it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't tried it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that's another one that's out
there currently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Mark, let me ask you a question real
quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you said that you believe that the
vacuum comes into play, and I used to
[SPEAKER_04]: think the same thing, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you just elaborate on?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, absolutely, especially to
put it into terms that you're probably
[SPEAKER_09]: most familiar with.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, as I said last winter, when I sort
of have more downtime for R&D and playing
[SPEAKER_09]: with things on the benchtop, I really
said, hey, I'm going to I'm going to
[SPEAKER_09]: figure out this dabbing game and test all
the different state of the art devices.
[SPEAKER_09]: I played with a number of the different
American made coils.
[SPEAKER_09]: I found that my preference I like just
wrapping a coil coil around a glass or a
[SPEAKER_09]: quartz banger because of the simplicity.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like you said, there are corks there
for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the day, the carb cap was
everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: It determined how low of a temp I could
vaporize my my rosin or my my cryoethanol.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could go literally to temperatures just
above what I vaporize flowers at if I have
[SPEAKER_09]: a strong cyclonic vacuum.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm both spinning the oil around in
there like you were touching on earlier to
[SPEAKER_09]: maximize the surface area exposure to the
heat.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm creating vacuum, which of course
lowers the boiling point in the
[SPEAKER_09]: temperature at which the phase transition
takes place.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, you know, in order to
create that vacuum, you have to create
[SPEAKER_04]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's it's kind of like a give or take.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have a really dragged hit
then if you're getting that suction vacuum
[SPEAKER_04]: that you want or you're going to have a
nice, you know, kind of free flowing hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's just going to It's about
the balance.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, so many people came
from the bong ripping of flowers world
[SPEAKER_09]: where the idea was, I want to snap it
through so fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need the least amount of resistance.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, hey, I get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what some people prefer.
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the day, for vaporizing,
you actually want a paste draw anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, if you want the cleanest
full spectrum vapor, you want your
[SPEAKER_09]: medicine to go the farthest, the least
amount of it being denatured and and
[SPEAKER_09]: damaged in the process.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you have to find ways to make
lower temp efficient and functional.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's no lower way than there's no
better way than vacuum and flow form to
[SPEAKER_04]: add on to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that also regulating, you know,
like how I spoke of volume and depth,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, regulating your puddle depth
goes into play, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone's going to throw a gram into
one of my bangers, it's not going to cook
[SPEAKER_04]: as efficiently if they would have loaded
in in 10 stages of point one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's that's the beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's why bubble prefers
doing the small taster dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, especially if you have access to
high quality materials to vaporize,
[SPEAKER_09]: you don't need to, as they say,
wasted to taste it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, if you I've got a rosin
that I pressed out last year, virgin flour
[SPEAKER_09]: rosin was seven point seven five percent
turps.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've seen guys with rosins as high
as nine percent turps.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have if you've got that kind of
flavor, you don't need a half a gram in
[SPEAKER_09]: your bucket.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes more sense to take little tasters
and get that full symphony effect anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a whole bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how much vacuum pressure has
to be created to lower the boiling point
[SPEAKER_04]: just a single degree?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what that metric is,
but you can look it up on Google there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's there's there's curves that give
you an idea of where the boiling point
[SPEAKER_09]: goes based upon the pressure for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's different with all materials,
like with water, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: different than it will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just wondering if you knew by
chance.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the terpene profile, of course,
makes it unique and specific to every
[SPEAKER_09]: single material you're putting in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tried to measure pressures in
different places for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted the vaporizer to know if it was
being drawn from and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: adjust its temperature, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just ordinary pressure sensors could
not tell that little difference at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's a small change.
[SPEAKER_09]: The human sensor reigns supreme.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, I'm telling you, the human
sensor reigns supreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me, I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this particular world, though,
I've seen the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if it's just a paying
more attention or if there's something to
[SPEAKER_06]: be said for the the olfactory of
particular people who happen to be the
[SPEAKER_06]: innovators in these different aspects of
industry that are just almost like the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis sommelier, where they're just
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their nose is smelling things a little bit
deeper than someone who's just like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, I'm often amazed when someone
pulls their bud out of a bag and it stinks
[SPEAKER_06]: like mold.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, oh, and they'll be like,
what?
What?
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's musk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, no, bro, that's like mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it's that's not terroir.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right there on the bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, that's not terroir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so I think that there's something to
be said for that bio assay, the importance
[SPEAKER_06]: of trying something for your own head and
making those decisions, which I'm sure
[SPEAKER_06]: would be a good place to start task in
regards to trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_06]: vacuum works best just through the bio
assay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I I have like one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven different
[SPEAKER_06]: carb caps here, and I use them all at
different times.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on kind of what kind of a rip
I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if I'm looking for that high anxiety,
like sitting on the edge of my chair,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on the brink of highness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm going to use my really serious
vacuum carb cap, the one that has like no
[SPEAKER_06]: airflow almost at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just like that seems to when I
exhale a heavy duty rip of the where's my
[SPEAKER_06]: bike longer flowering, clean, rich rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just is quite different from if I'm
looking to hit something a little lighter
[SPEAKER_06]: like the Juanita, La Grimosa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very orange flavory, you know,
kind of like a dessert more than a heavy,
[SPEAKER_06]: heavy rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to hit this one because it's so
flavorful and I don't have to turn the
[SPEAKER_06]: vacuum on full.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just hit it really like boom,
like a big blast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still when I smoke this hit anything
else out of my pipe until I clean the pipe
[SPEAKER_06]: because everything will taste right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it just kind of boils down to
personal preference with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some people are going to like
one thing, others are going to like
[SPEAKER_04]: another.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally, like I said, I've kind of
come to the conclusion that I think the
[SPEAKER_04]: vacuum is less a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's more just about having fresh air
to mix in with the oil so that there's
[SPEAKER_04]: molecules available for your oil to,
you know, interact with and keeping that
[SPEAKER_04]: puddle not too deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that those are the biggest
things for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And having a cap that creates a suction,
I end up feeling like I'm fighting the
[SPEAKER_04]: peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my personal preference is just having a
cap that, you know, has a nice flow to it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but can also get the oil swashing around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think a happy middle ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the day, it's about tuning
into not just your preference,
[SPEAKER_09]: but you'll figure it out that each one of
those caps, they create different vacuums.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so therefore you use a different
temperature to get the results you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely like having a cover of caps.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a new cap that we're going to
put out next Friday to you guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could show it to you right now,
but I can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little collabo with Gordo Scientific.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gordo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay on the lookout.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you guys have seen the carb caps
that people were actually putting terpenes
[SPEAKER_06]: into that you were carving with those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure that ever took off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting though.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also the whole concept of just like
having cool air because it cools the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cooling the air before it goes
through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also the Eternal Quartz guys
came up with what they're calling their
[SPEAKER_04]: convection carb caps, where they're made
out of quartz.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll heat the tip of the carb cap and
get it nice and hot so that the air that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're drawing through is hot air.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it helps facilitate the vaporization
process even further there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what some of our guys have been
doing with the heat one.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what really got me looking at
playing with the carb cap and being able
[SPEAKER_09]: to idea of actually having not just vacuum
and flow form component, but a thermal
[SPEAKER_09]: component to the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely something there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about the Trinity.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for having me, but I got to
take off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a family thing I got to get to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't even showered yet today,
so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're just going to wrap it up right
now, Task.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a ton for coming in and chatting
with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll look forward to if you want to
drop like a website and Instagram or
[SPEAKER_06]: something where people can check you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: HighlyEducatedTI.com for our online store.
[SPEAKER_04]: My Instagram is TaskRock, T-A-S-K-R-O-K.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hardly ever post those, so don't get too
excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Instagram for HighlyEducatedTI
.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just HighlyEducatedTI.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Linus from Vapor Brothers, thanks for
joining the conversation and keeping it
[SPEAKER_06]: psychedelic, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciated your perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry to hear that your partner
split because you went corporate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Corporate's just the word.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get more done.
[SPEAKER_02]: When there's responsibility and a lot of
parts, yeah, you can't wing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks so much for coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Gary from Uptech and W9 who helped
organize the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, bro, for being a part of the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to actually, Linus,
real quick, do you want to drop your
[SPEAKER_06]: Instagram and your website as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're VaporBrothers.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell the vaporizer there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the VB2 for a while, but we might
bring it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gary seems very hip to it, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Instagram is at VaporBrothers,
spelled out V-A-P-O-R, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also Linus Larson on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can search for Vapor Brothers on
Facebook, and then I post on there and
[SPEAKER_02]: find me that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good way to message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, one more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a website that we all have been on at
one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called fuckcombustion.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be a manufacturer and hear
people say, what about this material?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I took a hit and it felt burnt.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the things, all the hard questions,
all the arguments, the people are very
[SPEAKER_02]: discerning on that website, fuckcombustion
.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on there as Linus, Vapor Brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can search.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to ask the hard questions,
that's the forum to do it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't be rushed off because it's not
polite or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'm forced to be polite back to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not supposed to say anything bad
about any other company.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that keeps it clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one good place to find me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuckcombustion, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gary from Uptac and W9, give thanks for
helping me put on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to drop your Instagram and
your contact information?
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you having me on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the members on the
panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've given me a lot of insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, Linus, Task, Sabo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you guys coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram is Uptac.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our manufacturer's Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have W9Tech, our retailer's
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our website is w9tech.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the letter W, the number nine,
T-E-C-H.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you can find our Vaporizers
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to point out that last week I did
meet up with Linus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Omicron that he has.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to refurbish his old Omicron.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the Omicron V3.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to give him the V5.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been two generations out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to be receiving one of the
VB2.5 to test out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like he said, we might bring it to
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might be working together on that
project itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody, for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Marcus, for having us on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions, I'm on
Fuckcombustion too.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Linus said, if you can pass
Fuckcombustion's questions, your company
[SPEAKER_01]: is doing all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gary's very precocious.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the word for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Prolific.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very prolific on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has answered all the most tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a lot of heart in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he says, don't inhale off of this,
this, that, and that, and we don't do
[SPEAKER_02]: that, by the way, he means it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really for portables.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the world is really going portable
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Gary has the good chance at taking a
lot of what we've talked about today and
[SPEAKER_02]: reproducing it in a portable way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for a long time, all these years,
I bank on plug-ins, plug-in models,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I get the hit I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reproducing that into a portable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, oil made that easy and possible,
but vapor someday would be cool if there
[SPEAKER_02]: was a good herb vaporizer that was
portable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's subject to future shows and
conversations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I also want to thank Mark McCoy for
coming out and sharing his knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always great to hear from you,
dude, and see you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even my wife walked into the room at one
point to bring me a lovely water,
[SPEAKER_06]: which I have not even had a sip of.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were on the screen and she said,
does he not age?
[SPEAKER_09]: She's too kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for coming out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Many good memories, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get the family up there and
we'll hang out here at some point in the
[SPEAKER_09]: not too distant future.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for putting this on, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome platform bubble.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't thank you enough for the exposure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is a great subject.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's really good for people,
the vapor enthusiasts, enthusiasts of
[SPEAKER_09]: anything, to understand the history of
what it is they're too enthusiastic about,
[SPEAKER_09]: how they got to where they are today,
and the ability to add feedback to help
[SPEAKER_09]: guys like us drive the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: Linus, we've known each other for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sabo, definitely one of my favorite humans
in the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gary, great to meet you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Marcus recently made me aware of you guys
and what you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to collaborate on something.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, our companies are only three letters
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mark, a quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to ask you, are you in Canada as
well?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here in the top of... Super lucky to
have been able to cultivate here in what I
[SPEAKER_09]: consider one of the Champagne regions of
the world for cannabis and for grapes for
[SPEAKER_09]: that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got cut off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in NorCal, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm in NorCal, Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to make my trip up there for the
annual pickup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really need to sit down because I want
to pick your brain about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: research you've done on the Venturi effect
and collaborating on something that we
[SPEAKER_01]: think should be the ultimate portable
device that should come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's session, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to thank Sabo for coming out
with the Team Vape Exhale.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can check him out on Instagram at Team
Vape Exhale.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm bubble man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can check me out right here on YouTube
on bubble man's world and BC bubble man on
[SPEAKER_06]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, just super, super thankful to
have these guys come in and share their
[SPEAKER_06]: information today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all for watching.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had about 700 live viewers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just down to 580 now at the end of
the three hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully the show will get a solid
10,000 views in the next seven days like
[SPEAKER_06]: the last three episodes of Hash Church
2.0.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be in Jamaica next week for Bob
Marley's birthday bash at 56 Hope Road in
[SPEAKER_06]: Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll be hanging out and having a good
time with Skunk Man Sam for a while on the
[SPEAKER_06]: other side of the island.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we'll see you guys next week
on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks, everyone, for being a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: May the full melt bless your bowl sooner
than later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
