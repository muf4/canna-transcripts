moved around I'll just hold it against the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall and then gently pull it out What temp
did you press your rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay Well, we pressed the first batch was
at about 220 then we pressed the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: at about 180 so we had like a 40 degree
difference between the the flower rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: and the dry sift rosin both are incredibly
tasteful.

People can collect them and move on from
[SPEAKER_00]: them and then you know Another person can
come along and collect them and enjoy them
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of the unique things mother
ships really done It's I mean really
[SPEAKER_00]: mother ships put that game back in glass
in the sense it really I've mentioned it
[SPEAKER_00]: on my last Facebook live how I want to
really get into this space this bubble man
[SPEAKER_00]: space opening up a proper space in
Vancouver, you know with a nice high-end
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant and a vapor lounge and a shop
where you can buy all the bubble tools and
[SPEAKER_00]: the dry sifting tools have a demo area
where you can actually make hash and a
[SPEAKER_00]: walk-in freezer have a studio where we can
film have a high-end glass gallery where
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do mothership shows and Japan shows
and Philly shows and Cali shows just I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it would be Yeah, something I'm
fucking stoked to get back into you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was back I was into that in
early 2000 mid 2000s before I closed my
[SPEAKER_00]: gallery that was a big part of what we
were doing I Still have a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So God this shit gets the banger clean
Right there guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets the banger clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Love it Make sure that banger is clean
clean clean You know both sides too
[SPEAKER_00]: because yes stuff gets on the inside stuff
gets on the outside So what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, are you slumping John?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, someone said homie in the back is
slumped You should have seen John with
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah lemon drop mega pot Ryan with the
blue dial and the OFC I took some really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice photos of it with my macro lens today
So I'm gonna post those today in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership room Yeah Ross, that's what I'm
talking about a real high-end restaurant
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're the really beautiful gallery and
all these other aspects where you could go
[SPEAKER_00]: or you could be in the gallery or the
restaurant And you can see on the TV's
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe me and John are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's busting out some sift I'm busting out
some bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're making some rosin I want to
have all my friends be able to come by and
[SPEAKER_00]: use that studio film bring people in and
create a really cool vibe where we also
[SPEAKER_00]: have super high-end glass shows,
so John are you medicated?
[SPEAKER_02]: I am very medicated Here look at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in a Facebook live with us ignore
those idiots I'm just trying to get an
[SPEAKER_02]: appointment until December 27th Oh my
gosh, well, that's you know, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable if you don't do it now,
then it's gonna even be a later wait Let's
[SPEAKER_00]: get some of that cake batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I walk in somewhere actually?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is the cake batter You might be
able to yeah, look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this flour rosin cake batter that
Johnny B And I pressed out earlier with a
[SPEAKER_00]: single press we just pressed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't you can't even bloody see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think I need a little dab of it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god It is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun to make this with you There we
go little dab a doodle Heat this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: May you have a rosin when's the last time
you puffed on flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know I mean I guess in Toronto I
lit that spliff that was the Cuban hash
[SPEAKER_00]: cigar thing but it was mostly like 90%
concentrates dry sift rosin bubble hash
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpenes the whole nine yards,
but there was like a leaf or something
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapped all around it So I guess in a
sense that was kind of like the closest
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come to hitting flowers in a long
time Token daily days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Darren's in the room bong rip mother
lover We are getting down dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting down I'm about to hit this
shit like it owes us money and isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: paying Yeah Darren always adds that one
because you know what it's accurate to add
[SPEAKER_02]: that one dry sift rosin All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna hit the timer real quick again
boom and We got the 52nd timer on mother
[SPEAKER_00]: lubbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I'm about to hit some beautiful
beautiful flour rosin that we made dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift rosin and the dry sift rosin D check
this out shit is Thick this has got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like five four four point five grams or
something Very nice, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B a little dab a do Look at those
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B's eyes are just closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not even opening them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so fucking peeled Yeah,
pretty much John is on the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have pretty much 21 seconds left Yeah,
you know what turp burping that's not true
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think flour rosin is the most turpy
out of all the flow out of all the rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on we tested the flour rosin versus
the dry sift rosin Rosin was the kill
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on 80 80 percent heads dry sift rosin
is more intense Tasting like the flour
[SPEAKER_00]: than the flour rosin is I'm telling you
Most people have just never cleaned dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift up to that level and then run it But
I'm telling you it is by far the most
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking on point
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow so good I'm telling you really that's
just fucking delicious and you guys can
[SPEAKER_00]: see I'll give you a little look into the
into the Thing here nice low temp dab You
[SPEAKER_00]: know we're puddling over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing there's nothing else going
on with straight fucking puddling over
[SPEAKER_00]: here I'll have you know and so that's what
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you want to see your banger
You're definitely like earlier in the puff
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'll tell you guys it's funny I
torched the bowl real clean and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave it to John and we did the timer But
the timer wasn't enough and of course John
[SPEAKER_00]: took this rip and it was the first time
this banger and I've been religiously
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning this banger It was the first time
this banner banger literally got a burnt
[SPEAKER_00]: Like caked not black, but brown for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing nothing but low temp You
know turp hits that are just like super
[SPEAKER_00]: still prevalent in the bowl drippy like
that John hit it Burnt the fucking bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of it and I was like the puff Wednesday
will be funny because you'll see me biting
[SPEAKER_00]: my lip trying not to get upset But being
like, okay, I got the new cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: solution that dark crystal glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it right here I'm gonna fucking just
Patiently clean and John what happened on
[SPEAKER_00]: the third one that I put into the bowl?
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude the whole really it was pretty
amazing how it was to witness how it all
[SPEAKER_02]: happened and stuff like that Like I said,
I'm trying to do this little live chat
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that you I'll be waiting for it at
the update on the phone and all this
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get this all figured out for the
last like hour Hey wood thrush needler
[SPEAKER_00]: just joined us Welcome wood thrush and
rand corp is with us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural Mostly non chlorinated
water Karanja oil process coconut extract
[SPEAKER_00]: process kelp extract and process extract
of sugarcane Those three extracts how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're extracting it and what they're
doing without those three combinations I
[SPEAKER_00]: think is also an important part When the
quartz is really hot and you put it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: q-tip and you drop that in there It's the
water that steams and it's very much like
[SPEAKER_00]: the way the steam from bud and hash is
steaming out the resin from a rosin press
[SPEAKER_00]: this process seems to very much so steam
and create this, you know agitation that
[SPEAKER_00]: carries the the the Dirt rot resin or
whatever away from the glass and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: check out DC glass on his Instagram He's
got a couple of videos where he heats this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff up like he gets it real hot and then
puts glass into it because it doesn't work
[SPEAKER_00]: cold and Basically, he gets this really
really incredible product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the oil dripping and moving away
from the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sold the same Second I saw it hit my
quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway full madness going on outside of my
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my dog's barking There's kids
showing up, but James Patrick trust me
[SPEAKER_00]: baking soda works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like this shit I can honestly say
it works like nothing I have ever seen and
[SPEAKER_00]: how easy it is I don't know if you're
hitting quartz bangers, but if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super inexpensive I'm definitely
giving it a two thumbs up I put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: little vials and carry it around with me
So I'm not gonna be carrying this giant
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle with me each time But there it is
again for those of you that want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a owner of the company This is
just shit that works exactly Rand will
[SPEAKER_00]: contact Mitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made in Canada His name is dark
crystal glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you google dark crystal glass,
you'll be able to link up with him and
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark crystal glass exceptional resin
lifting power safe for acrylic glass and
[SPEAKER_00]: quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sold Hey doesn't matter where you are
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell this shit all over the place
What do I use to press my rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's show them real quick here what
we got set up for pressing rosin Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: so first of all, you're gonna want to get
a decent Air compressor so we got the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dewalt 15 gallon goes up to 200 PSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need that I stick it at about 80
and of course right here on the top of my
[SPEAKER_00]: desk With John's coffee is my rosin press
from Sasquatch Sasquash so got the magnets
[SPEAKER_00]: up here for when When we have the
parchment inside the plates the plates are
[SPEAKER_00]: custom-made bubble man's world plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to soil grown Phil for
Busting that out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to the v2 very very
fun Pneumatic is better by far turp
[SPEAKER_00]: burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your opinion, you know your opinion
but I can tell you that I'm very very very
[SPEAKER_00]: much enjoying my Sasquatch and I would say
the opposite that I have used pneumatics.

different ones and I just love the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the custom plates I love Sasquatch
the soil grown Phil Sal and how he's

[SPEAKER_00]: of innovation or been a part of the timing
that you know Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean shout out to that guy for sure The

of the dust in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it's coming from You got to
keep all your stuff covered up so that way

covered up and you know what just sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: up for like Five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

at it was roughly 9 grams of 9 grams of
[SPEAKER_02]: bud 9.2 grams of bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah 1.9 or 2 grams of 1.8 grams of rosin
so roughly about 20% return That's pretty
