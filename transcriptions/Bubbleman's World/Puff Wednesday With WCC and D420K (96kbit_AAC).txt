[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome to Baller Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with the new Puff Wednesday crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like we've done a couple of Puff
Wednesdays, at least one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did one, yeah, with Johnny B down in
Stanley Park.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now here we are again starting a Puff
Wednesday that we don't know where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to go, but we figured why don't we
just start with a little session.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about a product that got sent
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about what the West Coast
Concentrate crew is up to in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: their solvent-less products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, you know, have a quick little
session, get baked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty fucking beautiful day out
there today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big, big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a cloud in the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should call it a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a cloud in the sky except the
ones that we are going to be exhaling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got, you want to tell us a little
bit about this little beauty piece?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, this rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Canadian glassblower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually out of the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Tank Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check him out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe his handle is at Tank Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a cool little crew of guys over
in East Van.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's East Van Flame Works is their
shop that they're out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was at the Canadian Glass Gathering
up in Bergen, BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess he was showcasing some of his
glass there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in between some of the judging and
stuff, I went over and checked out the
[SPEAKER_01]: glass table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this pomegranate piece just was like
shining in the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beauty, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I thought it was a really nice color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've kind of been looking at a
pomegranate piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have any heavy glass except
for this piece right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, it was a really nice
little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the opal in the front has done really
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he do the drop-down as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: He did.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drop-down wasn't made with the piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually hit him up on Instagram a
few months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was just like, hey, man,
I want to put my D down in there because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a cool little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he custom made me a drop-down,
same color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he actually matched an opal on top of
it just to match the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it was blown with the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The colors match beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say anything bad about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the size at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, give me the 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because it's just a little 10
on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's so unique about it,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally custom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cool little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope he makes some more of them
because I would get a few colors if he
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one I'm not touching,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smoke this one though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to try it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful little piece, tank glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was grown by True Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a really nice job with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tastes crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he showed it to me at first,
it smelled like almost funky, almost like
[SPEAKER_01]: a cheese smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the tank glass with the True
Genetics with the West Coast Concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this stuff definitely smells a
little funky, a little cheesy,
[SPEAKER_03]: but definitely like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost cushy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but what overpowers it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Hindu?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the cheese?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as cheesy actually now as it was
when it first came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was fresh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is still a little bit funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Q-tip for you, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that smells nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I sure don't mind cleaning my
surface because I'm done hitting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proper dab etiquette.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone should write a book on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably in the midst of being
pumped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step one, do not grab the nail to clear
the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put your lips on the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put your lips on the bomb,
don't put them over the bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not your boyfriend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put your lips right in there,
nice and tight, and get it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good fun that we have here on Puff
Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very tasty, very nice little pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ripped really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, for my liking,
I would like to have a nail on there that
[SPEAKER_02]: was a little less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice, secure nail would just be like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and honestly, we could definitely
put it in the actual palm glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just have it in a reducer because I
kind of want to keep it dropped down a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a little bit hard,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The size.
[SPEAKER_01]: The width itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also got the tourists going on here
with the Cory Cotton drop down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rasta drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, great job that you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this pipe won third to third
prize for best glass at the Canada's Cup
[SPEAKER_02]: and High Times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came up and were like, do you want to
enter that pipe?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure enough, people got a puff off of
it to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone got a puff off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Between Tony and myself, he had his
Faberge egg there, so a lot of people were
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, beautiful pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely on point for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, why don't you hit this one or do you
want to also hit the other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hit the torso.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm used to those.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice and close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown to love the torso.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was quite enjoying it, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before it started to smell like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first couple of whiffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, right as you said, I'm sorry,
I smelt the like, oh, now it's gone past
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's due and it's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he's smelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Q-tip pushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check this out, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys from Improv Enhanced Vaping
sent me this little tool called the
[SPEAKER_02]: Dipstick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I saw it on Instagram originally,
and I wasn't quite sure exactly what it
[SPEAKER_02]: was when I received it recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it comes in a nice little kind of
iPhone-style box.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the unit right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly it's a battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sure exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought at first that it was going to be
like a ceramic tip that you would just
[SPEAKER_02]: heat bowls up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like an herb iron or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like an herb iron or, oh, geez,
what are the other names?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Phaidor was the original one,
and now there's a new company called
[SPEAKER_02]: Glowstick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that Glowstick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle Cushman had one, and in fact,
the company told me recently that they
[SPEAKER_02]: were going to be sending me one,
so when I first got this, I almost thought
[SPEAKER_02]: it was that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually something quite
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, it comes with these two little
heads that simply screw onto the top,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality is definitely there, like would
you say, just from the feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot heavier than I expected it to
be, but not like over heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably about the weight of a large
cell phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say it's pretty damn close,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it definitely feels quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like something, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, one of the things I liked
right away was this magnetic top that my
[SPEAKER_02]: 15-year-old son couldn't open,
and I watched him trying to literally pull
[SPEAKER_02]: it apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it does get cell-proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slightly cell-proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely hard to pull this little
cap off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check it out yourself there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did give it a single shot the other
night, but I thought, while we were here,
[SPEAKER_02]: we could potentially put something down on
the glass and see if we could have a few
[SPEAKER_02]: hits out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need anything like a special glass?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're not going to be hitting it
for that long, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just something that will clean easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like a glass surface?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: A dish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have brought a dish because I
have these little glass dishes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a plate would probably be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what you do with it is you hit it
much like a nectar collector.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just push the button, it goes orange,
and then the mouthpiece is literally the
[SPEAKER_02]: other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just show these guys up on the
camera so they can actually see this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the dipstick.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the little piece that screws on,
and it's pretty quality the way it screws
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely feels pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you hold the button down,
you get a nice bright orange coil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a titanium coil wrapped in a
ceramic head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you pull that off, this is the
battery component.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you unscrew that, you get your
battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then this is just a single hole that
goes through the entire unit and comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much like a nectar collector,
you would hit this while igniting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess what it's really like is
it's like an external vape pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I even have one on me right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good folks at Atmos kicked this down
at the...
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a similar unit in the sense that
the coil, this piece, is inside here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what this company did,
they covered it with a ceramic disc.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't really see well right now
because I have a little piece of... It's
[SPEAKER_02]: got a ceramic disc in the bottom,
so you can't even see when it's heating
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a ceramic disc that starts
heating up and boiling the hash and the
[SPEAKER_02]: oil in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot cleaner than whatever metal
some companies have been using from the
[SPEAKER_01]: past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ready for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we'll close this bad boy up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I can find the little head on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is kind of... I'm sure it's around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of shuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, though, Atmos, I believe that
they actually sell just the top keys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have all the components for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess what we should do is take a
little rip with this dipstick.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dipstick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the first time trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I tried it mildly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say this is really my first real shot
at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we can do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems to work pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucked it up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely got a nice tasty hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seemed low temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiniest little bit, but it actually took
it in real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't waste much weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't look like it was too hot of
a hit, which is my problem with most of
[SPEAKER_03]: these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I look at all these things
for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the idea of finding something that
I can fit into my daily life in some way
[SPEAKER_02]: or shape or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm at my office, when I'm at my
house, when I'm with friends, my D-nail is
[SPEAKER_02]: my go-to unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It plugs into my mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got all the variety of nails.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way I love to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to a degree, it's a nice rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to a degree, even with a torch and
banger, I brought a banger collection
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought three quartz bangers,
all different sizes, and one titanium
[SPEAKER_02]: banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured while we were out there in the
world, we could just hit the variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I brought the infinity with just the
little caps so we can hit at least that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you got banger, you're not upset
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured I'd bring some banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quartz ones are from DC Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the titanium one is from D-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real nice piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did nice work on it, so it's a flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It very much looks like that nail right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the hole is on the side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it screws into the base of the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nail is really well done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 14-4, but it's like titanium,
exactly what quartz would look like,
[SPEAKER_02]: but done in all titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a frosted joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it fits right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that they did this with the slits,
because it cools the nail down a little
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps your joint also a little bit
cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they do something the same way,
maybe higher up on the nail, we'll see it
[SPEAKER_01]: soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll definitely help with the cooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thickness of the titanium nail
when I show it to you, and the flatness of
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of the head, it's really the only
titanium nail I haven't been worried about
[SPEAKER_02]: putting directly into my mothership and
then hitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it never gets hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom is so thick and big that I'm
sure you could get it hot if you just held
[SPEAKER_02]: the torch under.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the reasons I use a
drop-down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, motherships are not cheap
bongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea of a metal expanding in your
glass joint is a somewhat sickening
[SPEAKER_02]: thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even losing my drop-down would be a
bummer, but a lot less of a bummer than
[SPEAKER_02]: losing the ship, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a nice day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely was expecting more harsh
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely like the idea of this being
able to almost work through like a bubbler
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're big water guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very big water guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need it on the go on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the top of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm out on a boat, the D-nail's not
working.
[SPEAKER_02]: The battery's not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very nice to have some product that
you can get a nice rip off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the idea of having your rosin
in a small little glass lid that you just
[SPEAKER_02]: open up, flip upside down and go... That's
definitely potential for... We'll see how
[SPEAKER_02]: it does on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be really the true test for me as
a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: How well does it heat up and cool down in
a minus 15 degree temperature?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to just go get a little glass
jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The jars are plastic on the outside and on
the inside it's glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be breaking that glass
while you're out on the mountain,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why, you know, when I brought the
Terps, I bring the... Well, this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: hash that I got from you and this is the
Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some G4.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see what I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Tony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to everyone in the Terp land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's shout out to Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Kay from Trichome Technology
who was really... He was really one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: first people, one of the first people I
saved because Skunkman Sam was the first
[SPEAKER_02]: person to ever talk to me about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That probably goes back about 12 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the first one to show me pure
terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although not derived from cannabis plants,
we were still able to see the modulating
[SPEAKER_02]: effects of those terpenes on cannabinoids
in their pure form.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say, by the way,
that... This gorilla smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try and draw us some cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I blew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one that you were doing on
church, or not church, Periscope the other
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, Jack looks empty, but watch,
as the terpenes condenses back until they
[SPEAKER_02]: start to appear now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we just get stuck on the side glass
or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably... It's raining back,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else we got over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Irene, OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That girl's goat smells phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's definitely on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what that was?
[SPEAKER_02]: G4.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a whiff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a gorilla.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the one you had on church and
you couldn't explain what it smells like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can't explain what it smells like
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, they're all very unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they all are very unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we each take a dab of the one
that you want to take a dab with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hit it with rosin or with bubble,
and we'll just do a quick little dip on
[SPEAKER_02]: whichever one that grabbed you the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do bubble with that gorilla.
[SPEAKER_03]: The G4?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to taste the G4 too, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last one you showed me too was
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a commercial strain, yet it's one
of the headier commercial strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one people in California make
money off of, they grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like their hash plant of the
90s where the majority of people can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually pull off a nice product with this
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of heady people just call it a
commercial strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have to say, I've personally never
smelled turpings that were actually
[SPEAKER_01]: derived from cannabis, and it's definitely
better than I expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first experience I've had with
cannabis-derived turpings.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing it, we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want to put my finger in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, you'll see me when I photograph
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have... I'm like the most careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what you can have?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is if you would like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a glass one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just do the press and dip.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pressing dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've pressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like Christmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an early Christmas present,
definitely for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for a treat, Mr. Alderman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, shout out to anyone who had anything
to do with... With cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: With cannabis fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love being in the middle of this right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a wonderful thing, both of these
guys being the heady kind of guys that
[SPEAKER_02]: they are, hitting the pure turps for them
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like Kay, and people like Spunkman
Sam, and now Tony, and Horatio,
[SPEAKER_02]: and many others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike from Keygon Genetics, and probably 20
or 30 Instagram accounts where people are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to believe and play around with
their microwave distillation, or their
[SPEAKER_02]: steam distillation, or their hydro
diffusion, whatever they have available to
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely neat to see people
exploring and learning more about the
[SPEAKER_02]: differences of a terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to the days where we can
take these profiles and split them into
[SPEAKER_02]: their fractions, and literally be like,
whoa, smell them all at once, and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: see how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I better join you guys on the
call.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did we just try?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the G4?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was the Gorilla Glue with the
full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effect is super heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely top of the forehead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some nice hives, but those
terpenes definitely did something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They changed it up a little, don't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for us, because we get to smoke that
straight all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that full spec, so then we kind of
know, man, yeah, that's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just to stay on the same page as
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad page to do, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got a hit from the hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was definitely one of the more
enjoyable dive experiences I've had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially for full melt, just to be able
to add cannabis or add terpenes is always
[SPEAKER_02]: a blessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just something that not a lot
of people have really experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even pretend to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to learn about the terpenes and
the safety factor of inhaling with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, because I guarantee it will
be certain terpenes that we might not want
[SPEAKER_02]: to be doing this with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there'll be other ones that are just
so clearly something that we want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the taste of it on my lips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes right down your throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a segue that I was actually
going to ask you about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just like being stoned and
thinking about shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distillate versus something that has
terpenes in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that be something potentially that a
dog would not be able to smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the cannabinoids or is it the
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's karyophylline, in fact, that dog dogs
are tested with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the terpene karyophylline,
which is the most prevalent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one that gets out even in bagged
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It escapes the smell of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just saturates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It floats out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It evaporates at below room temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems to have a long-lasting effect
in the sense that certain terpenes can
[SPEAKER_02]: boil up very fast and be gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Karyophylline, although it evaporates out,
it still stays present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one of the main reasons
why they train drug dogs with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, in the near future,
they won't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really a big deal, I guess,
going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a thought I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it's definitely an interesting
thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should pick up this party, head out
into Puff Wednesday, see what characters
[SPEAKER_02]: we bump into out there, and obviously get
them all terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just ended up here downtown.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of in the parking lot next to
the Cirque du Soleil, right behind BC
[SPEAKER_02]: Stadium, BC Place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess these guys have a good little
spot for us to go check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Science World across the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what about a dog session?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dog session?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a dog sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there is a chance that it's
locked, though, hey?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we
[SPEAKER_02]: bother, or should we just go to where you
were going to take us?
[SPEAKER_02]: We will puff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will puff on Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will definitely puff on Puff Wednesday,
taking you to Narnia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Narnia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Narnia in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch out for the syringe and the condom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see that VPD report?
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shadow one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they retracted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I saw Kirk and Dana destroy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they retracted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they retracted it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we can go wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little nook and cranny.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than one right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's looking at us.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm coming down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost feel bad that we're interrupting
your serenity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be short.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we made it to our outdoor spot,
first spot to have a session at.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Granville right there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granville Street Bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really close to Granville Street
Bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right in between Granville Street Bridge
and Science World.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically right beside BC Stadium.
[SPEAKER_02]: BC Blaze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Science World is in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically we're here to smoke a dab,
hit a dab each, and then split to go eat
[SPEAKER_02]: some food.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might eat downtown.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might end up heading over to Commercial
Drive where D420K is at and go have a
[SPEAKER_02]: session with him and go eat some food with
him, depending on what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hitting out of the tank glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sweet day for a day that was
actually considered fairly cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a couple of degrees above zero
right now, maybe five or six.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some warmth in the sun,
isn't there?
[SPEAKER_03]: There is, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little walk-on ferry going by
right now that looks pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comes from Granville Island, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think they all leave from there
and they have a bunch of spots downtown
[SPEAKER_02]: where they pick them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm definitely looking forward to a
dab and then grab some food and see where
[SPEAKER_02]: this Puff Wednesday leads us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yellow Big.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Game off.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of time are you waiting on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would just hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be that hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just poured some on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that fits right on top of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta get one of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another quick rip and we are on our way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to show these guys the little
walk-on ferries that are driving by.
[SPEAKER_02]: They remind me of like a little Popeye the
Sailor Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that rip, Adam or Brett?
[SPEAKER_02]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to our next spot,
boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we have arrived downtown
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go head out to the La
Taqueria.
[SPEAKER_02]: La Taqueria is where we're heading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right across the street from the DC Vapor
Lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark Emery's CCHQ headquarters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: La Taqueria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get real here, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so excited about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to sit?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll sit in here.
Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark will get the...
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's... Do you have the spicy mushroom
quesadilla still?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is that a new one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I'll get a mango and a guava.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a guava.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a guava.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a guava.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legit drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys happy to be at La Taqueria?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: My tummy's about to be happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well order up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's your turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you get?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got frijoles... No, I got ongos con
kale.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chio of mushrooms with some habanero and
some salsa verde.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking stoked, boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quesadilla, what'd you grab?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a beef...
[SPEAKER_02]: Beef, and he got chicken, and I got
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are ready to rock and roll here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A quick eating session, and then we will
continue our Puff Wednesday over at the...
[SPEAKER_02]: At the vapor lounge.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at the CCHQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see all their history that they have
posted on the sides of the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the man's world, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to get up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're here at the CCHQ vapor
lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a room full of people,
so there will be background sounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got them to shut the music off
so we can do a quick little dab session.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the turpians here, and I think
we're going to start having a quick little
[SPEAKER_02]: session here, shall we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do some turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubbling turps or raws in a turp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Raws in a turp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see, Master Scout.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a nice sort of flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost reminds me... I think what I'm
going to do with this is... No.
Close.
There it is.
I'm going to use the Jack.
Oh yeah, smell that.
And then smell that.
That's going to be a nice collab.
So you guys feel free to come up with your
own.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how the sun's just shining on me,
brightening me right up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, looking like I'm glowing.
What's that?
Gold?
It tastes like gold.
Oh yeah, that's my gift, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you do us a favor and blow it out of
your nose?
Yeah?
Are you serious?
That's the banana.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the gold?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gold and gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you do?
Gold and gold?
It tastes just like gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Handing, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want jack?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm trying to go out to the back.
Oh, you did it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess at one point,
we will start to offering down to all any
[SPEAKER_02]: unsuspecting people around us right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that ridiculous?
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did it.
That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an unbelievable combo.
Wow.
Yeah, we did it.
He did it at the same time as you.
Round two.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the best-taste combo ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have to say, it might be the best
piece I ever had, not last year.
No.
No.
I'm saving that and all the jacks just for
my own self.
I'm joking.
Dude, do it.
No way.
I couldn't do it.
And we got more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: For a turp down, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I got the seats here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miles, good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brett.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brett.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be West Coast concentrate
crews that are making all these extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did it to you in Irene OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this should be quite a bit.
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's good when it's still
vaporizing off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taste is unreal on that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't even a huge hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very reasonable size hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, first time you tried it here,
so it does kind of choke you up a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find that the latter hits of it
aren't quite as sharp or... No,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It preserves for longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't go through that high of a
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can bring one to you if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you then a much smaller one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go real small.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go so small that it'll be mostly for
the flavor.
Well, it's good.
That one or that one?
That's what I did, too.
That looks good.
Yeah.
Wow.
I've never tasted anything like that
before.
Wow.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You serve up the hit accordingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take what I get.
I take what I want.
Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and we want to get you up next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to give Anne, I think
Anne's getting the blue.
A small one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, we'll go small just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the sun.
Nice.
Did you like that tech?
[SPEAKER_02]: This definitely gives you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I guarantee you if Miles and
Marcy would lick their lips right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: they would taste the terpenes that they
just had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still there, Anne.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice little thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a super nice line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It matters for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand.
So that's really what we need to do.
That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's slowly but surely catching
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cleanest product you can make with a
slight modulation from a pure extract.
Boom, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science has been stunted for 40 or 50
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's slowly catching on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone in here want to try these pure
extracted terpenes with some bubble hash
[SPEAKER_02]: and flower rosemary?
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not kill everybody here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a small one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a small little baby one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I want a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really matters for a lot of people.
Here, check this out.
It really matters for a lot of people.
In periodicals, it's more active than
anything.
It doesn't get in the stomach.
But there's cannabinoids in here.
So if you get a small, tiny bit of this in
here, then you'll get, like Marcy,
mostly just that flavor.
Rather than what Miles got.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we just created an enjoyable
experience for everyone.
This is going to be very on taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does make it look huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was a very small batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: She blew it out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the flavor.
It's always nice to share with the good
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could ask the lady who did it just to
mix it up for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll want to dab for sure.
Nice.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the original.
So I think this is in good shape.
I think so.
I think it is.
I think so.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can almost taste it from here.
That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you open a bunch of jars,
too, you somehow end up with turps on your
head.
Did you get one?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's phenomenal.
Yeah, I think it's one of my favorite
colors.
All right, I think you can go grab the
ladies that work here, and give them a
little dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to see people are playing around
and learning new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did she say?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I expect them to be here in an instant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're wanting to at least let them
taste like a few dabs of that table,
[SPEAKER_02]: then they might be freaked out.
Or take three, just let them smell them
all over.
Even if they don't hit it, at least they
smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the smell of the turps, because trust
me, you need to smell the turps.
Ah, is that real?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not active.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the flavors of the herb,
with none of the active ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if you know what this is.
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
Narrow-leafed drug cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Rob would want me to say,
so I'm going to say it.
Let's find out.
Definitely got a rip for it.
It's definitely got a rip for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1,700 when the vials pull out.
Wow.
It gets like super-wet in for a few,
and then we have pounds of wort made into
it.
Did you say 700 dollars?
Yeah, for one of these vials.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just pure terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, rose essence is worth 20,000
US dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rose essence is 20,000 dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is cannabis, so people are taking
pounds of herb and then extracting just
[SPEAKER_02]: these terpenes from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It becomes a pretty expensive hobby,
depending on what you're working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very funny tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, next up, the bath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I take your hint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it need to get to the bath?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take the hint, and we'll put music
back to you.
You know what?
She's getting jacked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Mike, you want water?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water?
Sure.
It's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Preserve this.
You're going to have it on your lips for
like 40 minutes.
You want to go forever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for turning the music off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are done now.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can turn the music back on,
and we'll see you guys soon on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so just bumped into D420K on
the drive, and what are we going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: get?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go get deep-fried Mars
bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep-fried Mars bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: This place has got the deep-fried Mars
bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have the deep-fried Mars bars
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, how many have we got?
[SPEAKER_02]: Four?
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three deep-fried Mars bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it on the menu?
[SPEAKER_02]: Desserts, deep-fried Mars bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and some onion rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got you, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep-fried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: The deep-fried Mars bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I need this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this, boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too real?
[SPEAKER_02]: Terps and deep-fried Mars bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terps of desserts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And D, just with the onion rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm going in here, guys.
Here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, look at that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, let's hit some hits
through the freshly cleaned mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only got seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven minutes on the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one do you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what are these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oils?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shatters, I can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: My rosin looks like that at home,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, that's why I told you that's
what it is, because it wouldn't trick you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be pretty dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not tricky on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only cocaine and butane, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zambumba, yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, low temp.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way you like it, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, low temp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: As low as you can go.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you have of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: How low can you go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's going up to 6.8, 10,
but you can have the next hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy that I hit it at like 580 to
6.8.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one you hit over here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if we can finish this Puff Wednesday
off with everyone getting a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: The camera battery light just turned red.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably got two and a half minutes left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breath's in.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shibby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're halfway there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to get this done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you guys are going to do your
Wednesday Puff session at the Vapor Lounge
[SPEAKER_02]: on Davey.
[SPEAKER_02]: West Coast Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: West Coast Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: 7 till 10 on Davey Street at Cannabis
Culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Culture, CCHQ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably you won't see it today because
this video won't be getting posted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, we will be there at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same time, same bad time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same time, same place.
We're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big one for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that he's still got the price tag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get one yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all got one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, now that's what I call a successful
Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, when you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to continue on, but always a
pleasure.
Hey, Adam.
Thanks for having us.
Great to be here.
