[SPEAKER_00]: Day two of, or day one of Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day two or three of hanging out at HQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I missed Spannibus today, I went too
late, couldn't get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came back to HQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: David had the banger, or sorry,
the quartz bowl and the coil, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: the plug from Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of it I'm able to take dabs right
now without my ship blowing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's very appreciative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just hitting some lovely
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little Devil's Fruit, a little of
the No Name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one was yours again, Colt?
[SPEAKER_00]: No Name Monster Dry Shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's tasty and heady.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a little dab over here,
and we're with Phil!
[SPEAKER_00]: Phil's with us too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Phil?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's going good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they found your luggage yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, my luggage is still lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they lost your luggage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the abyss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not my bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of Mark's bubble bags, but that's
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had most of them in the carry-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I was smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well here, let's give you a big
dab, Phil.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say no to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: HQ Dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the owner of the place dabbing
you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing David, we'll call him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Phil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little House of the Great Gardener there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some support here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good sized rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'm going to have one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I gave you one already,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got one, so yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do round two of that Monster Dry Shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you thinking of dry shift right
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: After round two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, round two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that Taurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even walked in the door really.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stopped right at the entrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably have ten friends in the
building right now who don't know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see them in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, he's going for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little carrot and orange and ginger juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite aspects of
coming to HQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't wait too long because it doesn't
last.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the night, can't get the
juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta get the juice early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early bird gets the worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early bird stoner gets the juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, okay, I'm doubling up when you're
good for dry shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cold and so refreshing.
It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people that enjoy cannabis enjoy
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They deserve a quality of a drink like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just a pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, get at least the option of a
live juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Taurus is unbelievable like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but this, this... The resin is
smooth as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannibalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I say, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we're gonna continue with these
shenanigans and we'll catch up with you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we've decided after much puffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Lamont?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to... Just walked in right
into the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, these guys are all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so, what are we gonna do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna make some rosin from some
flowers here, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gonna make rosin with the reverend.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it, the panamese?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're gonna do this panamese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this was really, everyone just
looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, ooh, yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't look like there's much here,
but I've yet to really see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been made yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well, do you need anything,
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need the adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adapter, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get you an adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I have it close or if I
messed up and put it far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have... No, that's not an adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I got a suitcase here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it plugged in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little HQ rosin making.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually never turned this thing on
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the cow pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little ink blotch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how hot I need to actually
get this one yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on if the light's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't see the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I even mean that light, the green
light glowing out of the white box.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that red light is definitely on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so... What are we doing here,
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we squeezing buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna squeeze some of this panamese.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're squeezing panamese buds for dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally milking the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to take a little shot of those
buds before we squeeze them in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's the panamese.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, uber dank.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we'll get rid of this little stem
channel there.
[SPEAKER_00]: David, come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panamese.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing panamese dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had a dab at the panamese?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we got a little dab right there out of
the panamese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a micro one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could probably squeeze a little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you want to collect that first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just hold it up against the edge of
the denail or the dabinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squeezing the rosin out.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually picks up pretty nice,
I find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we got a nice little dab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it doesn't pick up really well
if it's really, really turpy, but then it
[SPEAKER_01]: just wants to stick on the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of snap-pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of push the dabber down and just
pick it up and it works pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you should hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know how the panamese dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's dabbing panamese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high-end ceramic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the sapphire insert especially,
it's even more spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we go buy a pound of the panamese?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should squish some more buds and find
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I squish it again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my brother's been doing it with all
his dries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, you just use the
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, you know, a 25 micron screen is
what I use from the bubble bag set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can turn some low-grade into some
high-grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some B or C-grade into a smoke-full
A-grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into a dab-able product even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I saw that on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw me on Hash Church then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much squeezed most of it out on
that first shot there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens like that sometimes,
eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a nice toque from a little bud.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: More squishing to come.
Yeah, that's a good one right there.
Yeah, that's a good one.
Yeah, that's a good one.
Yeah,
that's a good one.
