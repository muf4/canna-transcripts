[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up guys and gals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Man here with Flav421 who just
stopped by and brought some absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful glass from Cory, one of our
local glass blowers that blows just across
[SPEAKER_02]: the water on the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, yeah, I don't know Flav,
you want to tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_02]: these bad boys?
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is one of his goddess tubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got ready lines and impalmos.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's slime.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing about this is it has a Celtic
knot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of hard to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take photos of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be able to show everything that
you're talking about up close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he took one of the Scott Deppie
courses and it's one of the first Celtic
[SPEAKER_03]: knots that he attempted and it came out
really successfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is another sort of piece that
came out of some of the class he took from
[SPEAKER_03]: Scott.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lot of other inspiration from
other artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: The staircase eyeballs, it's very similar
to a lot of the daily work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stacked rainbow all through.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing about this guy is it's got the
perk underneath.
[SPEAKER_03]: He called it a brain perk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brain perk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smoke will come down the tube and up
through here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I demo it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I would say so, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't be seeing it, but he'll explain
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Bubble Man's going to hit it and the
smoke's going to come down through here
[SPEAKER_03]: and down either eye sockets here through
the joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the eye and down behind where the
mouthpiece is in the back where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: puff it quite beautifully.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when you have some nice mouth
to good stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very unique piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't see the bowl at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost as though you're sensing the
flame on the hash and how it relieves
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke into your throat and it gives you a
bit of heat and you're sort of guiding my
[SPEAKER_02]: hit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That hit real nice though.
[SPEAKER_03]: As it sits up like this, the bowl sits up
above the eye line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real nice small mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you got it on there perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I love about the
mothership piece that Ty recently grabbed
[SPEAKER_02]: from Flav is that when I'm smoking it I
look straight down on the bowl,
[SPEAKER_02]: which a lot of bubble heads love.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a similar piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look right down at the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the distance that he made this up
from the mouthpiece is damn near perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: This head would almost make an incredible
dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually I came here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll quickly go off camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cory makes most of his pieces for the oil
heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the domes that they came with
and then he custom did the hash bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion and the bowl, does the bowl
come off?
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured it would slide off.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I don't know I like to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bowl come off and this down stem
actually is either removable and then if
[SPEAKER_03]: you want something that's maybe a little
more convenient on the go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's not quite as breakable because as
we all know when you're when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: puffing on hitting glass you don't want
your shit to be fucked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I think you should take a hit out
of this one, double you up and then I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: follow you follow up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take some nice photos for all you
guys and gals at home who would like to
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly see the patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to be up close to
appreciate some of the intricacies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well there is something to be said from
puffing on a heady glass I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even this piece here that is really a
production piece I think is mildly heady.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is real heady.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just I mean so I'm gonna show my
friends that are watching along in the
[SPEAKER_02]: chat room.
Alright,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm right behind you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loaded up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't mind hitting it without the
other down stem if I may.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing as we're secure here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's real fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking glass with Fat Flav.
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself used to collect heady glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't for quite a few years but I live
vicariously through Flav and I feel very
[SPEAKER_02]: honored that I get to hit all these
pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but back in the day exactly if I
wanted to hit those pieces I had to own
[SPEAKER_02]: them and nowadays there's enough people
like yourself collecting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't necessarily have to own them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to know that my friends can own
them and I can enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a perfect four hash because
of the three hole diffie.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really large holes so there's a
lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I mean usually like if you were
to design for doing anything like that
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd want the holes a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's more restriction.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one actually turned out perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it really is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ignoring the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather hit this pipe again.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mothership is loaded for you as well
when you're ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really different hit on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really tight.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow, this is really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the dome he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did this, like these were custom
productions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't very similar to other ones
that he's made but all the work on it was
[SPEAKER_03]: custom request.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted the fade to clear flyer coming
out.
Can
[SPEAKER_03]: you see the stuff they're doing at Alberg
right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so just for everybody's knowledge
sake, Cory and all the other really
[SPEAKER_03]: talented Canadian artists are in Alberg,
Denmark right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hippo, Stratus, GT Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can follow them on Instagram at
Smoking Gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah we'll see what more beautiful
things they start producing out of that
[SPEAKER_02]: shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a couple more weeks or a week
more to go so I'm sure they'll produce
[SPEAKER_02]: some more great glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you collect glass, keep it safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty darn important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I did have a pretty nice Marcel,
like number three from 1999 of the three
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces that he did that year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had it in a Pelican case and I had it on
a bike and I was cruising around and I
[SPEAKER_02]: stopped at Arians, his apartment above the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Howard Marks was there and
Neville was there and Breeder Steve was
[SPEAKER_02]: there and I showed them the pipe and
everyone was excited and we smoked out of
[SPEAKER_02]: it and I kind of put it back and I thought
I was leaving on my bike and at the last
[SPEAKER_02]: minute I got invited to go with them to I
believe one of Arians Rose and I forgot
[SPEAKER_02]: the pipe on the bike parked out in front
of the greenhouse on the Dan Brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a way it went.
[SPEAKER_02]: No!
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have the pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never got stolen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came back hours later and it was sitting
on the back of the bike right where I left
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then the value of that pipe was
$2,500 US dollars and it really seemed
[SPEAKER_02]: like a lot at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's more like $15,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, this is just a preview of a little
show that Flav and I are going to be doing
[SPEAKER_02]: soon called Baker's Dozen and we're going
to be hitting 12 epically beautiful head
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus one to make it a Baker's Dozen and
hopefully we'll be bringing you that
[SPEAKER_02]: sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you'll be happy with the pipes we
choose to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess at this point Flav and I are
going to hit another bowl but we'll talk
[SPEAKER_02]: to you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
