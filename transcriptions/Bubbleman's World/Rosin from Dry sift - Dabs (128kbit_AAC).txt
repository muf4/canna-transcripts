[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome back to part two of the
Rosin tech I have of course made a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of it here I can got a little dab here
hanging from the from the dabber and Get
[SPEAKER_00]: that lost That's the way she's gonna go So
yeah, I've got the dabber here filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice little rip of rosin I've got the
little bit on the piece here that I made
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last video a little bit of dry sift
rosin that was pressed out of here little
[SPEAKER_00]: no melts for you Made the rosin you guys
saw the video how great it worked how easy
[SPEAKER_00]: it was Was with the 25 micron screen the
25 micron screen is reusable Jeff Church
[SPEAKER_00]: was saying that he he cleans his with
either and like a pure alcohol grain
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol or even an isopropanol I would
prefer a grain alcohol personally the
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner the cleaner the better and that's
what I'll do to reuse mine I'm also gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: try and make some smaller pieces that are
more fitting almost circular pieces that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can start Selling on the site so that
people have access to this screen you can
[SPEAKER_00]: heat it up and it's not gonna Release any
type of chemicals so that's important and
[SPEAKER_00]: then of course what you guys all were
missing was the rip so without further ado
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the The special nail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if we can get this under hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep beautiful beautiful Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit different from working
with With hash that I'm so used to but the
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin still pretty pretty deal with both
so I've got the silicon carbide nail with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sapphire insert if you can see that
let me see if I can get it a little closer
[SPEAKER_00]: for you guys Yeah, sapphire insert you can
see I've taken one rep already And that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the rip that you guys are gonna get to
watch on the nail as I take this rip now
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing I noticed was The boiling and
the bubbling and the melting doesn't so
[SPEAKER_00]: much occur when you've gotten rid of the
wax membrane I always thought it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes boiling Out, but you'll see in
the video that it's mostly just oil on the
[SPEAKER_00]: sapphire slowly smoking off So here we go
Rosin dry sift rips through the Taurus
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it has a very similar taste to the dry
sip keep in mind this was dry sip that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't that good It has the flavor of that
dry sift minus whatever that I mean it's
[SPEAKER_00]: increased the potency in the and the
quality guaranteed even in the taste Now
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll admit I probably used more heat than
was necessary But really what I can taste
[SPEAKER_00]: is a purified version of the dry sip that
I wasn't as fond of now It's a tough gig
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and make a rosin taste as good as a
six-star full melt Because you've already
[SPEAKER_00]: grown that six-star full melt so properly
the terpenes are already present and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course Jeff talked a little bit about how
his Terpene content went up in hash church
[SPEAKER_00]: on when he tested his material which makes
sense If you get rid of the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hash and squeeze out just a smaller
amount of the oil You would think that
[SPEAKER_00]: your terpene ratio would go up just from
the removal of the wax membranes However,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's not us get confused at the fact that
those terpenes are going to be altered due
[SPEAKER_00]: to the fact that heat was present Mark
mentioned one of the sesquiterpenoids
[SPEAKER_00]: cariophylline it starts evaporating At 107
degrees and there's other ones present as
[SPEAKER_00]: well at those low temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously The the 200 degree
temperature of the rosin tech is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat that up But that's why we're figuring
out ways to do it quicker get it off
[SPEAKER_00]: faster and this is not by any means a
replacement for learning how to dry sift
[SPEAKER_00]: or learning how to Wet wash what this is
is another thing for you to put in your
[SPEAKER_00]: quiver another great way to test a bud if
You don't smoke bud and don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just another option for you guys
So don't think too deeply into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start bashing it just yet,
you know, give it a shot It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you that the the resin Potency
wise goes up more in my opinion than three
[SPEAKER_00]: stars the the high that I have From that
hit of what was considered a three star
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sift that I wasn't even hitting To
bump that up to the quality that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say enough about it I probably
will do a video with the pressing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds when I finally get a little t-shirt
press Because the hair iron just isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing any resin from the bud So yeah,
stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course stay tuned for Barcelona
I'll be leaving in the next couple of days
[SPEAKER_00]: to fly down for spandibus and we'll be
doing a large of a huge variety of videos
[SPEAKER_00]: down there I hope and most importantly the
one I'm really excited about is hash
[SPEAKER_00]: church Todd McCormick set up with Ben
drunkers the owner of The sensei seed
[SPEAKER_00]: museum in Amsterdam as well as down in
Barcelona that we're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: film in his 15th century building That is
approximately, you know 10,000 square feet
[SPEAKER_00]: of just epicness Ben does not cut any
corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a real quality guy and it'll be
interesting to see You know hash church
[SPEAKER_00]: film did at the at the head museum So
please come by and check that out next
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: West Coast time BC time which will be
about six p.m In Barcelona, so we look
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to seeing you there And yeah,
props!
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep watching bubble man's world.
Peace!
[SPEAKER_00]: You You You You You
