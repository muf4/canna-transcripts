changed from that moment on it was kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: like a heavy vibe We were a little bit
kind of having a rough morning and then
[SPEAKER_04]: then someone just gave me the finger for
Basically for nothing for nothing and it
[SPEAKER_04]: was his opportunity Darren saw the
opportunity There's the plug if I can just
[SPEAKER_01]: pop that off all of this will release I
open the window just that much just so I
[SPEAKER_01]: can get my lips out even so they can hear
it was like that and just was
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone that had ever listened to hash

[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and We'll say hi to tie to Johnny
last night I talked to him and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you said he feels a hundred percent better
and Johnny is the type of guy that will
[SPEAKER_01]: say I'm feeling good when he's not because
he's just doesn't want to put his energy
[SPEAKER_01]: out on people like that, but I phoned him
and asked him and he told me the
[SPEAKER_01]: vibrations the The the pains that he'd get
in his arms and his leg and all that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff Are gone like literally he got
out of surgery on his neck He's in a neck
[SPEAKER_01]: brace.

[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I got a little I got into
a little go-kart accident in September I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember and I actually had a fracture in
here somewhere.

after after the MRI Now the feelings that
[SPEAKER_01]: the vibrations and the little bits of
shooting pain that I get from that Down my
[SPEAKER_01]: arm and down this leg.

[SPEAKER_01]: me back the purple punch was the one that
punched Me right in the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

hitting a pen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, dude Crazy to see you up in the
bed, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: How well tell us tell us what's the deal?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 10 years in the waiting 11 years in
the waiting for what you just went through
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy and simple Posterior cervical that
can be fusion c3 a c6 They took out my c4
[SPEAKER_02]: because my spinal cord was deflated and
compressed so when they took the c4 off my
[SPEAKER_02]: spinal cord inflated like a balloon and
With that giving my relief the burning of
[SPEAKER_02]: my knees went away the burning of my feet
my hands had neuropathy So that's changed
[SPEAKER_02]: this vibration in my body for the last 10
years is gone It really took an effect on
[SPEAKER_02]: July 14th in 2014 when I had a car
accident and it pinched the cord and
[SPEAKER_02]: caused major That's where the burning
really started.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where they found what was
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are almost like a year and a
half two years later and Damn surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Geez open in the back your neck and
you're feeling great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude, don't be moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're freaking me out Hey, I guess what
we brought turps for you T420s got the
[SPEAKER_04]: turps in the in the pelican.
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought we'd come give Johnny be a
little bouquet flavor of turps I'm a
[SPEAKER_02]: spinal ward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the C unit and this is where a
lot of trauma people I see here alarms
[SPEAKER_02]: going off and I'll be here on Support
systems and reading and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually very lucky to be but I
mean this is a very serious word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I'm quite I mean interiors because I
got up and I was able to stand up and most
[SPEAKER_02]: people know I have to get up because my
knees My knees don't burn anymore Wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that was that's that's 10 years in the
making And so what what are you choosing
[SPEAKER_04]: to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously they must have you on
all sorts of medications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you excellent?
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the peanut butter bar that you
ate earlier Pure CBD and I'm using the CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: for inflammation Oh, yeah, that's right
there I got my But you have any terpenes I
[SPEAKER_04]: think it's then that's what we brought
we've Filling yeah, we've got the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: whole tray Full of terpenes for Johnny B
to to go through and check out so many
[SPEAKER_04]: flavors here, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous like Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is well, this one's purple punch
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let him smell this one Open that up and
just give that a little waft under your
[SPEAKER_04]: nose Close and far as you know to catch To
catch the Purple punch on that one
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too shabby, hey
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it goes away right away we smell it I
call it the wow factor
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting Look at that you get the whole
we just shut this thing We just shut this
[SPEAKER_03]: thing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the light switch?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't the red one.
[SPEAKER_02]: No that says exam Yeah, right should be a
right light switch Either on the wall it
[SPEAKER_04]: says exam.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a red switch No, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's one that pulls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Yeah Damn try to not want to touch
anything on this wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a switch right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one that says suction regulator Terps
Get in there D
[SPEAKER_03]: Do some modulation with this a Little
smelling a little turpent here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get you another flavor to smell so
that was the purple punch Well,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them to try the red Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh f gooey actually F gooey actually There
we go Having a huge Session at Johnny B's
[SPEAKER_03]: hospital bed Well, it'll go suck on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just doesn't have a lid but it's a
mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry a lid Pistachios It's a little slow
going
[SPEAKER_04]: So many wonderful flavors to smell that's
amazing That one's got a variety of
[SPEAKER_04]: flavors going on and it's very uplifting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know if it's fruity though,
or if it's what it is, but it's definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: like You can even from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can smell it really strong Yeah,
it's like fruity cushions Which changes
[SPEAKER_04]: the fruit aspect fruit bowl maybe that's
going slightly bad That first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can actually feel how this one didn't
the purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just is kind of some of the release or
something released this one doesn't Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've got time to go through here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Let's put this one away
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try strawberry mind work Now I like
that one I always smell like a strawberry
[SPEAKER_04]: banana esque smell as I take it away Right
and if you smell it enough times you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: that banana turns into you can see the
similarities between the strawberry purple
[SPEAKER_02]: punch again
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting this noodle soup with slight
hints of turps Which is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not bad Smell it off the lid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming really strong off the lid
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it actually the smell was so there
it's like the pain goes interesting And
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm sitting here in pain Right,
I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So um, but the other two didn't that's why
I wanted to go back on her Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious Because one thing
you're looking at is how those turpients
[SPEAKER_03]: are emolliculating everything Here's one
that everyone loves Kim dog Yep,
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that one And when I bring it to
here, here's a little it's a kill exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: What I noticed with it is that from
different angles and distances from my
[SPEAKER_04]: nose I can smell things that I don't smell
otherwise like they have their very fine
[SPEAKER_04]: Areas of where you can pick that subtle
Smell up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting I'm zooming in on
Johnny's bolt marks like Frankenstein
[SPEAKER_02]: bolted his head to the table head right to
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the red Congolese The red
Congolese
[SPEAKER_04]: Land-race turpines turpines that aren't
present in a lot of the other flavors that
[SPEAKER_04]: they have similarities and differences But
the differences between this is different
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just with that little bit of Spice in
the background.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of that case family where you
catch it at the end It's one of the ones
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the most excited about I'm not gonna
lie Yeah, it's super beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here's a nice one Everyone loves this
one Lemon kush lemon kush the kush And
[SPEAKER_02]: this one isn't doing anything Interesting
purple punch was the strongest punch was
[SPEAKER_02]: the strongest because I can just feel my
neck Interesting and all we're really
[SPEAKER_02]: doing is having light smells, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, this is huge It's quite a
difference in smells that's the orange
[SPEAKER_04]: creamsicle Man I'm telling you like the
lids are incredible That's nice It's also
[SPEAKER_04]: like what I find about it this strange is
when I smell It I find that I want a
[SPEAKER_04]: picture pictures in my mind This is you
know if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is like orange creamsicle is good
I think you're also gonna like pineapple
[SPEAKER_04]: cream Well exactly obviously obviously
That you love turps pineapple cream,
[SPEAKER_04]: how did I do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a deserty tasting and smell Like
like whipped cream and salad with
[SPEAKER_02]: dominating pineapple in it Close your eyes
and really like breathe it in gently not
[SPEAKER_02]: just really close but also from a distance
[SPEAKER_04]: Wafting Wafting so we can find ones that
we don't Guaranteed there's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: turps that heal and the turps that
basically don't another great one I Really
[SPEAKER_04]: like this one and someone told me it was
sunset sherbert crossed with og kb or
[SPEAKER_04]: something And they said in those in the
comments kb stands for Oh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's leave Johnny doesn't like the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: No Johnny hates the turps maybe it's cuz
He's had a whole bunch of fucking smells
[SPEAKER_01]: of it already You got too many turps in
his nose palette This one's interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: chocolate Go
[SPEAKER_04]: from a distance and then slowly kind of
bring it up So until you can just it's on
[SPEAKER_04]: the edge of really being powerful Because
some of them are also too strong to smell
[SPEAKER_04]: right close to your nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are good I like the pineapple cream
and the orange cream school the purple
[SPEAKER_04]: punches.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something for clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is triple og.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised at that Oh, yeah,
it's deep that one's deep hits the right I
[SPEAKER_04]: just felt that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah go into me Hopefully Tony's coming up
here one of these days sooner than later
[SPEAKER_04]: or if not, maybe one day our Jamaica
project well Get off the ground and we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: be able to go down and do the good work Do
the good work that we were so inclined to
[SPEAKER_04]: do that is the gorilla glue It's also a
very strong strain It's a strong one but
[SPEAKER_04]: different right different than what your
what would really be cool is if we had an
[SPEAKER_04]: idea is to the profiles This one's the
blue
[SPEAKER_04]: Dream Pretty pretty pretty popular strain
down in Cali can be grown on a commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: level and still produce a pretty nice
product
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to do it with eucalyptus oil with
headaches I'd kind of like breathing
[SPEAKER_04]: eucalyptus oil and I just felt a little
bit of a relief so I can kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: understand where you're coming from,
but obviously I've never had spine surgery
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine what you feel like right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus they screwed into your head your head
must hurt Cool scars bro cool scars This
[SPEAKER_01]: is the cheese bomb she gets some fucking
bolts tattooed on each one of those scars
[SPEAKER_04]: You could they're right on your hairline
venom no, is this Venomo G or Let me smell
[SPEAKER_02]: just like turning it down like a seven
cheese ball out first one that we pulled
[SPEAKER_02]: out there that blue one cheesy a purple
punch Cherry AK-47
[SPEAKER_04]: I like when his eyebrows go up He's all
like filming the corner You actually had
[SPEAKER_04]: it perfectly framed When I saw you doing
that I was like what I would end up doing
[SPEAKER_04]: if I did But he does have the nice wide
angle well what you've yelled at me too
[SPEAKER_01]: many times And beat me with sticks that to
make me not cherry AK-47 fucking screw
[SPEAKER_01]: that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot screw that up I hate getting beat
up by my bro bubble man uses a stick a big
[SPEAKER_04]: one, but it's made out of toilet paper It
still hurts Purple Hindu I had a feeling
[SPEAKER_04]: you were gonna like it I don't know if it
just has that purple name in it and the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple is hitting full full I want him to
smell that that strawberry purple venom
[SPEAKER_01]: the venom OG venom There was one moment in
there that I hit the pause button Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: by accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and I clicked it right back on right
