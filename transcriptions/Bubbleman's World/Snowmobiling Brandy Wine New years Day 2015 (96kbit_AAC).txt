[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to head around back,
and we're going to hit a little safety
[SPEAKER_06]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt, of course, is holding it down at the
back of the cabin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is a nice view you got here for
your safety meeting there, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, it's killer, eh?

[SPEAKER_06]: Just fucking get high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just fucking get high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm joining this session.

[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Epic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So beautiful up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys want to check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the color, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: The color is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like rainbows in the sky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brandy wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are up in the brandy wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the House of the Great Gardener is not
telling a lie.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is absolutely spectacular, beautiful up
here right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got up here on snowmobiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the funnest part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're on snowmobiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a little bit of video on the GoPro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of our little adventure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, hold this for a sec.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotta load this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grabbed a piece of the 9 or 10 or 11 or
12 kind hash.
Can't smoke in the helmets.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said don't smoke in the helmets.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his only rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got a great guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think at the start he thought I might
have been the guy to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he doesn't realize.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was just like, I'm not that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm trying to go fast, too,
so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm at the front because I'm like
the, you know, let's watch this girl.
[SPEAKER_05]: She can set the pace, maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just getting used to these crazy BC
sleds with the giant fins that all of a
[SPEAKER_03]: sudden you hit the gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you're drifting all the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like drifting around corners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love drifting.
[SPEAKER_06]: These sleds are like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, Matt might be the guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's walking back.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's getting excited, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: He can feel it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, dude, let's get to that bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get too close to Aaron and then he guns
it and all of a sudden it rockets me in
[SPEAKER_03]: the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, I can't get.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's tailgating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were from Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the little pieces of ice hurt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you two hear that rumor that you don't
tailgate up in Canada?
What?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said you're from Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't be tailgating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you've driven around in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tailgate hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have what's called New Canadians?
[SPEAKER_03]: Safety break.
[SPEAKER_03]: Safety break.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our tour guide lets us have safety break.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hiding behind this little tiny
cabin, puffing on melty bubble,
[SPEAKER_06]: 12 kinds or more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Safety break.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here comes Unity in the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're in the mountains, driving your
sled around, puffing on doobies and some
[SPEAKER_03]: melty kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have more, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to head around.
[SPEAKER_06]: But awesome safety meeting with you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'll grab it from the end of the side.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just took a break here in the
Brandywine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Aaron's little daughter from DNA is
going to get on her own little sled.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check this fun out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this little guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mars.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: This
[SPEAKER_06]: is called whore frost.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is called whore frost.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what this is, is this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great example.
[SPEAKER_06]: This creates a really unstable layer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when the snow falls on top of this
snow, this will be the layer that causes
[SPEAKER_06]: the avalanche.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you get 10 feet on top of it,
this is where it'll break.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful whore frost.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what would cause the avalanches in
the back country.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many, many times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not always, but often it's a fracture in
the snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys want to have a big puff down here
or what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a pipe?
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the pipe out, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: He won't look.
[SPEAKER_06]: He won't.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on, Marty!
Keep pressing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, every time you press it,
it makes you go more.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me honestly, do you guys ever just
take a moment and have rips around here?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually pretty stuck out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll show you right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: On your knees?
[SPEAKER_06]: But man, the nicest sled ever to get
stuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pick it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going nowhere fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to follow me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mars.
[SPEAKER_06]: There she goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the difference right here between
boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little girl, keep pushing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep pushing it, little boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop pushing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop pushing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we like that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cautious women.
[SPEAKER_06]: Voice of reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking retarded guys, but that's a
nice way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cautious women, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cautious women.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not retarded guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's just so cute for Mars.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a couple more runs and you'll
see she'll be like an expert.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is so cool.
That is so awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, as far as little cool extras go,
that's a pretty cool little extra.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the bubbler?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Dave, what do you got there?
[SPEAKER_06]: A little Corycontinum.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we got for a dabber?
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, it's mini dunks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my dab right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, chilling out with these clowns,
these hilarious clowns.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, not all clowns suck.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hash clowns like Hitty City.
[SPEAKER_02]: City Hitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: City Hitty.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a hash clown.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be proud to be a hash clown.
[SPEAKER_06]: City Hitty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the mountains, hey,
the epicness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good boys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, this is so awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: To be able to actually take a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we got going on here,
by the way, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to give you an idea of what Flav
brought up for Snowmobile.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little Cory.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sick, mini, awesome piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's her sled piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on with your sled?
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were going down that big hill,
the truck dropped off on it, and then it
[SPEAKER_06]: never came back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sledding.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dramatic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always something happens to someone's
sled.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Always.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're lucky we got the sleds out of the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at those mountains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish we had spent more time up on the
top playground area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy a sled.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy a sled.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe just sell a pipe and buy a sled.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the sickest thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a video.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a video, Flav.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flav's sled pipe trade.
[SPEAKER_06]: Picture time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Picture time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the sun behind you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be good for black shadows.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So sunny.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to get the sun in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a ridiculous rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't tell your boss if you want any of
this either.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rips in the back country.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course he should.

a long time since I stopped ammobiling

There we go Give you another little blip
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabbin' at the dabbin' Yeah you just got
to love the epic beauty of Whistler from
[SPEAKER_06]: hanging out one day on the mountain to
hanging out across the street in the
[SPEAKER_06]: backcountry area to going with the kids
tobogganing or sledding yeah which we're
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna do next yeah we've got a bunch more
sort of fun things organized we should we
[SPEAKER_06]: may get onto ziplines we may get to
ballots the trampoline flips yeah ziplines
[SPEAKER_09]: okay that'll be amazing yeah slow and easy
we should hit this dosa too this dosa
[SPEAKER_06]: hasn't been hit yet oh no we can't because
as I brought it over here as I brought
[SPEAKER_06]: both of them over here I realized no
lighter no V-Line but don't they look nice
[SPEAKER_04]: they are pretty look at that we can hit it
right away afterwards they'll like bookend
[SPEAKER_04]: the shot for us here right I like it hit
another little rip of this and then we'll
[SPEAKER_06]: see what what the rest of the plan is for
our crew we have a huge crew and not any
[SPEAKER_06]: single person is making decisions it's all
of us sort of deciding what we're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's unity in this community as
well oh yes
[SPEAKER_04]: the backdrop to this place is just so it's
just so amazing the mountains I mean I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know if you guys can't really see
but there's pretty much the one you see
[SPEAKER_04]: right out the door to the left is called a
wedge wedge mountain and not just like the
[SPEAKER_04]: sun sets right on it so we get like this
beautiful like pink and orange sunsets it
[SPEAKER_04]: always has awesome colors on it for sure
it's brilliant yeah yeah I mean I'm sure
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys have all seen the the walkthrough
by now so you know what we're dealing with
[SPEAKER_06]: here absolutely and if you enjoyed the
little bit of sledding that you saw on
[SPEAKER_06]: this video you can check out another video
I have on here two of them actually which
[SPEAKER_06]: is called brandy wine teas and brandy wine
backcountry I don't know just put brandy
[SPEAKER_06]: wine backcountry bubble man or bubble
man's world and you should be able to find
[SPEAKER_06]: a whole hour-long video me and my friends
going to that same zone hooking up on a
[SPEAKER_06]: super duper powder day with some guys on
dirt bikes that had a conversion that you
[SPEAKER_06]: had sleds yeah so we have lots of footage
of them climbing the mountains and going
[SPEAKER_06]: off little cliffs and stuff and it'll let
you whistle anyway if if you enjoyed the
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit of sledding that you saw in
this video and otherwise I don't know I
[SPEAKER_06]: guess we're just going to continue to puff
here and maybe this video potentially is
[SPEAKER_06]: the end of today's video
maybe it's not
