[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys welcome to bubble man's world a
little bit of a new video today I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: out I'm gonna do one of my first reaction
videos and so I've been watching all sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of these different reaction characters
online mostly for Harry Mack which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be doing today I guess the first
guy I got turned on to was mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: video he was pretty hilarious he'd smoke
joints and and react to different you know
[SPEAKER_00]: songs that he had never heard before I
thought that was a pretty cool concept and
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of grew and grew and grew and I've
been watching you know I think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: Cliff Beats who's like a ghostwriter for
the rap industry and he does reactions
[SPEAKER_00]: that I kind of like and I watch no life
shack is another one that's pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: and then recently oh my goodness I hope I
can remember his name he's the poet he's
[SPEAKER_00]: the poet gentleman and so jeez I'll
remember and I'll put it in the comments
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's really good he does great
Harry Mack reactions I don't pretend to
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that I'm gonna be doing amazing
Harry Mack reactions I don't know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different lingo and whatnot in regards to
his you know skills and his ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: freestyle and his ability to just
absolutely off the top create entire songs
[SPEAKER_00]: that make full sense and have depth and
intellectualism and you know lyricism that
[SPEAKER_00]: is just absolutely next level so I want to
do a reaction video I don't even know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to really edit these right now so this is
just kind of my first shot the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do is rap Coltrane Harry Mack
rap Coltrane where he took it's a very Wu
[SPEAKER_00]: Tang s beat going on in the background he
just absolutely crushes this I may end up
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all three songs that he did as most
of the reaction videos I see are like that
[SPEAKER_00]: but I may just also to get this one out
and try and you know get my first one done
[SPEAKER_00]: under the belt I may just do the first
track on this so I guess without further
[SPEAKER_00]: ado let's watch Harry Mack
[SPEAKER_02]: this is just the shit I'm into getting
loose over instrumentals
[SPEAKER_02]: so I don't know how many of you caught
that but that was some pretty incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: double entendres going on there in regards
to I'll Make You Shake Your Ass if you go
