[SPEAKER_10]: Hey there's Todd.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here with Todd McCormick on the top
floor of the, I guess this is Sensi Seeds
[SPEAKER_10]: Museum.
[SPEAKER_10]: 150, what's the name of the street?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_10]: Me neither, but we'll show them anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the beautiful street that the
Sensi Seed Museum is on.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's their sign right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ben Dronkers and the Dronkers family have
these beautiful museums.
[SPEAKER_10]: One in Barcelona and one in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_10]: They used to have the seed shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure they still do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_10]: in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dab Flav.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to see you boys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to seize you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Giddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That chair may be taken.
[SPEAKER_10]: After a dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Giddy's taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: He doesn't want no turd mounts.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give it to him on that other pipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up Robbie?
[SPEAKER_12]: All good.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we are in Orlando Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes mon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today we will watch some of the
inductions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today we have Mark Emery and Howard Mark,
Mr. Nice getting inducted into,
[SPEAKER_10]: what would you guys say that they're being
inducted into here?
[SPEAKER_10]: The Cannabis Culture Awards.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Cannabis Culture Awards.
[SPEAKER_10]: Two members that are well deserving so
we'll be catching that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try to film as much of it as I can.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully Dane's gonna lend me his tripod
otherwise I gotta hold it the whole time.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what he says.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your camera's smaller.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here and I am at the
Sensi Seed's Hemp Museum here in the
[SPEAKER_10]: center of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's Green Pete.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, hey, hey, it's the Weed Pete.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Weed Pete.
[SPEAKER_10]: Weed Pete.
[SPEAKER_10]: Weed Pete.
[SPEAKER_10]: Grower Pete and Processor Pete and
Hashmaker Pete.
[SPEAKER_10]: I only have a customer of the product.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Customer Pete.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, that right there was a little
thing called Sinterklaas and here in
[SPEAKER_10]: Amsterdam they have Sinterklaas.
[SPEAKER_10]: They usually have Black Pete which I
personally find a little bit offensive.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Weed Pete much better.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're here at the Sensi Seed's Weed and
Hemp Museum and we're about to watch Mark
[SPEAKER_10]: Emery and Howard Marks get inducted into
the Cannabis Culture Hall of Fame.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see right here, Cannabis Culture
Awards.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Howard, Mr. Nice, and my good
friend Mark Emery and Jody Emery from my
[SPEAKER_10]: hometown in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're gonna see them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Rob.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Robert Connell Clark is in the house
today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't this cool?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna see Howard and Mark get
inducted.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All you Canadian folks out there,
you can be proud.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll talk to you a little bit later
when we're inside.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll let you get to what you were going to
do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was following a beautiful woman
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_10]: That happens in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick, follow her.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, we're gonna head in here real soon
so why don't you come with me?
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go over there to find a spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to invite everyone which is
not going to be on stage so I'm excluding
[SPEAKER_08]: the winners obviously.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like you to slowly but surely make
your way towards the gallery so we can
[SPEAKER_08]: have a seat.
[SPEAKER_08]: The program will then start.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much and we'll make a
killer shot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_10]: See you, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been here a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we just got told now to come here
and we were with everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark and Emory.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Howard's here too.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see Alan now?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cup Awards.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because you just told me about the
Cannabis Cup.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis Culture Awards 2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is an incredible moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, this ceremony is somehow a bit
interrupted, will be interrupted later on
[SPEAKER_04]: because one of our guests and nominees is
a bit late.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be recorded, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you may applaud or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Michael.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you lower the mic a little bit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have a pretty little kind of
senior morale in my head now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a television director or program maker
so to speak for the Dutch National Public
[SPEAKER_04]: Television Station called EGRO,
Broadcaster.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a show host and I'm not a
presenter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something I do on a regular
basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please pardon me if I make some noise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: To my dad, I don't know if he needs an
inscription.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Drunkers, Mr. Sensesies, Mr. Hash
Marijuana Museum, Mr. Actually also,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe the one who came up with the prize
or invented it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, can you please lower the mic a
little bit because there is really,
[SPEAKER_04]: it feels like I'm in a bathroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, but it's, you know, the Cannabis
Festival was something like, we have a
[SPEAKER_03]: museum nearly 30 years and I see only in
my vision that a museum will exist another
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of hundred years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on that moment, I had a few people
that I really admire and everybody got
[SPEAKER_03]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially, you know, I think what
we're doing as activists, as people who
[SPEAKER_03]: love the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love cannabis and we see the source and
the uses of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought, you know, there should be
something to remember in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a few people that I really... You know
what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to see this very soon because
we have the story actually for you well
[SPEAKER_04]: edited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming up very soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next to Mr. Drunkers is his daughter,
Shiva, who, she's also got her name
[SPEAKER_04]: Sparmer, but actually also called Drunkers
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And next, she is one of the, she called
herself yesterday, Alchemane Medemaker,
[SPEAKER_04]: but let's do it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: She runs the place, sort of, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Next to her is her brother, Adam,
who goes by the name of the professor of
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, he degrees stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, he has a lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Worked there for a long time here,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you don't deny that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grew up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grew up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Born in a green... Yeah, yeah,
he fell on the port.
[SPEAKER_04]: He fell on the port.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: From Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then to my right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom McCormick, who was actually once aware
of... It's true, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Deny that too?
Yeah.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I first came here 20 years ago
and was one of the first group of people
[SPEAKER_12]: that walked into the cannabis castle and
then opened it up to the public and was
[SPEAKER_12]: inspired forever.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a castle in the south,
somewhere in the south of the island,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sort of paradise.
[SPEAKER_12]: For an American coming out from the drug
war, it was paradise.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a dream to have a basement full of
cannabis and a beautiful farm.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the education is a huge part of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to be part of this museum and part of
what we're doing, which is educating
[SPEAKER_12]: everybody to the wonders of the plant,
is very honorable.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have... Maybe it's sounding
almost clich√©, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you told us the prince and princess
of all...
[SPEAKER_04]: The prince and princess.
[SPEAKER_05]: The prince and princess.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just kind of got princess all the
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You married a prince.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also true, and maybe not all of
you know, that you're a free man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just moved out of jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I got out of U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: federal prison on August 12th.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I blame Ben Gronkisch for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because he got up in this very spot,
in this very town, on this very day,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years ago, and boasted in his calm,
smug way that he had planted millions and
[SPEAKER_02]: millions of plants around the world for
his service at Sensei Seeds and that this
[SPEAKER_02]: was creating disturbances and revolutions
and changes of opinion and heart and
[SPEAKER_02]: politics everywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was so inspired by that I got up and
I said, I'm gonna do just like him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna do just like him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna do that
for all of North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did do that, and so it's his fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heavily fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also very happy to... Could Mike,
at least, or Mark, and myself go a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit...
[SPEAKER_04]: We are also very grateful that Mr. Skye is
here, Dad Skye.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now let me put it this way,
the high times are coming, cannabis is
[SPEAKER_04]: coming, which is actually a... Which has
not so much to do with you at all,
[SPEAKER_04]: does it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's really amazing that Ed
Rosenblatt, who did the first time,
[SPEAKER_03]: he did it in my restaurant, he came home
with six hundred dollars to start a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did it with Case Hooker,
famous artist from Amsterdam who started
[SPEAKER_03]: all the clones for one building at a time
with him, and Jasper Cronenfeld,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's a poet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these guys, they started the cannabis
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so you're guilty by association.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was guilty by association.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I propose, by the way, so it's a bit...
The program is a bit shaky because our
[SPEAKER_04]: last guest, Mr. Nice, I guess everybody
knows him, sort of, is a bit late
[SPEAKER_04]: because...
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the reason?
[SPEAKER_13]: His flight got canceled.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flight got canceled.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another flight, he was not allowed to
board.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another flight, well, something like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's in the air right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in the air, high in the sky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, so I propose that we roll a video
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe lower the lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a way to discover the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And ease her pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: It gave him the insights.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he fights for worldwide acceptance.
[SPEAKER_07]: This material has been essential over ages
and has enormous strength.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for animal care.
[SPEAKER_07]: And creates conscious fashion.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can even use it for a durable future.
[SPEAKER_07]: No wonder this influential plant has its
own award.
[SPEAKER_07]: This man won it for his clear vision.
[SPEAKER_07]: He won it for his responsive politics.
[SPEAKER_07]: This man won it for his global crusade.
[SPEAKER_07]: His research gave the plant its power.
[SPEAKER_07]: His history, a free-thinking politician.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like all our winners, being brave,
persistent, being true.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the acceptance of cannabis in all its
forms, they marked the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis Culture Awards, mark the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: Proudly presented by the Hash Marijuana
and hemp museum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, maybe it is time to get a bit more
serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because apparently, as far as I'm aware,
somehow I have the impression that around
[SPEAKER_04]: the world we see more and more places or
states, at least in the United States,
[SPEAKER_04]: where at least some kind of legalization
takes place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, officially, in Canada,
it is... October 19, 2050 is Legalization
[SPEAKER_02]: Day in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our federal election, in which party do
you want to support, supports
legalization?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is the Green Party or the Italian
party?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Liberal Party of Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Liberal Party of Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Liberal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which has governed our nation for most of
its history.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's get more serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because funny enough, or strange enough,
or tragically enough, in this lovely
[SPEAKER_04]: little country, this delta, somehow things
are changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we feel sort of, I don't know if you
can call it $10.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is cooking?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unexplainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like everybody's saying, most experts,
you can't explain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so dumb or corrupt.
But what is happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's... They try to... They say,
well, we should get rid of the coffee
[SPEAKER_03]: shops, we should get rid of this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've come with a green pass,
you know, that everybody can sort of get
[SPEAKER_03]: any card that you are allowed to buy from
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to keep the tourists out of the
area in the south of the capital,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they have problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good thing I'm too stoned to care.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, by the way, maybe I can ask
you... I can ask you... Where's the mic?
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, maybe you can inform us,
Mr. Sky, of... Maybe you can inform us,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe you can inform us of the troubles
that you have faced.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I get to sit down?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much better on my feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let me just talk for a few minutes
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll sit down, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Too tall for the cameras, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, my name is Dan Sky for the
magazine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Ben Drawker is here.
[SPEAKER_06]: He knows me as Malcom McKinnon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I came here in 1996 with Hemp Times
Magazine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the first time I interviewed
Ben.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I changed my name,
because I was working for both magazines
[SPEAKER_06]: simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my name is Malcom.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the Dutch people know me as Malcom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the Americans know me by my fake
name.
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, this has been a wild week.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the Dutch coffee shop industry
is who we depend on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have been incredibly sympathetic
and incredibly supportive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're appalled by what has gone down
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to correct some information
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact is, we have been coming here 26
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get our permits in order.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't go anywhere, whether it's LA or
whether it's San Francisco or Denver,
[SPEAKER_06]: without dealing with the local
authorities.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we have done.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have dealt with the authorities all the
way along.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Dutch lawyers dealing with the
mayors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the end, he shut us down.
[SPEAKER_06]: There has been some misinformation out
there that we needed a permit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is incorrect.
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor was threatening the permits of
the venues that we were trying to enter.
[SPEAKER_06]: As simple as that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They targeted the cannabis cup after 26
years and shut down the expo part,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people who are supporting the
pioneers, the real rebels who are out
[SPEAKER_06]: there on the front lines every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the activists, the people who are in
business, because their lives are at
[SPEAKER_06]: stake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other people's jobs are at stake.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a chance for the cannabis
community to network, for the public to
[SPEAKER_06]: meet the merchandisers, the people to meet
the companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been shut down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're appalled.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the fact is, what Ben said
before, we're moving backwards here in
[SPEAKER_06]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say we because my roots are here
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where the cannabis cup roots are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the United States, we're making
tremendous progress.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have cannabis cups now six times a
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: If this will be the same next year,
could it mean that you will leave the
[SPEAKER_04]: Netherlands and go?
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope not.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said, the roots of the cannabis cup
are here in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can't say that we particularly feel
welcome this week.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact is, on Sunday I was down there
after the cup blew apart.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was down there in the coffee shop
district and all the people were smoking
[SPEAKER_06]: and having a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis culture is part of Dutch culture
at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact that for these two old white
men to say, no, we don't want Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_06]: we don't want to die.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the cat's on the bone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two old white men.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor and the minister of justice.
All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get it out in the open.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys are good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get rid of these dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to ask, why do you think
they are doing this this year?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to know why we've been
charging this particular year.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know for a fact they use this as an
excuse many times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very
much.
[SPEAKER_13]: To answer your question.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the excuse is the European Union
and there has been this contract sort of
[SPEAKER_13]: that we cannot.
[SPEAKER_13]: But one of our former winners and former
prime minister of the Netherlands already
[SPEAKER_13]: stated on the cannabis culture awards in
2010 that it's... But they do use it a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a theory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our movement is making enormous gains in
many different places.
[SPEAKER_05]: But our enemies hate us.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still hate us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they're losing, they'll fight
back harder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like we have to fight back harder if
we're losers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, even though we're making
progress, they're going to fight back if
[SPEAKER_05]: they really want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people in positions of authority
perhaps want to flex that muscle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if they feel alone, they feel like a
warrior.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like many of our activists perhaps
down in South Africa feel alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they feel like a warrior for their
cause.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just floating that theory that
maybe this is one lone guy saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then again, then again, though it may be
true, and we have somebody here,
[SPEAKER_04]: a farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's now very famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he wants to be a little pro-hook
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's now in Hokkaido.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we call this?
[SPEAKER_04]: In a wheel, because he was a bona fide
farmer, a grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So things are changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then again, we are still kind of
liberalish in this country.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, still we are sitting here,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this could happen in Canada too now,
or in soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could happen in Vancouver or Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much can you have with you there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not a legal amount, unless you're
federally allowed for the government.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tolerance is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could this happen now in Canada?
[SPEAKER_05]: There are many events with a lot of
marijuana, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our journalists go to probably several
locations in Canada where they have
[SPEAKER_02]: regular cannabis exhibitions and judging
going to all day parties.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also have a government that has
cracked down and has stopped letting
[SPEAKER_05]: people and patients grow their own plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no, they're not getting licenses
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody now can get a license.
[SPEAKER_04]: I propose that although we all know who
Ben is, that we still... There's a nice
[SPEAKER_04]: little film a short teacher made about
Ben.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can install that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, do you hear me, what I'm saying?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Culture Awards, our initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben Dronkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a young man in the early 1970s,
Dronkers gradually began what was to
[SPEAKER_00]: become a lifelong quest to unlock the
potential of the cannabis plant and to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the quality of human life
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, Dronkers has founded and
continues to run various cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: related enterprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensi Seeds has become the leading
international seed bank and has been
[SPEAKER_00]: setting the standard for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cannabis gene bank was responsible
for preserving medicinal grade cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, approved and sold by the Bureau
of Medical Cannabis, an organization run
[SPEAKER_00]: by the Dutch government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp Flags, established in the mid-90s,
is one of Europe's largest producers and
[SPEAKER_00]: processors of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hashemara Wine and Hemp Museum in
Amsterdam was opened in 1985 and presents
[SPEAKER_00]: a permanent exhibition about the history
and uses of the cannabis plant around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The museum has over 100,000 visitors a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year saw the grand opening of the
Hashemara Wine and Hemp Museum,
[SPEAKER_00]: located in the beautifully renovated
Raunau Palace in the historical center of
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2004, the museum confers the
Cannabis Culture Awards upon those who
[SPEAKER_00]: have distinguished themselves in the
struggle for acceptance of cannabis in all
[SPEAKER_00]: of its forms.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are somehow inspired by Ben,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that besides probably that
it was also a profitable business,
[SPEAKER_04]: you both also had a, let's say,
not political, but activist view.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it was you, I don't remember who
it was, who came up with the idea like,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're gonna force legalization by our
seeds, just by spreading the seeds all
[SPEAKER_04]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who coined them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant the seeds of freedom, overgrow the
government.
[SPEAKER_02]: And overgrow is like a biological way,
instead of overthrow, which is a violent
[SPEAKER_02]: way, of changing the government against
their will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, they're not gonna come
around to us philosophically, but we will
[SPEAKER_02]: force them to bend the ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by doing so, by having, my idea for me
was that I wanted to be the person that
[SPEAKER_02]: produced more marijuana in Canada and the
United States than the police forces in
[SPEAKER_02]: both countries were destroying the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of your idea too,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is what Mark said about
what is one very ethical question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's very conscientious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because they bought seeds in Amsterdam
in the show, and is it the seeds or the
[SPEAKER_03]: system?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know, the seeds are, it's nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but we have to go back to prison,
because we have to go, we will talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: it later, seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, I'm running out of schedule
already, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing it, I'm sort of reversing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you please explain us why you have
chosen, I mean, Trump has been elected,
[SPEAKER_04]: we will talk about it very soon,
why you have chosen Mrs. Nice,
[SPEAKER_04]: so to speak, and Mark Emery, a gentleman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that mean for the movement?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, this is a museum,
and in the museum, it's about history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the new history, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are part of a new history, and it's
not, there's so many people I would like
[SPEAKER_03]: to have at this museum, and it's all
around me, and there's so many that they
[SPEAKER_03]: should be, because they find so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of them, you know, they just come
out of the heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you ask me, they ask me,
who's the committee who decided to do
[SPEAKER_03]: this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, we don't have a
committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk a little bit with Shiva,
and with Alan, but you know, it's from the
[SPEAKER_03]: heart, and we follow you.
And you know what, Mark, I don't know if
you know it, but we're not only talking,
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't talk, and we don't just put
money, because we make money with seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we put money there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, my proud daughter, you know,
she was in the Canadian embassy,
protesting, pregnant, you know,
with a belly in the front of the gate,
protesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at him.
You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so proud of you, because it's in the
family, and it's the heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an international thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the love I have with Tom,
the love I have with Frank Baraka,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Hank DeVries, and all these people,
Jack Herriot.
All these people bring the price.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys, you know how I feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a family affair.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it's a whole...
[SPEAKER_03]: Legalization from his family.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that sense, we just light up... And now
we go to Mr. Bowie, because otherwise he's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be the host.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I find it quite interesting.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Bowie, tell you what, he's wired,
he's wired.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe even lower the volume a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Bowie, please stay, because not so
much that you are the strange w here,
[SPEAKER_04]: but originally, you got into conflict with
marijuana as a kid, because you were sick,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean that you are more,
let's say, from the side of the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that where you were exchanged from,
or how you started it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I was a child, I had cancer,
and my mother, who was back in 1979,
I was 99 years old, and my mom gave me
some medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: She had read about it in Good Housekeeping
magazine, which in America is pretty
[SPEAKER_12]: square, and she was sitting in a waiting
room one day, and said she read about the
[SPEAKER_12]: therapeutic effects of the marijuana,
and she just decided to try it,
[SPEAKER_12]: because at that point, I had had tumors
nine times between ages two and ten,
[SPEAKER_12]: and my mother was just at a loss of things
to do, and she decided to talk to my
[SPEAKER_12]: doctor about it, and he was also at a
point of feeling like there wasn't much to
[SPEAKER_12]: lose, because I had a tumor in my soft
tissue between my left lung and my heart,
[SPEAKER_12]: and they figured, why not?
[SPEAKER_12]: So we started using it after I was
pregnant, and it was quite profound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interestingly, interestingly,
interestingly, interestingly enough,
[SPEAKER_04]: quite recently, I believe, two years ago
something, there was a big story in the
[SPEAKER_04]: United States, of a child, a sick child,
the parents had tried to get marijuana in
[SPEAKER_04]: their state for a while, and they got into
trouble with these brothers in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it became a big affair, because a
journalist that used to be anti,
[SPEAKER_04]: or swapped during this time, it's true,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: What you're speaking of is a CNN
journalist, Sanjay Gupta, he did an
[SPEAKER_12]: episode called Plead, which I find mildly
offensive.
[SPEAKER_12]: He made a conversion, he actually wrote an
editorial against Proposition 19,
[SPEAKER_12]: which was a ballot initiative which would
have legalized cannabis in California,
[SPEAKER_12]: and what they did was, somehow he tuned
into what we would have been talking about
[SPEAKER_12]: for many a decade now, and had a real
turnaround, and he did a CNN special that
[SPEAKER_12]: was seen by very many people, and when
this family saw it, it caused a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: people to realize that some of these
children who were dealing with intense
[SPEAKER_12]: seizure disorders are benefiting from CBD,
now the DIAL.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD, everybody knows what this is?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now there's been a refocus on this,
because now they're starting to look at
[SPEAKER_12]: children in these disorders, if you will,
and the children are a pure test subject.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I was nine years old, I had no
politics, I just wanted to feel better,
[SPEAKER_12]: and it helped.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you get this book out of the bag?
[SPEAKER_12]: 20 years ago, I walked off the boat,
so to speak, came on the airplane with
Jack Herrer, Jack Herrer wrote the book
The Effort of the Flows.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Effort, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and after he passed away,
I released the 12th edition of his book,
[SPEAKER_12]: because I've been an editor of it since
1994.
[SPEAKER_12]: We redesigned it in 1998.
[SPEAKER_12]: I grew the leaf that's on the cover,
it's one of your sense of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the equism of this book?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, every time we republished a book,
we would recompile it with updated
[SPEAKER_12]: information, so every edition of the book
was reinvented if you will, so based on
[SPEAKER_12]: the history that we knew, and then trying
to bring it current with what we've seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your current?
[SPEAKER_12]: My latest project was called The Culture
High, we just released a film.
[SPEAKER_12]: It took five years to work on,
Ben has featured in it, guest Richard
[SPEAKER_12]: Branson's in it, Snoop Dogg's in it,
Wiz Khalifa's in it, Joe Rosen's in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where can we see it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Richard Branson launched our trailer
for us on his Virgin blog, October 1st,
[SPEAKER_12]: and we are worldwide on Vimeo.
[SPEAKER_12]: We just hit number three on iTunes in the
documentary section three weeks after it
[SPEAKER_12]: released.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were just accepted by the Academy
Award for a potential Oscar.
We're not PBS.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm not, you go look it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, it's true.
[SPEAKER_12]: Brett Harvey is our director.
[SPEAKER_12]: We also did another movie called The
Culture High.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was in prison for five years too.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I got out of prison, I was just
as pissed off as Mark, so I decided to
[SPEAKER_12]: produce very large educational events,
movies, and such.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, who has spent most years in
prison, all of you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: He got the longest sentence.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we roll tape, please?
[SPEAKER_04]: For who?
[SPEAKER_04]: For what?
[SPEAKER_04]: What words?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you please roll tape?
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to know what tape.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one, which is Morgan Jones.
[SPEAKER_02]: The name is Mark Emery, and he's called
the Prince of Cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Emery, founder of the BC Marijuana
Company, publisher of Canada's Culture
[SPEAKER_00]: Magazine, and lifelong activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said I'm responsible for one million
pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: versus Mark Emery.
Let me assure you, if you, the Canadian
people, allow me to be extradited,
[SPEAKER_02]: you will never see me alive again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Emery was jailed for five years for
selling marijuana seeds to American
[SPEAKER_06]: customers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark is free!
Mark is free!
Mark is free!
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, adios.
And how are you extradited?
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark and I met 19 years ago when you came
to the Canada stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Was 95 your first couple?
[SPEAKER_12]: 94 and 96.
[SPEAKER_12]: 94 then.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, then our first year was 20 years
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you then already also on the part of
medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you already interested in that field?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I came here in 1994, it was in Canada
in 1990, when I started, there was
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried to find a book that taught,
later it became involved with the Emperor
[SPEAKER_02]: Wears No Flows, the 1990 edition by Jack
Graham, who's probably one of the more
[SPEAKER_02]: profound influences in my lifelong and
family and some others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this book was banned in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't get, and then I knew it,
it was banned in Canada, and High Times
[SPEAKER_02]: Magazine was banned in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything about marijuana was no longer
allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We only have it on Mayan cotton,
which is banned.
[SPEAKER_04]: The book is for Hitler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, there was something we
didn't get.
[SPEAKER_02]: A fine of $100,000 to distribute a book
about marijuana or a magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it had scared everybody, and no one did
it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I came here, it was after we had
broken this ban, when we had reintroduced
[SPEAKER_02]: to Canada the books by Jack Graham of the
magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we brought back pipes and bongs
and gave it a political cover and
[SPEAKER_02]: reintroduced everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I came here 20 years ago,
I was inspired to add seeds because we
[SPEAKER_02]: needed to raise millions of dollars to
give it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So subsequently, for 10 years,
we gave away all our profits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to give $5 million to all
these actors, groups, and ballot
[SPEAKER_02]: initiatives in the US, political parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sued the US federal government.
[SPEAKER_02]: We paid for ballots and did some signature
drives.
[SPEAKER_02]: We formed political parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And throughout Canada, we gave money to
the Israeli Green New Party, the New
[SPEAKER_02]: Zealand Cannabis Party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any place we could change the financial
system with our money, I was excited to do
it.
I can't believe to this day that a
Canadian was able to give money to get
medical marijuana from Washington DC,
from Colorado in 2000, and even Arizona
the same year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to use that money to get things
on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was just the most awesome
thing ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: During his imprisonment, you became the
spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten years ago, I moved to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got involved with Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the year following, in 2005,
was when the US government came into
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as he was arrested and facing 30 years
of mandatory minimums to life in US
[SPEAKER_05]: prison, he accepted the five-year plea
deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you understand why.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in his absence, yes, I had to run our
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Canada's Culture magazine,
which Mark started as a marijuana and
[SPEAKER_05]: health newsletter, printed on him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Plot TV, which is a video news
network, which he started as one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: first video websites ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in his absence, I was looked to
comment on marijuana because I run for
[SPEAKER_05]: office with the marijuana party in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I run with the DC Green Party.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm seeking the candidacy for the
Liberal Party of Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,
OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us don't trust the government.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't trust the establishment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it makes sense that you wouldn't
because they've been the oppressors.
[SPEAKER_05]: The drug war and prohibition have been
created by the people with power.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the police, the politicians,
the government.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have oppressed the marijuana
people and the marijuana growers for so
[SPEAKER_05]: many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in our activism, even before my time,
activists just said, legalize it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legalize it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop arresting people for pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in order to stop arresting people for
pot, you need to get the arrestors to stop
[SPEAKER_05]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to convince them.
[SPEAKER_05]: To see it our way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's difficult to trust the people who
have worked against us, the people who put
[SPEAKER_05]: us in prison, the people who have created
the laws that have destroyed so many
[SPEAKER_05]: lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to trust them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you've got to work with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say that as scummy and corrupt
and unjust and evil as government and
[SPEAKER_05]: politicians and all of that can be,
they do govern our lives, whether we like
[SPEAKER_05]: it or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're going to go with us and
legalize it in the form they have in
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado or the form they have in Uruguay
or even this Amsterdam type of
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization they referred to for years,
whatever model it is, we have to be the
[SPEAKER_05]: ones to go to the oppressors, to go to the
powerful ones and say, do it this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it with the consciousness of medical
marijuana, of hemp, of the industrial
[SPEAKER_05]: purposes, of the jobs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it from these perspectives.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we, as the activists, say we don't
trust them and we don't want to work with
[SPEAKER_05]: them, they will go seek others to work
with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we must be the ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they're going to accept me and I can
run for office and get into the government
[SPEAKER_05]: of Canada and help the Liberal Party
follow through on their promise to
[SPEAKER_05]: legalize, I would do my utmost to make
sure it's the best legalization in the
[SPEAKER_05]: world so that America and Obama and
everyone else can say Canada's pretty big,
[SPEAKER_05]: they've got it going on, let's do it that
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can have hemp and everything else
involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do the dirty work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which again, the Liberal Party of Canada
The Liberal Party in the world is amongst,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say, the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to talk in terms of enemies,
the VJD is, strangely enough, which the
[SPEAKER_04]: Liberal Party is against every kind of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's make a quick note about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: These titles of Liberal, Democrat,
Left, Right, Conservative, we have to work
[SPEAKER_05]: with them all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ending Prohibition is non-partisan.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Republicans and Conservatives can see
it from a liberty and financial
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective, and the Socialists and the
Left wing can see it as a freedom and
[SPEAKER_05]: togetherness issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody has their own approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially, remember, people who don't
smoke who agree with us, like Dr. Sanjay
[SPEAKER_05]: Bhutta, they're going to help us win.
[SPEAKER_05]: So keep talking, keep networking,
and never turn away from anyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to want pot to be illegal,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought people who smoke pot should
go to prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point is,
[SPEAKER_05]: I started out in high school, I didn't
like marijuana, I didn't think people
[SPEAKER_05]: could use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt people should go to prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I slowly changed my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, you think marijuana should be legal
because it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how many of you also thought that
maybe hard drugs should stay illegal when
[SPEAKER_05]: you first became interested in pot?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people start with being pro-pot,
and then they learn that prohibition is a
[SPEAKER_05]: problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So never turn your back on someone who is
against you, because if they come around
[SPEAKER_05]: to your side, it's very valuable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark's prosecutor changed sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Julie, that was fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: He helped legalize it in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: His prosecutor is a legalizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: My prosecutor changed sides and wrote the
legislation for water on the stage in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2000.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just saying, work with everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace, love, and prosperity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not hearing anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to see the green guys now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The green guys.
Where are our green guys?
Well, you know what, you know what.
I'm religious, I'm racist, I'm racist,
I'm racist.
Baby,
do you want help tonight?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's not clear for everybody here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, please, please, please,
please, and have your attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some controversy in this country,
you must be aware.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have tradition, centralist tradition,
and apparently, well, it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a blackface tradition,
but the Dutch didn't consider it to be
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are now slowly awakening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interestingly enough, already,
in 2008, the Green Peas were born.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were far ahead of their time,
we may say.
[SPEAKER_04]: We even had a black center class in here,
a very famous television host.
[SPEAKER_04]: And seven years later, they are,
I don't know what you are now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are trendsetters.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, tonight in Trushinsky won a
very famous film premiere about this
[SPEAKER_04]: tradition, and it's gotta be a bomb,
this film.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I told them that they should go to
Trushinsky around 8.30, and set it front,
[SPEAKER_04]: because the whole world presses there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it may be, we'll help out your foot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so you have to go there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should all go there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and now, ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Beforewakes, former prize winner,
will hand out the first tenement sculpture
[SPEAKER_04]: award to the Queen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. McCormick, the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER_12]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know, it's been a great
pleasure, Mark, to actually be the one
[SPEAKER_12]: that actually hands you this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've admired your philanthropy and your
passion and your drive for decades,
[SPEAKER_12]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, there was a few of us,
I think, in that bus 20 years ago that
[SPEAKER_12]: realized that our voice meant something.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you were one of those people,
and, you know, the world could like or not
[SPEAKER_12]: yet something to say, and we all heard it,
and that message was great.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you, you know, from us all for
having the courage to sell seeds to places
[SPEAKER_12]: where we weren't allowed to sell seeds to,
and for taking the proceeds and not,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, buying yourself a space airplane
or a ticket to Mars, but instead trying to
[SPEAKER_12]: use it as a responsible resource to do
good deeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I admire that greatly, because in this
hippie-type movement where a lot of people
[SPEAKER_12]: looked at wealth as a burden and not a
blessing, you looked at it as a
[SPEAKER_12]: responsibility, and you redistributed it
in ways that a lot of people might not
[SPEAKER_12]: have done.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I forever am grateful to you for
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that maybe from being behind
the scenes and knowing the people that
[SPEAKER_12]: you've supported and the initiatives that
you've gotten behind, and the change that
[SPEAKER_12]: we have experienced in America was from
generous people like you, and from the
[SPEAKER_12]: bottom of my heart.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
And a big hug.
And talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to say something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
Talk, please.
[SPEAKER_12]: Five years that he was locked away as a
prisoner, you really did an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've run into you at all these different
rallies, Seattle Hemfest, and she was up
[SPEAKER_12]: there all the time pounding the pavement,
trying to get people to listen,
[SPEAKER_12]: and keeping the magazine going,
which has been a beacon of education.
[SPEAKER_12]: And really, that's what we're here for,
because we believe that we have a message
[SPEAKER_12]: that everybody else needs to hear.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in all honesty, I'm only hoping that
we inspire you to go carry the message to
[SPEAKER_12]: the people that we don't know,
to turn them on like we were turned on,
[SPEAKER_12]: so that we can all take over.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I joke that Timothy Leary had it only
two-thirds right, where he used to say,
[SPEAKER_12]: turn on, tune in, and drop out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really turn on, tune in, and as you
were saying, take over.
Because that's what we're all about as a
gang.
And we're not victims here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're really in control of our own
destiny.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we need more strong women like you in
this movement, and I admire you so much.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you for being so supportive of
Mark, and thank you for changing your
[SPEAKER_12]: mind.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't have liked you so much.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have many questions, but I hope I'll get
to that later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for you, Jody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there's still more stigma
surrounding women smoking than men?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's so much stigma,
but women have always been looked to as
[SPEAKER_05]: the nurturers, the caretakers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They give birth, they raise children,
the men help, it's a group effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think, in general, people ask why
are women underrepresented in the
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana movement, and I would say
there's a fair argument that they're
[SPEAKER_05]: underrepresented generally, but if you
make up half of...
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you could say it's a man's world,
but I tend to see everyone as an
[SPEAKER_05]: individual.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, every individual has their merits,
and there are men who stay at home and
[SPEAKER_05]: raise children, and there are women who
don't take care of kids, so you can't make
[SPEAKER_05]: these generalizations.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is fair to say that throughout
human history, women have taken care of
[SPEAKER_05]: the home while the men go out and do work
and gathering and whatever, or hunting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But even in terms of working, women are
only recently entered into the workforce,
[SPEAKER_05]: so women have been there to back the men
while they go out and do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even right now, today, there are a lot
of men in the movement who go out,
[SPEAKER_05]: and there are women who help take care of
home, but so many women are active these
[SPEAKER_05]: days.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many women are out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you want to go on Facebook or
any of these groups, women are very
[SPEAKER_05]: powerfully involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think there's so much
underrepresented as just... It's kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: the way the world has seen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Men seem to take more of the prominent
positions, but that was different.
[SPEAKER_04]: One question from Mr. Rolling Stone.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could live your life over again,
what would you do something different?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I probably wouldn't have started
PotTV if I knew it was going to cost me a
[SPEAKER_02]: million dollars over six years,
and make no revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it turns out to be a historically
really amazing thing to start in January
[SPEAKER_02]: 1st, 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are things I would do
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have spent every one of that five
million dollars I gave away on ballot
[SPEAKER_02]: issues instead of like a quarter million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ballot issues are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have used every five million
dollars if I had really realized the good
[SPEAKER_02]: that can come from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This prison, I think it's from the same
prison, basically handwriting.
[SPEAKER_04]: This prison can learn you any value lesson
in life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can actually ask a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, is there anything that the prison
brought to you, something positive?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you're a good person,
you'll be welcome anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meeting in four and a half years,
I have nothing bad to say about my
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play with incredible musicians
who taught me how to play.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were very kind to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rarely ever heard an unkind word spoken
to me in six prisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: The punishment is too severe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had no desire to get high in
that four and a half years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm in the present tense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really think much about any thing
beyond my own confines.
[SPEAKER_02]: The books I was reading, the magazines I
was reading, the correspondence I was
[SPEAKER_02]: writing, I was very much in the present
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't thinking about what I had done or
where I was going or what was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only in the present moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Allen, wait, we'll get to Mr. Allen
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, Mr. Allen also knows something
about prisons too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, like I said, you make a joke
about it, and I like the joke,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we could be all convicts, ex-gods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: The terrible irony of it is there's so
many people in prison still now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just met two beautiful young kids,
and they're going for 25 years or I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know what.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot give you the details,
but it's amazing that people go in prison,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's so many people in prison,
and we get out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was only busted more than 80 times,
and I didn't do more than six weeks of the
[SPEAKER_03]: longest.
[SPEAKER_03]: More than 80.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was in Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was lucky to do no more than six
weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's three weeks, and two weeks,
and five days, and ten days, and community
[SPEAKER_03]: service and all the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in other countries in the world,
people still go to prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look in the museum, you have strategy
lights on Mickey and Chris Conrad a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a tragedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it should be light, it should be stone
and high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an event.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we should be taking the seriousness of
our activism because there's people in
[SPEAKER_03]: jail there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they should be there for a plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the anger or the heart where
we come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what we do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Colorado and Washington, where we've
declared victories, no one's been let out
[SPEAKER_12]: of jail for any cannabis offenses in
either of those two states.
[SPEAKER_12]: And while it's nice that we feel like
we're not slaves anymore, we can't turn
[SPEAKER_12]: our backs to the people that are still
rotten in jail as slaves.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's really what I walked away from
prison realizing a lot of good people go
[SPEAKER_12]: to prison in America.
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got 25% of the world's prison
population.
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of those people are nonviolent
offenders that were just trying to get
[SPEAKER_12]: high because their high wasn't alcohol and
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_12]: Their high was one of the other drugs that
were not legal.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can't really stop trying to seek
equal rights until we've really released
[SPEAKER_12]: the people that have already been locked
up for things that shouldn't have been
[SPEAKER_12]: crimes in the first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get to that, Mr. Update,
Mr. Howard Marks is on his way.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's probably very close now, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: No?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can have a short break.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just want to ask you, because why
were you applying that he knows something
[SPEAKER_04]: about prison?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Cannabis Culture Award is not
about having fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the people who did something,
who give something, who give years of your
[SPEAKER_03]: life in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to admire the people who are
still there.
And we should get them out.
We should get them to change.
All right, now we go to Alan.
[SPEAKER_03]: He will tell you about why we got awards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan will later on hand out the prize,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: He will present the prize to Mr. Marks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for this confusion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you still working in any way,
in any field, are you connected to,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say, marijuana, but besides smoking
it these days?
[SPEAKER_04]: In many ways, I'm still connected to this
field, and I correspond with everybody
[SPEAKER_09]: here regularly.
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time,
I'm trying to still involve the youth
group.
That's where it all comes to, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are actually all children, you have six
children, are they all involved somewhere
[SPEAKER_04]: around here?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're all still here.
They're involved in, let's say,
in the business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she calls herself Algemeen Medewerker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but she's great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, because, yes, this is all my
doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So part of the museum, because we
reopened, we rebuilt, and Alan and my
[SPEAKER_13]: father, we literally spent days in this
museum filling the vitrinas.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was done by Ben and me and Alan,
Ravi and my brother.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Albert, so many people.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we thought of one question,
actually, for you, Alan, and you're
[SPEAKER_13]: forgetting about it, but I really would
like to know, what would be your most
[SPEAKER_13]: interesting finding in cannabis history?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm very curious to answer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Professor, please answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there was a question,
I heard it before, and it's very,
[SPEAKER_09]: very hard to answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many beautiful things about
this plant, and I think that the true
[SPEAKER_09]: answer is that the most beautiful thing is
the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that is what inspired us in all
these years to make this collection here
[SPEAKER_09]: and make the museum in Barcelona and
inspired us to start a hemp factory and
[SPEAKER_09]: start doing all these things that we are
doing today.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the most beautiful moment in
history or the most beautiful find?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's many.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you go through this museum,
or in Barcelona, there's so many items
[SPEAKER_09]: that have a story, you know, that you
would love to tell more and more to all
[SPEAKER_09]: the people that walk through here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's only so much you can explain
or show, and many things people don't see.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have, we know where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know the passion behind it,
and it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, if people are able,
if you're ever in Spain, in Barcelona,
[SPEAKER_09]: please visit the museum of cannabis.
I'd
[SPEAKER_05]: like to make a comment about the fact that
we are in a museum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, marijuana is in the news a lot right
now because legalization is happening
[SPEAKER_05]: politically, but we also know that
worldwide, particularly in North America,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a baby boom, there's an aging
population, and medical marijuana is
[SPEAKER_05]: becoming more and more popular as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once they stop arresting people,
once we're really done with that,
[SPEAKER_05]: once they look at it as a massive human
rights violation, and they start
[SPEAKER_05]: apologizing for it in some way,
people are going to say, tell us more
[SPEAKER_05]: about this plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us more about what it does,
because apparently it doesn't just make
[SPEAKER_05]: you feel better when you're sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also holds the cure for cancer and so
many ailments.
[SPEAKER_05]: It builds buildings that keep you warm in
the winter and cool in the summer,
[SPEAKER_05]: and remove pollution from the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: This plant does so much, and when people
find out how much it does, when they learn
[SPEAKER_05]: the history for the preservation of things
like pot TV, I'm glad you did pot TV,
[SPEAKER_05]: and through things like the museum,
when people come and they find the history
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's been preserved, they'll be
kind of upset that they were lied to.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what happened to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really upset I was lied to about
marijuana, and that's why I changed my
[SPEAKER_05]: mind into active, because they're ruining
lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say it causes cancer, and it cures
cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's so much ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: So places like this that hold our history,
our cannabis culture history, are valuable
[SPEAKER_05]: for hundreds of years to come because
they're going to say they put people in
[SPEAKER_05]: prison for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: They shot them for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: They ruined children's lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: The law is for this plant to look at what
it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: So make sure you do go look at what it
does, because I'm continuously blown away
[SPEAKER_05]: still.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know the weirdest marijuana fact in
existence, and I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a real change in tone,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from Michael Pollan's Botany of
Desire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the idea of where we get the modern
idea of the witch flying on a broom at St.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul in Halloween.
[SPEAKER_02]: It originates from the middle-aged
practice of healing women, known as
[SPEAKER_02]: witches sometimes, but here it's putting a
dildo before them and putting a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis resin on it and inserting it
right at the vagina, which is mucous
[SPEAKER_02]: membrane and very absorbent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they would call it a flying
ointment, and then they would have
[SPEAKER_02]: out-of-body experiences for several hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bring that up only to point out that
every time you see these children as
[SPEAKER_02]: witches, you don't have to explain.
[SPEAKER_04]: We propose a short break.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because he's on his way right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to make, because I have one
more nice thing that I would like my
[SPEAKER_13]: father, actually, to talk about.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is the hemp gallery not the museum?
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is the hemp gallery gallery?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is actually everything in the gallery for
sale?
[SPEAKER_13]: And is it a gallery?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it says so much also about our
politics.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to tell this?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to tell this?
[SPEAKER_13]: We are a gallery.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are a gallery.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do you want to share this?
Why do you want to share this?
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, because I think it's important.
It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about, what you mean is about what
sometimes we don't have to follow the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't bend the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I find five years to open the
museum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, maybe you don't have a clue what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me put it in this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: He would like to, you know, the museum
wasn't small.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a larger museum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Amsterdam now, the situation is
that you don't get permission.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why it's the open of the
gallery.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to gather them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not allowed to bring them to an
official museum.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's called a gallery.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can buy the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wouldn't try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't buy the stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You bend the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like we have a smoking
lounge, but it's in an office space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, is it possible maybe that it's not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make it into better now,
because we have to waste it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we do it into better now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Gabs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we get some wine up here as well?
[SPEAKER_13]: More beer.
[SPEAKER_10]: More dabs.
I'm ready.
Can everyone get a wine in here and feed
it here as well?
Yes, ma'am.
