[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to record right now,
and we're going to go live.
[SPEAKER_13]: This will be nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are a community, not an industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that as a starting point,
sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great conversation right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a community.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also an industry, but we are and
still are a community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we're going to just start now.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just went live and we just showed up,
so I'm going to copy this.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sharing the link.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for
joining us today.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are here for Hash Church 4.0 Episode 5,
and what an incredible crew of OGs we have
[SPEAKER_13]: in the room.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just right away, the early birds,
really, the five minutes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Valerie actually was even in the
chat at 8.20.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got an email saying Valerie went into
the Zoom chat.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, okay, she is ready to be a
part of this.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was exciting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to Etienne and to Wade and to
Skunkman Sam and Valerie Corral,
[SPEAKER_13]: who I actually met for the first time at
Skunkman Sam's apartment in Amsterdam many
[SPEAKER_13]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for a nice dinner.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Sam, for that introduction.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we are so many years later.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have a nice little chat.
[SPEAKER_13]: The other day when I was thinking about
what we were going to chat about,
[SPEAKER_13]: for whatever reason, it came to me that we
are not an industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are a community.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was sort of the conversation starting
point I thought that we would have this
[SPEAKER_13]: morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it will head in a whole variety of
directions, but yeah, we are not just an
industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are also a community.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of the people who are in the room
right now really have fought for that
[SPEAKER_13]: community more than most.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hats off to all of you with my new very
short haircut.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice to see you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a nice day in Amsterdam so many
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of the awakening, part of the
awakening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been going on a long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Greetings from Amsterdam, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure, Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice to connect with you in your
cute little hat.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a lot of us are community,
but I think the industry is usurping and
[SPEAKER_10]: growing stronger and stronger.
[SPEAKER_10]: Only some of those have community links,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, because that's any corporate state.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's my red hat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my Phrygian cap of freedom and liberty
going.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's corporations
sometimes talk about family, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly a conversation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things are changing in the world
that we live in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, corporations are driven by profit.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they don't profit, they cease to exist.
[SPEAKER_10]: Community doesn't have to profit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just has to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Valerie, you were the example early on
of those that fought strong, combined with
[SPEAKER_00]: patience, and fought hard to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were the leader to us that were the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were out there showing compassion,
and we wanted to reflect that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of us did and carried that
reflection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we're aware, that community was
overgrown, needless to say, by those
[SPEAKER_00]: profiteers who necessarily seem or have
the same ideals that you and others
[SPEAKER_00]: instilled in us in compassionate giving to
those that were less fortunate than us,
[SPEAKER_00]: that were able.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I probably would be just a few years
out of prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had it not been a community that we were
all part of, you know, when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: something that was driven by the fruit of
it came through the community itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: really recognizing that so many great
things happen with the effort of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people like this movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really joined a movement that
was already well and well ensconced in
[SPEAKER_01]: this in this our worldwide community,
you know, our worldwide cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community, marijuana,
we call the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just did pretty lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get to hang out with all of you on a
Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not only were you lucky,
you fought for that change and push for
[SPEAKER_00]: that change and worked at a which was most
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You worked at a local level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You worked within your region of your
state and everyone rallied around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they saw what you were doing and why
you were doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were little of us that were like,
no, what they're doing is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you were taking patients and making
sure that they contributed at one point or
[SPEAKER_00]: another to the growth processing or
harvesting of this plant, which was an
[SPEAKER_00]: example that many of us were not aware is
something that could be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you went there and you said,
no, this is how it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they mess with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fought back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when they tried to raid y'all,
people blocked the roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of real drama to the
history that a lot of people here have
[SPEAKER_00]: lived and you were a saint to us on a hill
showing us how to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, you would take us in
and you would say, okay, this is how it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing this wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be doing it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentored us as well and kicked us
in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're also humbled and thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd like to jump in and add to what
Jan was saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was the first time the feds
raided you, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had been living in San Francisco for a
number of years at that point and had kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of heard about your work, but was not
really aware of the extent and the
[SPEAKER_05]: compassion that you brought to that work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, the news coverage of that
event, that first bust that you
[SPEAKER_05]: experienced down there that Jan was just
referring to served as a model for my,
[SPEAKER_05]: I created a series of collectives and
co-ops that up till today, it's still the
[SPEAKER_05]: model that I work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_05]: You set a high standard that I'm deeply
grateful for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do it alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike worked with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't work together now, but it was all
built from the strength of many.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what really is one of the,
it's elemental.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's key to our conversation today,
community, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start our families that are our
first community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we build from there, relying on
each other and nobody co-opting,
[SPEAKER_01]: working cooperatively, but nobody
co-opting the ownership.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 30 years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really, it's wild to watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to see a lot of what's happened,
especially freeing the plant, freeing the
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, anything that's this inviting
and magical and has the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: create a lot of revenue is going to be
co-opted by the corporate state,
[SPEAKER_01]: by corporations, by industry, create an
industry around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, we live in a very commercial,
competitive, capitalistic world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with capitalism is that it,
you know, I say this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only measures profit in one way,
but there are many ways to measure profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the balance comes when we
begin to see beyond the narrow scope of
[SPEAKER_01]: financial profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that we realize that people's
happiness is part of that profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Profit people that work, people who
benefit from all of those things are
[SPEAKER_01]: profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they aren't necessarily
commercialized, but if we could,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if they, whatever, if it could
be figured a way to commercialize that,
[SPEAKER_01]: make money off of it, probably would work
better for an industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Nef said about that, that's just a,
that's one of the frailties of a
[SPEAKER_01]: one-dimensional system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's not a one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Communities like love, you've got to give
more than you take.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also the way you make healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: You give more than you take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You open your hand to give something
before you know it's full.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's interesting, Sam, you give more
than you take because capitalism is pretty
[SPEAKER_13]: much the opposite where you take more than
you give.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can definitely see those two
systems are at, I mean, cannabis has shown
[SPEAKER_13]: us so beautifully how those two systems
are at odds with one another, particularly
[SPEAKER_13]: because they removed cannabis for so long
from that system.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, legal profiteering and
capitalism and all of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, you know, many of us use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: I certainly, one of the first things I
learned about cannabis before I knew of
[SPEAKER_13]: its medicinal properties, before I knew of
all the magical things that it could do,
[SPEAKER_13]: what I noticed and that this was,
you know, I didn't realize at the time,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it was really because of the
prohibition of cannabis that it allowed me
[SPEAKER_13]: to remove myself from the slavery of a
wage job.
[SPEAKER_13]: I figured out cannabis in a very unique
way.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't trying to like, you know,
make money so badly or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what I figured out was like,
I figured out a way to monetize enjoying
[SPEAKER_13]: being with my friends by getting them
something that they seemed unable to find
[SPEAKER_13]: on their own, at least to the caliber of
which my olfactory was allowing me to find
[SPEAKER_13]: because I had this heightened sense of
smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I used that to go out and really
curate great cannabis and find people who
[SPEAKER_13]: took this plant a little more serious than
others.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was really my first experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, obviously I still have to join.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the time of my life and it slowly
moved into this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I can kind of monetize this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's a strange tension that we find
ourselves in now, especially with the
[SPEAKER_13]: situation here in Canada, with the
situation down in California, with so many
[SPEAKER_13]: lifelong people kind of getting pushed out
of this ability to use cannabis to
[SPEAKER_13]: monetize their life.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's sad.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really know how to feel about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't love the idea that it's just moved
over to a different group.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yet I understand that everything else in
the world is like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I find myself questioning it
constantly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like here I am in this legal regulatory
framework of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I remember what it was like.
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember my friends serving 10 plus
years in prison.
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember guns.
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember dogs being shot and children
being taken away.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I remember those things,
I think, well, it's way better than it
[SPEAKER_13]: was.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like it's way better than it was.
[SPEAKER_13]: But then I hang out with younger people
who are like, oh, they're taxing us this
[SPEAKER_13]: and they're doing this and they're
crushing our business.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's terrible too, but not quite to
the level of what a lot of the people in
[SPEAKER_13]: this room experience by being arrested for
basically being a habitual florist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and providing and taking that risk
by doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we always
realize that it wasn't just about money,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there had to be compassion and always
attach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That there were always going to be people
who could not afford cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that were going to be surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just got cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have to figure out how to deal
with regimen to get healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you hear about this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, again, it reminds us of that
human element.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still done one to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as much as I love going on Capitol
Hill a few weeks ago and trying to effect
[SPEAKER_00]: change at a national level, it still
requires that one-on-one somebody coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in and says, hi, I just found out I have
stage four breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where all of us here have been
involved because we weren't thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily about the money as much as
this human is hurting and needs help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have all found ourself healing
through the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of all took it upon ourselves
to then help and do what we can to risk
[SPEAKER_00]: our freedoms to help other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, this was still very much a
gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what Valerie was doing was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we as dispensaries were doing,
we didn't have the legal right and we had
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually work illegally to change the
laws at the state level so that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: finally be accepted and not necessarily
continue to be prosecuted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somewhere in that situation,
the compassion had been lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to do it at Berkeley Patients
Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still give away free cannabis every
week to those that have established the
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, as the industry has
grown, the compassion has shrunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to remind the industry of the
compassion that Valerie and others
[SPEAKER_00]: established and weighed for us to continue
to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as we know, the cancer rates have
gone from one in three to one in two in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past couple of decades, which means
there's going to be a long need for many
[SPEAKER_00]: decades for humans to require the need for
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone on here has made sure that is
a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am humbled and thankful to call you
family at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think one of the things that
we're looking at most assuredly is with
[SPEAKER_01]: the pharmaceutical industry's move toward
or absconding with, I'm going to say
[SPEAKER_01]: absconding with medical because when
cannabis is created into, it's not that it
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't a medicine, but when it's created
into a pharmaceutically owned medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: we won't be able to supply medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be practicing medicine without a
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea that, I mean, it will become
privatized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will become a commodity that physicians
have to approve.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be pharmaceuticalized and that will
involve insurance companies and
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll take even a step further away
from the idea of building community around
[SPEAKER_01]: need and service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's, you know,
it's one of the reasons we changed our
[SPEAKER_01]: name because medical marijuana is soon to
be something of the past as far as people
[SPEAKER_01]: supplying or offering from one to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not that we can't do it on the
down low, the way we probably all started,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know we did, we started on the
down low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And moving away from these industrializing
and pharmaceuticalizing, these things move
[SPEAKER_01]: us further away from the unity of building
family, of being present with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we aren't present with one
another, we miss the connection of each
[SPEAKER_01]: other's eyes, of observing one another's
suffering, of being able to lend a hand in
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever way that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someday it's going to be me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's, we're mortal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as we serve ourselves, as an
industry serves us, it's as important to
[SPEAKER_01]: serve each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's doing the job of service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has a commodity to sell if
you're in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the service industry is this huge
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, we just get kind of mucked
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In what we need in our needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Muted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're mute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Old friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's making my heart feel really full.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so incredibly wonderful to see you,
Wade, Valerie, Etienne, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a while as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, Marcus, all the love to you
all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for being here this
morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel super honored.
[SPEAKER_06]: And talking about compassion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that this is, this is where
the most important thing that we can
[SPEAKER_06]: really talk about in humanity,
what, no matter what corporation or what
[SPEAKER_06]: entity or what family or what religion or
what socioeconomic group that you're in.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about compassion,
we're talking about a very humanistic
[SPEAKER_06]: quality, just like what Valerie said,
this one-on-one and unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the big education, the big
pharma, they come in to try to take that
[SPEAKER_06]: away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we don't have compassion anymore,
we lose what it is that we came in here to
[SPEAKER_06]: begin with.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I know that I entered into
cannabis because of compassion from the
[SPEAKER_06]: very beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And although there's lots of different
sort of sharks along the way that want to
[SPEAKER_06]: take us out of compassion, you know,
I feel like when it is me and I am making
[SPEAKER_06]: those last breaths on my deathbed with my
friends around, I just want to know that I
[SPEAKER_06]: continued on with compassion because then,
you know, it's just not worth living my
[SPEAKER_06]: life, honestly, unless we're doing it in a
way that is connecting with other human
[SPEAKER_06]: beings in this wonderful, amazing
collective consciousness that we have that
[SPEAKER_06]: we often forget about the power of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost interesting that, you know,
modern medicine goes down to places like
[SPEAKER_07]: South America, places like the Amazon and
they go and they try and take those
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds out of the forest and makes a
synthetic version.
[SPEAKER_07]: They kind of do that to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like as a human population, we're like the
rainforest medicine makers of the people
[SPEAKER_07]: realm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they come into our people and
they try and fragment us and isolate us
[SPEAKER_07]: and isolate our things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just doesn't work as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So give thanks that there's still people
like us in the world and that they're
[SPEAKER_07]: still intact environments for us to learn
from.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, there's some people out
there that just don't go along with
[SPEAKER_07]: everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a positive thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to just say one thing just to
share with everybody this morning is that
[SPEAKER_06]: speaking of large corporations that are
trying their hardest to make things
[SPEAKER_06]: non-compassionate is that we got a letter,
Dragonfly Earth Medicine got a letter from
[SPEAKER_06]: the Environmental Protection Agency.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this would be our new tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: A cease and desist on Dragonfly Earth
Medicine because nettles, alfalfa and kelp
[SPEAKER_06]: are now going to be listed as a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you are to be using them in any
nutrient that's not a synthetic NPK,
[SPEAKER_06]: then you are to be registered with
pesticide EPA.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they told us that they've been
watching us for over two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said, if we use the word healthy,
biodynamic, anything having to do with
[SPEAKER_06]: plants well-being at all, then we're
stepping into the pesticide area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And fertilizer era.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to let you all know sort of
what Josh was saying is that they have
[SPEAKER_06]: taken all of our education that we've been
doing for the past couple of years and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're integrating it for self to own.
[SPEAKER_06]: So very interesting and very much so along
the lines of what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're dealing with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting through it because that's
what we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just another roadblock.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're really good at roadblocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's three o'clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Roadblock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's just, you know, we have
micronized herbs with bacteria found all
[SPEAKER_07]: over the earth and mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're actually trying to stop that
from going into people's farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Simply because going to a Wikipedia page,
as simple as that, and just saying,
[SPEAKER_07]: what does Nettles do in a garden
environment?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just copy what's online,
say off of Wikipedia, whether you'd want
[SPEAKER_07]: to do that or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm just talking about the simplicity
aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the danger of compelling speech.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you compel speech, you create a very,
very dangerous environment.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is compelling.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is compelling speech because now
they're controlling what is a pesticide
[SPEAKER_13]: and changing that language and moving the
goalposts and effecting and creating this
[SPEAKER_13]: obstacle for you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have zero doubt that the tension that
this creates will turn that obstacle into,
[SPEAKER_13]: well, you guys will turn that obstacle
into an opportunity because you're on the
[SPEAKER_13]: right side of this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're clearly on the wrong side of
this story for cutting you off.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what we're just going to say is
that it just goes along with this long
[SPEAKER_06]: line of the people and the community
continuing in compassion and them finding
[SPEAKER_06]: out that that's a popular game over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_06]: They find out that togetherness is a
popular game and they want to own it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we know that love will win because if
there's only love and fear, we're really
[SPEAKER_06]: interested in staying in love and we'll
just let them define and take care of
[SPEAKER_06]: fear.
[SPEAKER_06]: And pretty soon they're going to tell us
that love needs to be listed under as a
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticide as well because health and
biodynamics and everything is,
[SPEAKER_06]: but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: The positive thinking thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no statistics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then actually, just like you said,
Marcus, as soon as we got it, it was an
[SPEAKER_06]: incredible opportunity for us to look at
all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really have taken it on as an
unbelievable opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I had said before, we've been
moving into plant medicine and I've been
[SPEAKER_06]: doing a lot of therapy sessions with
people that have been absolutely mind
[SPEAKER_06]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, wow, the healing that can happen
with plants is we all know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now that we're stepping into
something, yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Giving thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's given us opportunity to look at
other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And cannabis has opened the door for all
of the other plant medicines and all of
[SPEAKER_06]: the entheogens.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as she opens up the door, we all just
need to walk through and remember that
[SPEAKER_07]: love guides the way energy never goes
away.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just moves to another area.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to mention, too,
that I do not believe that all
[SPEAKER_10]: corporations intrinsically are evil.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, a lot of them certainly are the
sharks, but you got to remember that some
[SPEAKER_10]: of the corporations like the owner of
Patagonia, he gave his entire company and
[SPEAKER_10]: fortune to help companies that will fight
climate change and help sustainability.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, yeah, good things can be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking about corporations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about like public ones that
are associated with big government.
[SPEAKER_06]: Associated with lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we're talking about a corporation
like Patagonia, they do not have
[SPEAKER_06]: lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not have people that are trying to
continue to talk about how they can shut
[SPEAKER_06]: down people so they can make their way up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a B Corp or Patagonia is a B Corp and
they're principled in a different
[SPEAKER_01]: foundation.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you could be a B Corp and not
really be principled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's endemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the new conquering, the way that one
culture is conquered by another,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you tear down the temple and build
the church.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that's not too vague of a metaphor,
but I see this is happening in many
[SPEAKER_01]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's happening with plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we're science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to be able to have access to
scientific data and information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel very fortunate to live in a
time when I am able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also see that one of the issues that
appears to be arising is, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dismissal or the removal of the shaman
or the teacher from the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a medicine or we have a claim
and a claim that we associate with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, how did it even
become?
[SPEAKER_01]: How was it even discovered that it was a
medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't in a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was through messaging from the plant
connection with nature and that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: exquisite opportunity that we have to be
to deeply listen and be taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I get confused sometimes thinking
that I'm teaching something when really
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just listening and being able to hear
what I'm being able to listen more deeply
[SPEAKER_01]: and listen to some truth, some
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's really a danger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more than co-opting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have a goal, if you go toward
the goal, the things that are in your way
[SPEAKER_01]: can be pushed aside or will be pushed
aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to look at that in our own
lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we reflect on the ways that it is
happening around us, we're, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're oppressing our own planet at a great
cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think evolving such as we started off,
we could not be we had to all be not for
[SPEAKER_00]: profits, but we could not get that
[SPEAKER_02]: corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a full vetting cycle that is
making sure that you have diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you hire diversity, you're paying fairly
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's even in the corporate world,
there are things like beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: corporations, which are the standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we lost that when the government
forcefully evicted us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to lay off 50 people, therefore
putting us below that 70 or 75 person
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold they needed to have beneficial
corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also shows the need that even in
the new beneficial corporation,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are even limits that there need to
lower to be more accessible to everyone,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I would love to continue to still
be, but I due to the industry itself and
[SPEAKER_00]: its collapse, I can no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, Valerie, you led by example,
and everybody kind of went away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried to lead by example by still
compassionate giving and people have gone
[SPEAKER_00]: completely away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have to be the stewards and
reminders to people that the job is not
[SPEAKER_00]: done and there is still much more work to
do.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the division that human beings
tend to create naturally can be really
[SPEAKER_13]: viewed at both ends of life in the birth
and in the death of a human being.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you look at that, you know,
when Valerie's talking about connection
[SPEAKER_13]: and how this connection has been lost in
the pharmaceuticalization of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_13]: we'll look at the pharmaceuticalization of
birth and the lack of connection that's
[SPEAKER_13]: there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, very important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_13]: A hospital is an amazing place to be able
to be an emergency room for something
[SPEAKER_13]: that's going wrong with the mother or the
baby.
[SPEAKER_13]: But just that disconnect of how different
it is when you have a home birth with a
[SPEAKER_13]: midwife and you have that eye to eye
connection and you don't have anyone sort
[SPEAKER_13]: of controlling the other person and trying
to be like, I'm the guy here that's doing
[SPEAKER_13]: this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you see it in the way we die as well
and the way people die in hospital beds
[SPEAKER_13]: versus, you know, having death gatherings
where people are actually taking you
[SPEAKER_13]: through your death.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you can see how it affects
everything in between.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure, you know, there's always
this tension.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I somehow think that it's part of the
human experience because we're not here to
[SPEAKER_13]: be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're here to have our free will and to
have these experiences, both sides of the
[SPEAKER_13]: coin have to exist.
[SPEAKER_13]: And in that tension, and I don't really
know how to put this into words,
[SPEAKER_13]: but I feel that the value of life can be
found in that tension.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the tension between life and
death, the tension between one person's
[SPEAKER_13]: vision versus another person's vision.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure Dr. Mark, you could get into
metaphors of chemistry and how all sorts
[SPEAKER_13]: of magic happens in the tension of
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, it's a really interesting thing
how we're constantly creating division
[SPEAKER_13]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, oh, this side wants to do it
this way.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we want to do it this way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, Josh sort of spoke upon it
earlier.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good that we exist, but, you know,
in the words of one of my neighbors,
[SPEAKER_13]: Heather, this 80 plus year old woman,
she said, well, it's all love,
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all love.
[SPEAKER_13]: So don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all love on both sides.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even the side that you think isn't love,
it's love too, just from a different
[SPEAKER_13]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's my sort of flaky love.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus, I love that because I feel like
also what's happening with, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: what happened with cannabis, we saw that
anything that has a nature connection is
[SPEAKER_06]: something that can be looked at and can be
attacked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Science is definitely very helpful,
but unfortunately, science likes to say
[SPEAKER_06]: that it's more important than nature
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Science likes to say, hey, I've got it
more figured out even than nature does.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas nature never goes back and says,
oh, that was the wrong experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we didn't have it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But science is always redoing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, 10 years later, that wasn't totally
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not going to throw the baby out
with the bath water because I feel like
[SPEAKER_06]: science is really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel like we're going more towards
the technical side of science,
[SPEAKER_06]: more the mechanism side of science and
demonizing a lot of what nature has to
[SPEAKER_06]: show us and nature has to guide us.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that's becoming incredibly
apparent with that is while I think that
[SPEAKER_06]: MAPS is incredibly helpful in pushing
forward plant medicine and what they're
[SPEAKER_06]: doing, I'm also incredibly concerned
because it's taking a lot of the science
[SPEAKER_06]: side of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you go into an office, you put
something over your eyes, you listen to a
[SPEAKER_06]: certain music, you have this incredible,
which people say is, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like a near death experience or like a
birth experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's that life changing that then you
take the mask off and you go to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next day, nature is not involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the second and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, go ahead, Val.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever our experience that awakens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to back up the thing with
MAPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It likes in order to bring these
experiences to people, there are certain
[SPEAKER_01]: safeguards within the context of the
scientific community and they're there for
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the way are they've socially been
built.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't doesn't in any way change our
experiences with psychedelics or we still
[SPEAKER_01]: have those opportunities to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see why that, you know, I think we
can all see why there are problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody might, you know, flip out,
have a bad experience, may have a heart
[SPEAKER_01]: attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: These kinds of things can rarely but they
can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guidance is a really important tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the teacher, the connection between
the shaman or the guide and the intention
[SPEAKER_01]: of our journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's true with everything,
you know, like I'm I'm sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, did anybody get not anybody,
but I working with people in in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, did they ever get high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, did they what happened to
the experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to that piece that changed
us or opened our hearts or or you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is it that that we lose when we walk
away from the experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we walk away from an experience
that lasts for an instant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It opens or changes us in some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then what what do we take with us from
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see that that's that's just part of
the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does not in any way change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the need for science, science is
going to take it to people that we you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, in Dubai, it's going to take it to
people all around the world that would not
[SPEAKER_01]: in no other way have an opportunity or may
not have another.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do totally agree with you, Val.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's a really important part.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the concern that I have in
this is that these are plants that come
[SPEAKER_06]: from nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a message of nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what therapy or the men is only
another human being.
[SPEAKER_06]: Taking nature out of the factor as a
mentor, as a teacher.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you when I work with people and I'm
working on plant medicine, I could have
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody for a half an hour looking at a
leaf and downloading nature and
[SPEAKER_06]: downloading what it feels like to lie on
the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just I have a concern that if we
take nature out of the picture as nature,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, as as a mentor in this,
as a teacher, as an expansive knowledge,
[SPEAKER_06]: then we're only looking towards another
human being who is incredibly limited.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like that's where the clinical
setting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it may bring it to more people,
but I feel like it's lacking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like if we could at least go to
where the plants are grown in the ground
[SPEAKER_06]: and get out of the clinical setting,
maybe we need to bring the clinicians out
[SPEAKER_06]: to nature more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something has got to happen where nature
is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in some ways, sometimes I go
through a whole six hour plant medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: therapy session with somebody and we don't
talk at all because nature is downloading
[SPEAKER_06]: everything that that person needs to do by
just simply going on a walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel that if we're going to juice
people up with plant medicine and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to go to these incredible
psychedelic spaces and they're going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: really looking at why they're here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to look be looking at their
soul path.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have an understanding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like if nature is not involved in
that conversation and that guidance,
[SPEAKER_06]: then that person is severely missing out
on the potential possibilities of where
[SPEAKER_06]: they could where they could go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're out on that possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not one doesn't negate the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not everybody would be comfortable
laying on the ground in the forest and not
[SPEAKER_01]: not everybody can access it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody who's paralyzed is going to have
a hard time doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People won't necessarily people who are
sick who can't get out of bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what I'm trying to say is I fully
agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are eight billion of us and or
so and and there are eight billion ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: leave behind whatever it was and open to a
new path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's one of our one of
the things we want to do is to stay open
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay open to the other pathways,
because what I think is happening is that
[SPEAKER_01]: door is getting shut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, lots of people are taking off and
doing ayahuasca journeys and connecting
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you know, it's remarkable what's
happening today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really quite remarkable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And does it have to be in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think there are great grave
issues that arise when we remove the
[SPEAKER_01]: teachers, remove the shamans, when we take
the take the institutionalized the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: gift, the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the more the more pathways we
open, the more opportunities for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the experience, to carry it,
to carry both their intention and the
[SPEAKER_01]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only broadens and it broadens our
language and it broadens our connection
[SPEAKER_01]: with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives a chance, you know,
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: How how amazing can we be?
Well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in traffic and see how amazing you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it you know, what we take
from our experience and what we give,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the room for others to have their
experience is one of the keys that I hope
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't erase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we don't miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I would fully agree with you
that that's the remarkable healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your people are very fortunate to be
able to be in your in your service with
[SPEAKER_01]: your with you serving their needs and
attending to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very sweet and beautiful gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not everybody can get to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really don't want everybody to get
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't think that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a small community because I can
have I can be more at peace with who I
[SPEAKER_01]: serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and it is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to reach everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the people that we are reaching now
are the people who are working with other
[SPEAKER_06]: people to give them another look at what a
healing session can look like,
[SPEAKER_06]: what it feels like outside of walls,
what it feels like without, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: something over your eyes and just being
internal and gathering what nature has to
[SPEAKER_06]: offer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is changing the way that they're
looking at their sessions is changing the
[SPEAKER_06]: way that they are making their clinics and
it is changing the way that they're seeing
[SPEAKER_06]: patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, the more that we can have
influencers and people that are working
[SPEAKER_06]: with other people understand the power of
the mentorship of nature and the power of
[SPEAKER_06]: nature as the shaman, then I think that
we've got a much better opportunity to
[SPEAKER_06]: reach those, you know, 80 million people
on the planet or whatever, eight billion
[SPEAKER_06]: people on the planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're eight billion versions of nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're eight billion versions of evolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not eight billion versions of Petri
dishes, but we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, because we are nature is science.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we take it back, think of this.
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, you guys might be forgetting
how savage nature is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know that the wildebeests in Africa
give birth twice?
[SPEAKER_13]: First, they give birth for the lions to
consume their babies live as they're
[SPEAKER_13]: coming out of the vaginas of the
wildebeests live.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the most savage thing you've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they give birth a couple of
months later.
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are the ones that actually
succeed the bloodline of the wildebeests
[SPEAKER_13]: because the lions damn near consume all of
the first born of these wildebeests.
[SPEAKER_13]: So science, our ability to create and
discover has allowed us to remove
[SPEAKER_13]: ourselves from the food chain.
[SPEAKER_13]: We used to be a part of that food chain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let me tell you, it was super savage.
[SPEAKER_13]: You cannot imagine.
[SPEAKER_13]: We thought it was bad when the DEA were
hunting us down with guns.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was worse when lions and tigers were
hunting us down with their teeth and
[SPEAKER_13]: eating us alive.
[SPEAKER_13]: Forget about putting you in a cage.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were just consuming you whole.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we're in all nature, well then our
science is a part of nature as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Think about the ability to even use the
medicine you guys are using for healing
[SPEAKER_13]: right now without science.
[SPEAKER_13]: Science created that medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: The tools of science helped transform
nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not diminishing nature by science or
nature by any means.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to say basically that
like mycelium grows in an isopropyl hooded
[SPEAKER_07]: stainless steel environment that shows
that nature lives in all environments.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can all be enhanced or gifted by every
part of life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's invited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Life is amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we have fractals and the
Mandelbrot theory and all these things
[SPEAKER_07]: that show that there's a never ending
possibility.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love connecting with nature whenever
possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and I also think that the
conversation of the wildebeest eating us
[SPEAKER_06]: with their big teeth, that's nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: But human beings that are sort of killing
each other to become a higher position.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like maybe that's a little bit out
of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just it feels like competition has
taken over natural intuition.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that we are out of balance
with science being looked at more as the
[SPEAKER_06]: thing rather than I think we're just a
little bit out of balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think nature is equally as important as
science because we've created and we're
[SPEAKER_06]: natural beings.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, science has just
taken the main news.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the front page.
[SPEAKER_06]: Science, science, science.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people are forgetting that we can learn
so much from nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're just trying to continue to be a
loud voice for nature because science has
[SPEAKER_06]: such a main spot right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Science is the study of nature.
[SPEAKER_13]: Science is the study of nature.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't have it without nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: We study the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're part of the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cannabis plant doesn't express the
same type of diversity and its
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids synthetically as it does
organically in a regenerative setting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would everyone be going into the earth
with their cannabis, not just because the
[SPEAKER_07]: bills are high and an indoor setting,
the cannabis is different when it grows in
[SPEAKER_07]: the soil with rocks and crystals and
spring water and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That plant's different, complete different
plant than an aeroponic setup or a
[SPEAKER_07]: hydroponic setup.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to know anything else at that
point.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like a plant, 22,000 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's very little different between us.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, by saying that it's not trying
to say that a hundred percent we're from
[SPEAKER_07]: nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: We use electricity.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like, it's nice to not have to go
down the rabbit hole of like, well,
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what about this and that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything else is happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just odd in the last three years that
the nature side of life has been
[SPEAKER_07]: demonized.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the way it is ostracized,
witch hunt, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't travel, can't live.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not an actual equal playing field.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of, it's kind of just,
sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's hear, let's hear from a scientist,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we all think you want me to speak,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: The universe is perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: I truly, truly believe this and any people
who can't see it, you know, I,
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I feel sorry for you, but the universe
is truly perfect.
[SPEAKER_13]: But Sam, how much acid did you take to see
that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it like a hundred hits, like 200 hits?
[SPEAKER_10]: It was only 50 hits.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I know, I know this was an acid
trip.
[SPEAKER_12]: For him to come to the conclusion that
it's perfect, he's on the assumption that
[SPEAKER_12]: the universe is finite.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we know anything from Einstein,
we know that the universe is ever
[SPEAKER_12]: expanding.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, uh, uh, I would quote,
uh, Einstein and saying that my sense of
[SPEAKER_12]: God is my sense of wonder about the
universe.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let me just chime in from the science
point of view for a second and say,
[SPEAKER_12]: well, okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: The science is it Marcus science of living
things, science of nature is biology.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's all other kinds of disciplines and
science, but it's so think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_12]: So humans are naturally inquisitive,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to learn about ourselves and our
environment.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're all scientists, but we're not all
paid scientists.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just, there's a few of us who are paid.
[SPEAKER_12]: The rest of you, we're all scientists and
we're all building on the knowledge that
[SPEAKER_12]: we all stand on the shoulders of the
people who come before us.
[SPEAKER_12]: That have led us down this path.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so let me go back to the EPA for a
second too.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's interesting that you guys got a
notification from them, but remember that
[SPEAKER_12]: theoretically the EPA, which was started,
um, uh, in 1970 by the Nixon
[SPEAKER_12]: administration, uh, was there to basically
protect the environment, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And make sure that, you know, people
weren't just making really big piles of
[SPEAKER_12]: waste for pollution.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or somehow damaging the environment where
yes, like it or not, food is grown in
[SPEAKER_12]: industrial ways and the environmental
protection agency makes sure that,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, things that are sold into
agriculture have no, uh, long lasting
[SPEAKER_12]: impact in the environment.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, while it's true that like what
you, the sort of like the living soil
[SPEAKER_12]: approach is, is less.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, impactful on the environment as taking
advantage of the natural organisms and
[SPEAKER_12]: using mother nature's own bio pesticides,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, you know, the EPA for several
years now has had a category called bio
[SPEAKER_12]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you look at the various
regulations, um, there are, there are no
[SPEAKER_12]: commercial products right now,
uh, whose registration covers the use on
[SPEAKER_12]: hemp or cannabis or very, very few.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason why is because the onus is
back on the people who own that
[SPEAKER_12]: registration for that active to run all of
the trials to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_12]: application rate of their product on that
agricultural product, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_12]: doesn't have to be cannabis could be
anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tomatoes, strawberries, anything,
whatever you're applying to that has the
[SPEAKER_12]: efficacy that you claim it does.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it kills fungus or keeps insects away
or whatever, but it also has to be shown
[SPEAKER_12]: to be safe by the time that produce gets
to the market that, you know, either it's
[SPEAKER_12]: been photo litically or hydro litically,
uh, decomposed to the point where whatever
[SPEAKER_12]: metabolites from that treatment that's
left on those strawberries or string beans
[SPEAKER_12]: or lettuce is all below the point at which
there is no effect on human health.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there is effect on human health,
they don't get a registration in that
[SPEAKER_12]: market.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, so now add cannabis to this.
[SPEAKER_12]: So in order for a company to show,
to get an EPA registration on anything
[SPEAKER_12]: from insecticide, fungicide, anything that
you want to apply to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_12]: you'll have to have that data package.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll have to have that data package to
bring to the EPA.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now you're bringing, you know,
uh, regardless of cannabis being,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, I guess, federally illegal,
I guess, right now that's up for debate
[SPEAKER_12]: since, you know, hemp is now been made
legal through the, through, or low THC
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis, which is industrial hemp has now
been made legal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And certainly there are companies that are
going after that market, meaning that they
[SPEAKER_12]: are developing crop protection chemicals.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you'll be happy to know you guys that
again, you guys have been pioneers in this
[SPEAKER_12]: area and that people are taking your lead,
but now again, it's a business.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're investing millions into developing
that safety package and to know that when
[SPEAKER_12]: you brew that tea or when you use that
living soil product on cannabis at that
[SPEAKER_12]: rate, that it doesn't affect, there's no
residuals.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no runoffs that poisons,
you know, water supplies.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they go through this whole
environmental analysis and that's what the
[SPEAKER_12]: EPA is supposed to do, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's environmental protection agency.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're there using our tax dollars to
supposedly protect our environment.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not just coming down as being pro
EPA.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'm saying is that we, and you guys,
especially need to, we need to work with
[SPEAKER_12]: them so they can properly regulate the use
of these products in commercially grown
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause let's face it or not, I mean,
you guys were talking about corporations
[SPEAKER_12]: before.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know Sam has dealt with large
corporations.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've dealt with large corporations.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how I built my resume and got all
those things on the wall.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, ultimately at the end of the day,
this is a money-making business where
[SPEAKER_12]: people are in the business to basically
make a profit and either return that
[SPEAKER_12]: profit to their shareholders or their
investors or whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's just corporations.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just free enterprise and like it or
not, that's what we got and we can't
[SPEAKER_12]: really do anything to stop it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you might as well just get used to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's big companies that provide
everything from the gasoline we put in our
[SPEAKER_12]: cars to the fast food hamburgers,
if that's what you choose to eat,
[SPEAKER_12]: everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: If there was a market for something and
something wants to be bought and Delta-8
[SPEAKER_12]: THC is a perfect example of this where
there's a market where cannabis is illegal
[SPEAKER_12]: in certain states.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what do they do?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I turn this CBD into something that
could get people high.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now you can go to websites or gas
stations or bodegas and get all kinds of
[SPEAKER_12]: products that are made outside the
regulatory framework that most cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: operations are having to live under.
[SPEAKER_12]: I say that I'm living in Vermont guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is new.
[SPEAKER_12]: We moved from Pennsylvania to Vermont and
Vermont went reckless.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was recreational yesterday.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the first time I lived in a state
that's turned from medical to
[SPEAKER_12]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got a big joint to smoke here on
camera so we could celebrate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's just really cool what's happening
up here.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of innovation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Vermont's kind of like the Humboldt of the
East, a lot of great growers, a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: really dank weed up here in these
mountains.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm living on Lake Champlain,
which is really kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: I look out and see sailboats go by.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: But just to go back to science,
just and I'll end there, is that,
[SPEAKER_12]: again, any time you learn something,
you're being a scientist.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you learn something new and you're
expanding your knowledge over something,
[SPEAKER_12]: it doesn't have to be scientific.
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be just a quicker way to get to
work.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or it could be, gee, if I stirred my
coffee more, it wouldn't be so sweet at
[SPEAKER_12]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just little realizations like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're learning new things.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you learn new things, you're
basically being a scientist.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're just explorers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those of us who are paid scientists have
to explore right at the current frontier
[SPEAKER_12]: on what's known and what's not known.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we all know people have been asking
for years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think part of my attraction here on
church has always been the science and the
[SPEAKER_12]: research.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, geez, what can we do to really push
this thing forward?
[SPEAKER_12]: Holy shit, folks, be careful what you wish
for.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what the end of prohibition looks
like.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm getting a faculty position here at the
university to study the use of
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoids to treat traumatic brain
injury.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I have to pinch myself to
understand that when we were out doing,
[SPEAKER_12]: smoking really dank California weed and
eating mushrooms on the parking lot out at
[SPEAKER_12]: the Grateful Dead shows that we were ahead
of our time back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those of us who followed the dead around,
I mean, it was just so fucking cool
[SPEAKER_12]: because that was just like this flash in
time that existed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we traversed this millennium,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think most of the people here,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have one kid born in one millennium,
another kid born in another one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was alive during Jerry Garcia's
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, really important for me anyway.
[SPEAKER_12]: So at the end of the day, we're all
scientists.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're all explorers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, there's nothing wrong with
being inquisitive and wanting to learn
[SPEAKER_12]: more about your environment or what you're
smoking or what you're growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that's really awesome,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that, you know, what you're saying
is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: And inquisitivity is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love you, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, as far as the EPA,
one thing that I did want to say is I
[SPEAKER_06]: think that we could entrust in more of
these overbinding sort of corporations or
[SPEAKER_06]: fractures of the government if their track
record was more accountable.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we look at the EPA, what they have
allowed in and what they have allowed in
[SPEAKER_06]: to our soils and what has happened to our
soils with their allocations and their
[SPEAKER_06]: licensing to me should not have the word
protection on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think what we continue to come down
to is they're supposedly protecting us,
[SPEAKER_06]: but their track record really doesn't show
that they've done a very good job.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I feel like we can bash pharmaceuticals
all we want, but there's life saving
[SPEAKER_12]: medication out there that's saving
people's lives every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm not bashing that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like it's really important.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pharmaceuticals and what, like you guys
were talking about the
[SPEAKER_12]: pharmaceuticalization.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's exactly what I'm working
on.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm working on trying to understand,
you know, there was a really important
[SPEAKER_12]: paper that was published a couple of weeks
ago that showed that cannabinoid acids.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think in particular, CBGA showed a
complete blocking of something called
[SPEAKER_12]: store-operated calcium influx,
which is a way that helper T cells turn on
[SPEAKER_12]: the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't get any press whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's an extremely important discovery
that basically says how cannabinoids work
[SPEAKER_12]: to control inflammation.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always just kind of like a black box.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they hit the cannabinoid receptors,
then there's downstream stuff that
[SPEAKER_12]: happens.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't really know.
[SPEAKER_12]: This group has figured it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: So to me, I read that paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've read that paper eight times.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just, I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so like, this is the current frontier.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is right where knowledge ends and
where we could start looking into the
[SPEAKER_12]: crystal ball on what could be.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you start looking at all these
ways that, you know, cannabinoids work on
[SPEAKER_12]: the body, I mean, there's no class of
compounds like that that have the safety
[SPEAKER_12]: in humans, the long-term, you know,
I mean, humans have been using cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if there was toxic, you know,
effects, we would have seen it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We would have documented it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yasmin Hurd's research at Mount Sinai in
New York is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_12]: What she has now shown, and this is all
very, very recent research, is that
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis use in adolescents affects the
distribution of gray to white mass matter
[SPEAKER_12]: as the brain matures.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can't say, well, okay,
yeah, you know, kids who smoke weed during
[SPEAKER_12]: those ages, they can, you know,
maybe have compromised, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_12]: intellectual capacity later on in life.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not really what they're saying,
but the endocannabinoid system and the
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoid receptors are so important
that you couldn't imagine that using lots
[SPEAKER_12]: of cannabis isn't going to somehow affect
it one way or another.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think her research is really
important to show that.
[SPEAKER_12]: The last thing I want to say is this whole
renaissance
[SPEAKER_12]: and what they're finding is that people
who are taking, again, very, very modest
[SPEAKER_12]: doses, six months later, they're still
showing efficacy in that treatment.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is just, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I applaud the scientific frontiers
in these areas which are moving faster and
[SPEAKER_12]: faster and faster as regulation changes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, that is driven by profit and the
almighty dollar.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, I can't fix that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think we can fix that on Hash
Church, but we can coexist in that system
[SPEAKER_12]: and make sure that your guys' knowledge is
passed on to these people who are regular.
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically there are products that are
going to come out that's going to mimic,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, what you guys do.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to be part of that discussion
and part of that regulation.
[SPEAKER_12]: People are going to do this.
[SPEAKER_12]: People are already doing this.
[SPEAKER_12]: People, everything along the value chain,
I know AT&T has seen it for years.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can make it and you can sell it
into the cannabis industry, it's going to
[SPEAKER_12]: go and it's going to go forward and it's
going to make money and it's going to
[SPEAKER_12]: grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: And before you know it, you're going to be
10,000, 20,000, 80,000 orders and you're
[SPEAKER_12]: going to be, oh, I need that.
Make
[SPEAKER_12]: sure you don't get a bunch of,
you know, fuckery and thieves and people
[SPEAKER_12]: who are poisoning people.
[SPEAKER_12]: There has to be some government oversight
and some regulation.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what the right level is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not nuclear waste.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an herbal medication.
[SPEAKER_12]: It needs to be regulated as such.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you're talking about treatments
that go onto plants that are being mass
[SPEAKER_12]: produced, yeah, they're going to regulate
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: They should be.
[SPEAKER_12]: They always have, should be.
[SPEAKER_12]: But companies, large companies,
were afraid to do the research to
[SPEAKER_12]: basically bring that package forward and
say, okay, here's a fungicide that you can
[SPEAKER_12]: use on cannabis to control powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_12]: You could apply it at this rate,
at this time, and there's no degradation
[SPEAKER_12]: byproducts that are going to affect the
end product.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying that that product exists,
but in order for companies to develop that
[SPEAKER_12]: product, they need a regulatory pathway.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they've just spent millions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_12]: They need to recoup that investment.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, welcome to big business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mark, that's the thing that they're
motivated by, of course, by profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fear comes in when there's not
enough security to protect those
[SPEAKER_01]: investments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know they're going to be profitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you look at packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy a Cheerio.
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy a corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy a Tesla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you buy, it's all contextualized
within that understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what capitalism is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drive a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, I have to go do that
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think here, you just said it about
being able to use cannabis in TBIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have this job.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 years ago, I had a TBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a matter of fact, when I got it,
I was rolling a joint in the car that we
[SPEAKER_01]: got in a car accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So TBI or not, I had to go back into that
car and find that ounce or go to prison
[SPEAKER_01]: with a TBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a profoundly important point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody is going to be able to smoke
roll joints and smoke them so that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can do mitigate their seizure onset.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has to be a way to access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science is a tool, a profound tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fuck-up-ery, as you're saying,
is not the tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And neither is what inspires us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never the tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how we are changed and how we carry
that forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the cost is, whether that's what
we're willing to spend or what we demand
[SPEAKER_01]: of others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right now, I think we are in a very
tenuous position.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as Sam said, it's all perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's eventuality, not in the finite
sense, in the sense that in the quantum
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sort of have said, if it's all perfect
in the quantum sense, then I'm just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to step into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to step into that space because
it makes what I can't handle
[SPEAKER_01]: just say, yeah, I can't wait to see what
you do, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to share some of your coursework.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll just finish.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think HTN could probably provide a lot
of experience or at least maybe share some
[SPEAKER_12]: of those experiences.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're dealing with vendors,
I'm not talking about people who are
[SPEAKER_12]: touching the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm talking about everything else,
everything else that supports going at
[SPEAKER_12]: that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're talking about people who have
payrolls and employees.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those employees have benefits like
health insurance.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it was really quick to see when
you go to an MJBizCon, that if there's
[SPEAKER_12]: something that can be innovated,
that can be sold into this industry,
[SPEAKER_12]: it might be a corporation, but it might
just be a mom and pop corporation to
[SPEAKER_12]: people.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just garage inventors who are coming
up with the next little widget or all
[SPEAKER_12]: kinds of different innovations because
we're kind of at the birth of this new
[SPEAKER_12]: phase for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hate to use that word industry
because it always sounds like such a dirty
[SPEAKER_12]: word.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, for the lack of a better word,
it's just the word that we use.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the question is, I guess, again,
when you have, especially with CBD and the
[SPEAKER_12]: whole Delta A market, the whole loophole
that the farm bill created, which created
[SPEAKER_12]: this...
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it basically satisfied a market that
was already created.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, people want to get high,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And those people in most cannabis
unfriendly states in the country are gung
[SPEAKER_12]: ho on Delta A because people are making a
shit ton of money.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've seen videos where I've seen
pallet racks three high, like you'd see it
[SPEAKER_12]: like a Home Depot of finished goods going
from somewhere to somewhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those products are being sold without
any real process specification on this
[SPEAKER_12]: conversion of CBD to Delta A.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a lot of other stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And because it's unregulated, unlike the
stuff that ATN has to... I mean,
[SPEAKER_12]: everything that's sold in the regulated
market, Delta A says, well, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just going to do this in an
unregulated fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will become regulated.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's only made possible through the
prohibition of Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_12]: If there was no prohibition, then we would
think Delta A is the version of COVID or
[SPEAKER_12]: something.
[SPEAKER_12]: Delta A is irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Delta A is not extracted from the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's made as an active pharmaceutical
ingredient from CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is a market that exists because
people want to get high.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if people want to get high,
they need cannabis grown Delta 9,
[SPEAKER_12]: not Delta A made from CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just satisfying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really...
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the pandemic of a problem that's
created when there's a profit-driven
[SPEAKER_01]: creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're creating this because it's
driven by profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can make money when you can just
really get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to go through all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the issue we're facing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, can we work it out on Hash
Church?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's always worth the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why cannabis is legal,
however long it's taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: To some degree, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's motivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legality has been motivated in two
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, because people desire it,
know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It frees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps to heal the mind, body,
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential to make great deal of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, that we're sitting in
the middle of a kind of mosh pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that what can happen is that
these conversations, but really creating
[SPEAKER_01]: accountability, forcing accountability,
demanding accountability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't buy anything from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a principled piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe those things will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that industry that owns just about
everything, probably the house I live in
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty soon, or many people live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have to really work from this
space as individuals, speak to our
[SPEAKER_01]: community, support our community,
and ask of it the greatest possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always asking for something greater
because that's how we get it and we demand
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: From one another and from our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not going to get better if we buy
into it, only if we demand we join it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dropping out, we should have bought some
radio stations and television stations in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 60s.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to add that the profit-driven
corporations were birthed out of something
[SPEAKER_13]: different.
[SPEAKER_13]: The first time I really understood the
importance of regulation in cannabis was
[SPEAKER_13]: not from a corporation, but from my
friends in Jamaica who were just growing
[SPEAKER_13]: weed on the side of a mountain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I'm kind of like, I made bubble
one time with a flower and it was really
[SPEAKER_13]: fucked up bubble.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I walked around my friend's field
and what I found was some illegal
[SPEAKER_13]: fungicides that can't even be used in
North America that they just shipped to
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he used these and we had a
conversation later on that night on the
[SPEAKER_13]: beach.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I asked him, like, what were you
thinking?
[SPEAKER_13]: And he was like, I was thinking of putting
food on my table, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I can't afford to leave this crop.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it wasn't a big corporation putting
people at risk.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a poor Jamaican farmer who just
wanted to feed his family and who was,
[SPEAKER_13]: because there was no regulations,
he was able to do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the cost of everything,
I mean, John Perfello smoked some of that
[SPEAKER_13]: bubble and he said that he got extremely
sick from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was really bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep in mind when we're concentrating the
resins off of these plants often,
[SPEAKER_13]: you'll concentrate these chemical powders
that have been put onto the plant and are
[SPEAKER_13]: stuck on that resin.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not just corporations.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just, I got to pay my
shareholders.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes it goes all the way to the other
side.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's, I just got to put food on the
table.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not trying to buy a Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not trying to, you know, be some
corporate douche nozzle with a private
[SPEAKER_13]: jet.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really just trying to feed my kids and
maybe get them some shoes and some
[SPEAKER_13]: clothes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's the importance of
regulation.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to have a little bit of it to hold
each other accountable.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not always a corporation that you
have to hold accountable.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes it's just regular old people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who produced those additives, the
corporation?
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, it's cyclic and it goes back,
you know, it goes back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I hate to jump out of this
conversation with you all, but much much
[SPEAKER_01]: love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so thankful for being here and having
this opportunity to hang out with you all
[SPEAKER_01]: and much, much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an honor for us as well,
Valerie, to be safe on your journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got many big highs and much
expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fills my heart.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey Marcus, just, I wanted to add to what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's, hey buddy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragon fly fam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see you guys.
Etienne.
[SPEAKER_11]: Best friend farms.
[SPEAKER_11]: Always awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wade.
[SPEAKER_12]: You came up often in a conversation I had
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Adam's a G he's a, he's a good guy,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a, and if he's still listening,
we love you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Incredible grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what a good family they have up in
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mendocino grasslands for those that
don't know what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great family of individuals, really good
growers.
[SPEAKER_12]: But he calls Vermont home.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: He calls Vermont home.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's like us and East coaster.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but yeah, I mean, look, I think over
the years we've all, I think it was a lack
[SPEAKER_11]: of knowledge at first in North America.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were being, we were using things on
plants that we didn't know because we were
[SPEAKER_11]: so young at the time, at least my crew
was.
[SPEAKER_11]: Green Cure was pushed onto us as a product
to use to bring the pH level of the,
[SPEAKER_11]: of, you know, the, the surface level down.
[SPEAKER_11]: So patriotists and powdery mildew wouldn't
grow, but, you know, then later we learned
[SPEAKER_11]: that you can't light it on fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and we've, we've learned so much
through trial and error.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's the honest truth from,
from my side of it is like, we just didn't
[SPEAKER_11]: know.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we didn't have this big community
that's so open today.
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't have conferences.
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't have like private events and
sessions where we were sharing,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, like back to, you know,
like I had Marcus on truestoners.com chat
[SPEAKER_11]: room, you know, like, and I, we would chat
and like plural mongoose and caca and OT
[SPEAKER_11]: one and all these guys would jump in and,
and that was the only space that I really
[SPEAKER_11]: knew to ask live and direct questions that
would have direct risk call and response.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's, it's also a bit of it all
together.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we learn and evolve, you know,
having, you know, stages, stages such as
[SPEAKER_11]: Kelly and Josh around and others like you
that have been so deep in, in just
[SPEAKER_11]: learning about what agricultural practices
mean and consciousness means together and
[SPEAKER_11]: how that kind of plays a role.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that, that's something that,
you know, together we've, we've kind of,
[SPEAKER_11]: at least I should say personally,
I've really, you know, it's been a battle
[SPEAKER_11]: and a learning experience, this whole
journey, reading books from Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, they, they didn't tell you
what not to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: They told you what, what to do,
what, how to get rid of things and what to
[SPEAKER_11]: look for.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there was never that in-between
conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think those are the things that we
have today that just, we just didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: for so many years in print, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was, that was it, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I, I read those books front to back,
back to front every, almost every day for
[SPEAKER_11]: years, you know, and that was just the way
it was.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I didn't have anywhere else to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no YouTube channels and there
was no internet with no information or or
[SPEAKER_00]: basis of, but as, as you stated,
I mean, we started off as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: individual dispensaries and then we
realized, well, I realized that I got sick
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis off something I couldn't
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in 2007, why was like, well,
what are the standards for testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody, there's no standards for
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean there's no standards?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one testing except the
university of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I reached out to them to
actually say, Hey, can we get the
[SPEAKER_00]: standards?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, but, but, but we need the
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there were no standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I didn't know Sam at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I used Ethan Russo and
others to find Arno and then bring
[SPEAKER_00]: smuggled him into the States with his
testing solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, started to calibrate
an actual laboratory because I didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill people who have AIDS and cancer
for the possibility that they could get a
[SPEAKER_00]: upper respiratory infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I know now that that was an
actual plate test that would have
[SPEAKER_00]: determined that as opposed to
understanding the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started in that direction because that
sounded like a logical and found others
[SPEAKER_00]: Addison and Steve D'Angelo and others who
were also interested in doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we didn't have our semi-legal slash
illegal dispensaries, I mean, we spent BPG
[SPEAKER_00]: over a million dollars ourselves in that
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who could have, and in the private
industry would have spent that money to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do that testing to bring the,
at least the testing from THC and then
[SPEAKER_00]: finding CBD from the darkness into the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was us that took the chance
because we realized there was a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we didn't necessarily fix that
hole, there's always going to be a hole
[SPEAKER_00]: there that we're always going to trip
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, even as I'm a professional lay
scientist, realize that there was science
[SPEAKER_00]: that needed to be so that I didn't kill
the people that I was selling my quote
[SPEAKER_00]: unquote legal slash illegal cannabis to
because I wanted to be an ethical steward
[SPEAKER_00]: because it felt right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I self healed myself from cannabis
because of my Gulf war syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of my multiple chemical exposures,
because you know, I was gun fodder in a
[SPEAKER_00]: war over oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived under the oil fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was literally 28 degrees under the oil
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas out from under the oil fields,
it was 120 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how thick the smoke was,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that of course destroyed my nervous
system and my immunity system to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where I had to figure out how to heal
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by figuring out from cannabis and
exercise was able to stimulate my appetite
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat, motivated me to say, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to step outside myself and find a
way to help others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we have to be self-impacted
or find a way or someone in our lives has
[SPEAKER_00]: been impacted because I cannot tell you
how many people have come to me and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my family member has this,
that and the other and they can't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need to get it for them because
there's nowhere the way for us to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas two weeks ago, my group,
the Veterans Action Council was using
[SPEAKER_00]: science on Capitol Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 26 meetings in two days and we were
using that nasal spray that the medics are
[SPEAKER_00]: using currently in Israel as the litmus
because the majority of people we met with
[SPEAKER_00]: were on the veterans or armed services
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had military fellows there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found is the arrow through in
the conversation was this TBI nasal spray
[SPEAKER_00]: because it caused immediate shrinkage and
non-expansion that continues to happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right now Israeli medics have that
in their kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, if you're hit with a TBI,
no matter what, they are given this right
[SPEAKER_00]: there on the spot and it is having great
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk to these fellows who are
just military people in regular suits for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next year, this is what got through to
them because they understood how many of
[SPEAKER_00]: their brothers and sisters are also
suffering and will continue to suffer from
[SPEAKER_00]: these TBIs because of the new level of
warfare that we are experiencing or gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a way of using a
pharmaceutical product to loosen the
[SPEAKER_00]: strings of prohibition because that
mountain is still so high for us to move
[SPEAKER_00]: that we still have to find the human
aspect and the connection to make them
[SPEAKER_00]: realize, oh, this matters to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my fellow soldiers could benefit
from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that, oh, a lot of our
military has to be taken care of and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not being taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these TBIs follow everybody to their
graves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be best as we can to do as best as
possible to do as a preventative,
[SPEAKER_00]: which as we know, THC or ingestion of
cannabis right after a TBI seems to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stop the advancement of that psychosis
as well as the death, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: swelling of the brain itself, which causes
untold amounts of life damaging realities
[SPEAKER_00]: that not only does the soldier have to
deal with, but their family and their
[SPEAKER_00]: whole support units have to deal with,
as well as we ourselves have to pay for it
[SPEAKER_00]: as their care.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they have to be doing this on the
sideline at the NFL, as we've tragically
[SPEAKER_12]: seen recently, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: That these guys are out there getting
their brains literally beat in and then
[SPEAKER_12]: somehow they let that guy go back out and
he got re-injured, you know?
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the government knows it because they
got their own patent on the
[SPEAKER_12]: neuroprotective properties of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, this is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like you said, AT&T, the nasal spray is a
quick immediate onset into the brain.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, I think we're going to try to
stack.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, we're actually writing a grant to DOD
and NIH and others to basically help pay
[SPEAKER_12]: for this work because this is really,
really important work.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we all know it's going to
work.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to see the needle is going to
move on this.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't know exactly, you know,
again, dose and you have to look at a lot
[SPEAKER_12]: of different impacts when you're trying to
develop a new therapeutic process.
[SPEAKER_12]: Something like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, the blood brain barrier is a very
interesting kind of gateway that limits
[SPEAKER_12]: what's in your bloodstream going into your
brain.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, if you can get things across the
blood brain barrier, and what we know
[SPEAKER_12]: about cannabinoids, because they're very
hydrophobic, is that they can get in.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can get cannabinoids into the brain
during that golden hour of trauma.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, there's that, right, that one hour.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like you have an hour to basically
intervene.
[SPEAKER_12]: And even like with other brain disorders,
ATM, like stroke, right now with stroke,
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, just take two aspirin and call me
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's really no way of
treating, but you figure that,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, again, maybe it's the fact that
the government had a patent on it,
[SPEAKER_12]: maybe the fact that these things are off
patent now, and now in order for a
[SPEAKER_12]: pharmaceutical company to get the return
on that investment, they'd actually have
[SPEAKER_12]: to develop new medications to see if they
work.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think, again, the phyto
cannabinoids can give us a clue on what
[SPEAKER_12]: might eventually be the treatment that
gets FDA approval and all that kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, all that research needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it seems like, you know, again,
I don't know why, but when the NFL
[SPEAKER_12]: publicized that they were throwing a
billion dollars at research, they didn't
[SPEAKER_12]: look at concussion at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: They just looked at pain because all they
want to do is dull the pain and send that
[SPEAKER_12]: drone back out onto the field because
there's million-dollar sponsors that need
[SPEAKER_12]: to make money on that football game.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll tell you what, if you haven't
seen it yet, you all should watch the
[SPEAKER_12]: movie Concussion with Will Smith.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Will Smith and Dick and everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, get beyond that and go watch
that movie Concussion.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll never watch a football game.
[SPEAKER_12]: In the same way again, and you'll learn
that again, the NFL is basically
[SPEAKER_12]: conspiring to basically keep this thing
quiet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they want to keep it under wraps.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's the same treatment for soldiers.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be like full assault of cannabinoids
into the brain during that golden hour
[SPEAKER_12]: trauma.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe this could have saved Bob Saget's
life, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Bob Saget, the comedian,
they think he just fell in his bathtub or
[SPEAKER_12]: something, hit his head, fell asleep and
never woke up.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's definitely, the cannabinoids
are definitely on the therapeutic radar to
[SPEAKER_12]: use these things, not just to get high,
but to use them for their medical benefits
[SPEAKER_12]: to treat disease like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was speaking with Rob Clark and Rob
Clark said, Ms. Shulam said in the 80s
[SPEAKER_00]: that within that hour, if they smoked a
joint just on the way to the hospital,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of neuro protection that it's
untold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm very interested now because you
brought up strokes, because as we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you smoke cannabis, it dilates
or can dilate the blood, the blood
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're having a stroke and you've
got a blockage, could that also send the
[SPEAKER_00]: blockage to another area and causing more
danger?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I kind of wonder.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'm thinking, APN is just in sort of
like something where you're going to take
[SPEAKER_12]: advantage of the anti-inflammatory
pro-apoptotic modes.
[SPEAKER_12]: So cannabinoids are biologically active on
so many different levels.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you would think, again, that the best
thing you could possibly do is get as much
[SPEAKER_12]: into your brain at that point,
right after that traumatic brain injury,
[SPEAKER_12]: and just see what happens.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, could it be worse?
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are people working on this and
cannabinoids are definitely key,
[SPEAKER_13]: but one of the things you guys are
missing, the most important factor are
[SPEAKER_13]: these membrane bound extracellular
vesicles that are called exosomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exosomes have the ability to get through
the blood brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_13]: My friend who works at the neurosurgery
department in Florida, Miami, Dr. Brent
[SPEAKER_13]: Reynolds, he discovered brain stem cells
for his thesis in the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_13]: Brilliant guy, awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been doing some research at the
university on these exosomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when they put exosomes into the nasal
spray and up the nose, they found that it
[SPEAKER_13]: was delivering a 45 times payload from any
other method that they have at the
[SPEAKER_13]: university there, 45 times.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they are working on concussion
medications that'll be available in every,
[SPEAKER_13]: not just professional athletes,
but your children's sports games as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where you'll be able to use these exosomes
and exosomes are produced by pretty much,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, most cells, like not only
mammalian, but also a fungal and plant
[SPEAKER_13]: cells.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what Dr. Brent did was he isolated
exosomes from the hemp plant and lo and
[SPEAKER_13]: behold, those exosomes contained
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is really, really exciting
science.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope that this little blip gets you
lit, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you start going out and reading a
bunch of articles on this?
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause these exosomes, people have been
studying them for probably about 20 to 30
[SPEAKER_13]: years now, but it's getting exciting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Send me a link or something like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can send you a ton of papers.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have about a dozen papers that I can
send you on exosomes and you will be very
[SPEAKER_13]: excited because like I said, you can
extract them from the cannabis plants and
[SPEAKER_13]: they do contain cannabinoids in the
exosomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exosomes are used for cells communicate
with one another.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they sense, and Dr. Brent's even under,
you know, the belief system now that a lot
[SPEAKER_13]: of the amazing work that is being done
with stem cells are actually their
[SPEAKER_13]: exosomes that they're releasing to
communicate.
[SPEAKER_13]: So everyone, there's your homework for the
weak exosome, E-X-O-S-O-M-E.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're membrane bound extracellular
vesicles that are produced in the
[SPEAKER_13]: endosomal compartment of most eukaryotic
cells.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're nanoscopic.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're like 20 to 80 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they definitely break the blood brain
barrier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Along with medicinal mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's make sure the medicinal mushrooms
continue to be in the conversation when
[SPEAKER_07]: we're talking about blood brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_07]: They produce exosomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: They produce exosomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you, if you extract the exosomes
from medicinal mushrooms, you'll find the
[SPEAKER_13]: medicinal compounds.
[SPEAKER_13]: From those mushrooms in those exosomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_13]: The system is perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are bioavailable to our body
immediately.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, they help our body's
receptors and neural, and neurology become
[SPEAKER_07]: more regenerative.
[SPEAKER_07]: They regenerate.
[SPEAKER_07]: They, if, if every cell in our body has
380 trillion pathogens in it, basically
[SPEAKER_07]: every single cell, which how many cells?
[SPEAKER_07]: 180 million.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget how many cells are in the body,
but every 180 trillion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then every one of those cells has 380
trillion pathogens in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it really shows you that exosomes
and, and you, when you're, when your
[SPEAKER_07]: body's exuding, it's because it's out of
balance and, and it allows those pathogens
[SPEAKER_07]: out of the cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: It creates an environment where that part
of the cell can exude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's why this health and
wellbeing regimen, this, this nod to
[SPEAKER_07]: herbalism and mycology comes back in
because that group of people never got
[SPEAKER_07]: into chemicals and they continued to,
to, to walk that line of, of cellular
[SPEAKER_07]: regeneration and bioavailability to where
your body doesn't have to, it can accept
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why it's important.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's why it continues to show up at the
table.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's why it continues to be part of the
conversations because it's natural to us
[SPEAKER_07]: and it helps ourselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kelly's been doing amazing work with
athletes and trauma.
[SPEAKER_07]: And mountain biking and specifically
downhill mountain biking and with credible
[SPEAKER_07]: fractures, incredible breaks, concussions,
people hitting trees, rocks, and working
[SPEAKER_07]: with top athletes, which also have all
kinds of sponsors that need them to do,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, seven twenties and backflips and
trips and all the things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, they, they can't be out for
a whole summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would love, maybe Kelly will get
into it, but you know, to bring in
[SPEAKER_07]: professional athletes is also a type of
trauma.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different than soldiers course,
but it's trauma quick, trauma fast,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it can really affect you for the rest
of your, how many people have fallen and
[SPEAKER_07]: for the rest of their life, they talk
about this fall that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: made it to where they can't do all this
stuff, play soccer or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if you actually deal with the
trauma proper, you know, your body can
[SPEAKER_07]: rebalance when you find the compounds that
break the blood brain barrier,
[SPEAKER_07]: then it allows your body to function at
its organic chemistry, higher level,
[SPEAKER_07]: higher self.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with that, I really appreciate and
love you all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go outside and do some work,
some hand digging on the, in the earth and
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So big, big love to all you all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And every fractal of knowledge that comes
out of us, you know, is a positive one,
[SPEAKER_07]: a special big up to Wade laughter.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard enough from you today,
but just know every single day is a day
[SPEAKER_07]: that we are given.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for you and your journey and
everyone else in the world, everyone else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Blessed love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Josh had mentioned I've been,
I have been working with a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: with heavy duty brain trauma.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also am a brain trauma, you know,
I think an incredible success.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a story.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was seven years old, I had a car
accident that I lost my site for a long
[SPEAKER_06]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was cross-eyed for nine months.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and it, you know, was not only an
incredible concussion, but it broke my
[SPEAKER_06]: skull.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have an opening in my skull.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from that, I have suffered really
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, headaches, I don't really even,
you know, it's beyond migraines,
[SPEAKER_06]: some migraine that goes beyond.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when my brain has been looked at in
a CAT scan or in any other MRIs,
[SPEAKER_06]: I have showings of maybe a thousand
different strokes in my brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had the ability to either go totally
natural, which is why a lot of where I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: coming from, and I'm really tried and
true.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I work with several hundred patients
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I call them gems.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even want to call people patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I don't even feel like it's a
practitioner or it's a this or it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: that, or it's a seeker.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just being human on this planet right
now is traumatizing in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Being in a body is yet another
traumatizing thing in and of itself with
[SPEAKER_06]: all of the different toxins that it's
getting and all of the different wars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of different whatever spiritual means,
whatever you want to talk about,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're getting hit on all levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the reason why I'm going to continue to
be the voice for nature is because I
[SPEAKER_06]: understand that in a way that I don't need
to look towards other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that of course, science is a
representation of nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, science is a way for us to
explain nature, but it's the
[SPEAKER_06]: misrepresentation of where science has to
go to where then we have to correct it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because ATN, you're talking about so many
important things.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you're talking about is compassion
beyond.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet I hear so many different
dichotomies and fractions of science and
[SPEAKER_06]: war and industry has caused these ailments
for then people to have to go and seek
[SPEAKER_06]: nature to then go and seek more science
because people are utilizing what is
[SPEAKER_06]: registered and what is allocated by maybe
the EPA or science to then try to get it
[SPEAKER_06]: out of them to then go back to nature,
which is exactly what Val said.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cyclical and maybe cyclical starts
with an S-I-C-K because humans just tend
[SPEAKER_06]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think what we really can do is we
can come together and have this beautiful
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding that all of the beautiful
points of science that are truly trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: help us without monetary need,
without the lobbying, without all of the
[SPEAKER_06]: government control, because community
care, because what you're talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: with ATN, and I know definitely that's
where you're at with Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that there's people on the
planet who are utilizing these great
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledges for good and then people who
are utilizing these great knowledges just
[SPEAKER_06]: for money and profit to push forward a
possible ego or competition.
[SPEAKER_06]: But really what it comes down to is that
there are people who need to heal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is where we are going to reach
the highest collective consciousness of
[SPEAKER_06]: all of us, because we're all at that
highest level of healing that we all
[SPEAKER_06]: understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all following that highest level
of healing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we're going to actually go to
the next level.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're all seeking.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all seeking that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to say that,
first of all, I appreciate everything that
[SPEAKER_06]: you all are doing, every single one of
you, because, and I don't even mean just
[SPEAKER_06]: on this, anybody who's watching as well,
because you're wanting to be better,
[SPEAKER_06]: because you want to be a gem on this
planet who is making us all better.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know I got caught off on a tangent
there, but thank you all for listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: And mostly I'm just saying that I have a
deep, deep, deep appreciation for all of
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the tangent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm smoking good weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Love you, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm stoked to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Bubble Man, we haven't asked this in
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's everybody smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm smoking on some, some rosin
here myself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some tasty little squeeze
squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm smoking on my own rosin.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm smoking on my live hash rosin,
some Snow God, 84% cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_13]: 8.9% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm smoking on some beautiful bubble with
flower that just came off the hangers from
[SPEAKER_06]: this year, 2022.
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously it's a really nice uplifting
sativa with some really beautiful,
[SPEAKER_06]: heady space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to the breeder of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't remember who it was.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jen, I just wanted to say that when
did you start doing your lab testing?
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that in 2008 or soon after?
[SPEAKER_00]: We started in 2007 and I had to switch
labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2008 is when I really had a real lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you were doing it, you know,
a decade before, but the lab we were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: was in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were doing overtesting for Novartis
and Bayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had six HVA PLCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like four gas chromatographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew that I had sound scientists who
could at least, and then we brought Arno
[SPEAKER_00]: over to teach us the extraction because
back then it's $10,000 fine per test,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're caught with cannabis in a
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he taught us to do this suspended
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would take the a hundred percent
alcohol, shake the cannabis for grind it
[SPEAKER_00]: at an equal part than we would put it into
a tube and then shake it for one minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would extract that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that solution, then we would take
to the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's what we would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we would do 1500 tests on
between.
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand what you're saying is the
parts were so low of the active
[SPEAKER_10]: ingredient, but in the measured amount
that you could use it for calibration of
[SPEAKER_10]: your GCs and HPLCs.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it wasn't illegal to have this
standard.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also to remember that when they first
started testing in California and in the
[SPEAKER_10]: Netherlands also, more than 80%,
closer to 85% of all of the samples tested
[SPEAKER_10]: had either pesticides, insecticides,
and or microtransmitters.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, protection for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely was needed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey Sam, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you guys, when you and Rob were doing
your work at Warfarm, was there any sort
[SPEAKER_11]: of testing that was at your fingertips
when you guys were doing that work or was
[SPEAKER_11]: it hard to do that type of work?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a legally licensed lab.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had the HPLC, a prep so for isolating
small single amounts, gram amounts of a
[SPEAKER_10]: single cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had GCFID for doing terpenes and
cannabinoids also.
[SPEAKER_10]: I preferred a GC because when you smoke
cannabis or vape it, you're actually
[SPEAKER_10]: destroying part of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when a GC does its work, it destroys
part of the sample you put in.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's closer to what people are actually
consuming than HPLC will show the acid and
[SPEAKER_10]: the neutral elements, but it doesn't
really show what is being delivered to a
[SPEAKER_10]: person.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that a GC is exactly the same as a
person, but it's closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started with GCs and the problem was
the ignition was filling up the machinery
[SPEAKER_00]: so badly that that's why they gravitated
toward the UVHPLCs is because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance that was happening because of
the turnover at the gas chromatographs
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the ignition.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the HPLC is used so you can quantify
plant material and plant material is
[SPEAKER_12]: enriched with cannabinoid acids.
[SPEAKER_12]: What they often do is they just apply the
correction to correct for after
[SPEAKER_12]: decarboxylation what the cannabinoid acid,
which is measured this produces this
[SPEAKER_12]: amount of cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they should have like either what's
called a total THC or theoretical THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I mean, Sam, that's true that
what you smoke is what goes up to GC,
[SPEAKER_12]: but I think for to be more precise on what
is actually in the plant and especially if
[SPEAKER_12]: you're doing native like live resin
extractions or if you're making,
[SPEAKER_12]: again, really quality hash and turning it
into rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really having the cannabinoid acid profile
is going to give you a more complete
[SPEAKER_12]: understanding of what that oil actually
is.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree absolutely with you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_10]: About HPLCs, but I'm just saying that if
you want to know what happens,
[SPEAKER_10]: what the THC level is being delivered to
an average smoker in a joint, then a GC
[SPEAKER_10]: was actually more valuable to us for that
one aspect.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now there's an issue, and I don't know if
you're dealing with this at all,
[SPEAKER_12]: ATN, that there's this so-called thing
called lab shopping where producers are,
[SPEAKER_12]: again, going around to different labs and
trying to get the highest potency results
[SPEAKER_12]: that they can possibly get on large
batches reproducibly so they can have a
[SPEAKER_12]: more reliable route to market without it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uncumbering people trying to negotiate to
lower prices because again, this is also
[SPEAKER_12]: just the pain of prohibition, I think,
is that there is a downward pressure on
[SPEAKER_12]: producers to basically, I mean,
again, the margin especially if you look
[SPEAKER_12]: at a mature state like California is the
margins that you're seeing at the
[SPEAKER_12]: dispensary and distributor levels are
certainly not equalized across the whole
[SPEAKER_12]: production supply chain.
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly, I think if you look at states
that are rolling out new programs where
[SPEAKER_12]: you have vertically integrated
organizations where underneath one license
[SPEAKER_12]: or a group of licenses, you have
cultivation, extraction, manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_12]: and dispensing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know California inserts distribution,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So those distributors can make a lot of
money, but really, so my son who's out in
[SPEAKER_12]: LA right now and doing really well,
I mean, just to break into that market is
[SPEAKER_12]: really difficult because you really need
to have some kind of stratification
[SPEAKER_12]: through that distribution dispensing
market to get enough volume to make your
[SPEAKER_12]: teeny weeny margin enough to pay the
bills, right, Colin?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're hitting it on the head,
man, but yeah, but I also find it at what
[SPEAKER_11]: Marcus said earlier with spraying and IPM
management, it's also on the farmer's end.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're looking for higher COAs too,
so they can sell it into the market
[SPEAKER_11]: because that helps them, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there's this weird smoke and
mirrors that tack means something,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And quality is not quantitated and
qualitative through any of these numbers.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a glimpse of what's there in terms
of weight and chemical classes,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: The current issue right now that's led to
this so-called phenomenon or called lab
[SPEAKER_12]: shopping is that when you get bud at the
dispensary, it's not dry, there's still
[SPEAKER_12]: moisture in it, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So certainly like if you're looking at a
COA and you're reporting potencies based
[SPEAKER_12]: on a dried weight basis, dried weight
means bone dry, that means it's no water.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to really have good technique
to do the water activity measurement to
[SPEAKER_12]: understand what fraction of that cannabis
has received at the dispensary because
[SPEAKER_12]: it's not bone dry, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: It has moisture.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has like 12.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but Mark, here's where I'd argue
through my journeys and even the last
[SPEAKER_11]: month where I had an issue, not even an
issue, this is just how it went,
[SPEAKER_11]: where I sent a batch in, it had 11% or 9%
moisture, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I sent it in, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the R&D COA.
[SPEAKER_11]: They tested it and they said that it had
12% moisture and the tack was actually
[SPEAKER_11]: higher than lower moisture.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the same lab, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So same lab, same, same, same,
same.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even within a lab, it's statistically
problematic to make comparisons because
[SPEAKER_12]: there's so much fucking variation here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what this really relies on is the
fact that, so when you, so, okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: How to describe this quickly.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to do the water activity
measurement, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: The water, so actually there was a woman
who gave a really good talk on this at the
[SPEAKER_12]: online cannabis symposium that I think is
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think she's also giving the American
Chemical Society's journal club
[SPEAKER_12]: presentation this month.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if you Google it, her name is
Ginny, I think, and she gave a great talk
[SPEAKER_12]: on it and describes exactly what this
phenomena is.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what you need to do is when you're
assessing potency and you're reporting it
[SPEAKER_12]: on as it's different than dried weight,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And Colin, this is really important.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, goes to what Sam was saying is
that when they're determining the moisture
[SPEAKER_12]: content in a moisture balance,
which is just a little mini oven that you
[SPEAKER_12]: put a sample on, it just weighs before and
after.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just, you heat it up, the water
goes away.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what else happens?
[SPEAKER_12]: Turbanes go away, cannabinoids
decarboxylate.
[SPEAKER_12]: So now you've totally changed everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: You no longer have the same denominator
that you had when you started with that
[SPEAKER_12]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we used to use a glass
desiccator.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do leave it in it overnight with
those blue crystals that turn.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: That would get rid of an indicator in
there that tells you that that would get
[SPEAKER_10]: rid of 99% of the moisture, not 100%,
but as close as we could get in our lab in
[SPEAKER_10]: an easy way.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we always did before we tested
anything with our GC.
[SPEAKER_12]: But Sam, the key thing is you're not
heating it up, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we're not heating it up at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you're in a cannabis testing lab
and you have hundreds of samples,
[SPEAKER_12]: do you think you can wait for desiccator?
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, what this woman showed is that
you could just do a room temperature
[SPEAKER_12]: vacuum desiccation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And even at that room temperature vacuum
desiccation, you're still losing a big
[SPEAKER_12]: chunk of the terpenes, but you're not
doing the cannabinoid decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it turns out again, when you're
testing something and you're in the 20%
[SPEAKER_12]: regime of cannabinoids, total
cannabinoids, that amount of CO2 is
[SPEAKER_12]: significant.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you decarboxylate it, and again,
this is going back to the original
[SPEAKER_12]: discussion about using gas chromatography,
which is when you decarboxylate it,
[SPEAKER_12]: you've chemically altered the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no other way of saying it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know what you're saying, Sam,
that while you're smoking it when you're
[SPEAKER_12]: decarboxylating it, but if someone's using
it as like a tincture or if I know some
[SPEAKER_12]: people who are now putting live rosin into
gummies and they taste delicious,
[SPEAKER_12]: they taste like the rosin from which they
were derived, man, they taste really good.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there, I don't think there's any
decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think there's, I think it's just
raw rosin going into the gummy itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they're decarbs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they are decarbs?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you decarb the patties and then you
can drop that and do whatever you need to,
[SPEAKER_11]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you agree with me,
Colin.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's certainly, I think I like
seeing the HPLC data because the HPLC data
[SPEAKER_12]: showed me what that flower contains.
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly the GC data is cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what you need for like a
headspace measurement for turkeys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think anytime you have more data to
compare against itself and pit against
[SPEAKER_11]: itself, as you know, the 10% variance in
each state is also a problematic aspect
[SPEAKER_11]: that gets tacked on to all these things
like Colorado, for instance, is a really,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's just kind of confusing to be honest,
in terms of how they calculate milligram
[SPEAKER_11]: serving.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, cause there's a denominator that they
have to do math on to get that actual,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, milligram serving that they
believe is in your product.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you test for say 85%, there's a 10%
variance that gets tacked onto that,
[SPEAKER_11]: that knocks it down to 70%.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, maybe below 70, maybe 68,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a reason why we had HPLC and the
GC and an HCLP prep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause that allowed us to isolate several
grams of a single cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was really important to have all
three of those.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what we used the most actually was
GCFID, especially for turkeys.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's, that was our,
our go-to tool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just put in a.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big ethical problem that we found when
we started to do testing was exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole problem that we're talking is
because we realize also the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: those original 1500 tests that the
majority of them were very chemically
[SPEAKER_00]: close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we realized is that there was
going to be a perception that THC
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage was somehow going to matter to
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew that that was not the real
case here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, Harborside decided to
flood it out as we were deciding the
[SPEAKER_00]: ethical realities, because it is still
prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people think along the lines of alcohol
that, oh, it's just because it's a high
[SPEAKER_00]: number, I must be getting more fucked up
and must be getting more of the sensation
[SPEAKER_00]: and more of that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas we know it's a symbiotic relation,
that ensemble effect of the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: diterpenes, sesquiterpenes and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: ingested together that are giving us that
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the thing that's also
missing for these that nasal spray is of
[SPEAKER_00]: course, it's THC dominant, but it needs
all the other spectrum.
[SPEAKER_10]: The easiest way to understand that is
smoke 100% pure THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: It does not get you high as pure cleaned
up resin of skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only 50, 60, 70% of THC at the most.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the resin gets you higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_10]: By weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't understand in 07,
08, the terpenes and all of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we were still quantifying the THC
and then finding that secondary spike,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also the understanding we've
been able to gain as we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: strike this off the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it opened up these other
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: To where now we're testing CBG,
CBGA and all the other acid precursors and
[SPEAKER_00]: our understanding and finding our new
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now science can play and we've
checked off that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have to continue to add to that
list, but also add to our understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: why it matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because science is still not replicating
what the plant is producing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We still, nobody's been able to take a
terpene recipe and make it exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's because they're not using the other
volatile organic compounds that are
[SPEAKER_13]: present in the profile.
[SPEAKER_13]: They just are thinking about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are other volatiles, but besides
that, they're not using all of the 150
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes, which are found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: They might be using 10 of them or 20 of
them, but the average terpene,
[SPEAKER_10]: we were able to find about 50 or more
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we only had maybe 100 or 120 of the
terpenes to do our testing with.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was terpenes that we didn't have,
which even if they're there in tiny,
[SPEAKER_10]: tiny amounts, I mean, terpenes are there
in tiny amounts to start with.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yet they really have an incredible
effect.
[SPEAKER_10]: The right terpenes can definitely make
cannabis more potent and modulate the
[SPEAKER_10]: effects in a major way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the issue is that when you're
talking about a commodity, any commodity,
[SPEAKER_12]: any commodity where large scale
manufacturing, third party testing and
[SPEAKER_12]: production is happening, there be some
ways, some metrics of basically testing
[SPEAKER_12]: for quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, Etienne, I kind of hear what
you're saying about THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think of also the psychology of the
dispensary buyer.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when they go to buy a product,
okay, they can look at the product,
[SPEAKER_12]: they could smell it, but what's its THC
percentage or THCA percentage if they know
[SPEAKER_12]: what they're talking about, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's just, again, a metric.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it's not the right metric,
but it is a metric.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you're talking about,
say, buying large quantities of plant
[SPEAKER_12]: material and you have, I don't know,
50 kilos at 14%, but you have 50 kilos,
[SPEAKER_12]: 18%, which one are you gonna, I think that
there's a business mentality there,
[SPEAKER_12]: but also if you're in our business where
you're extracting, well, now the THC
[SPEAKER_12]: percentage makes sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I've seen now?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've seen this on a couple of
different COAs where the plant makes
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoid acids, but obviously the
dispensary or the COA is gonna report that
[SPEAKER_12]: total THC number.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I think what people do to up their
THC numbers is they spray distillate.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of like spraying and dipping
and all that kind of shit going on.
[SPEAKER_12]: These days, shit, they're putting what,
HHC distillate now onto hemp.
[SPEAKER_12]: And selling HHC flower, which totally
doesn't exist, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So now that there's that infrastructure
that, okay, we can just take a distillate.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can just do that on the samples we send
off for testing.
[SPEAKER_12]: The thing about that is that here's where
HPLC makes a difference because if you're
[SPEAKER_12]: testing flower, you're gonna see those
cannabinoids as cannabinoid acids.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they're spraying with THC distillate,
that's been decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'll see a THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: That will come out and they'll be like,
well, total THC is 25% because we add the
[SPEAKER_12]: THC that's existing with the THCA.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now granted, there is some adventitious
decarboxylation that just happens after
[SPEAKER_12]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you guys know as well as I know that
we all like fresh material.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think part of that freshness is
exactly what you're saying, Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's that whole underlying symphony of
terpenes and even, they're not necessarily
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenes but they're terpenoids I call
them because like those prenatal sulfides,
[SPEAKER_12]: which that group out in Oregon has now
basically used a volatile sulfur detector
[SPEAKER_12]: to detect are the skunky essence of
cannabis, prenal sulfides and the
[SPEAKER_12]: disulfide of prenal sulfide.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they now have actually a mass that
they're using at testing labs to assign
[SPEAKER_12]: the gassiness of a strain based on the
detection of these volatile sulfides.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Marcus, we have that dude on church,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Before they published their paper,
that guy came on Hash Church because I
[SPEAKER_12]: remember that was the first time we had
that conversation, I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: What was his name?
[SPEAKER_10]: He was talking about trials.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_12]: That guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the professor- He's coming back for
sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a professor there and he's
involved in the American Chemical Society
[SPEAKER_12]: subdivision.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've met him at a couple of meetings
since we had that discussion on church.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they basically have a gas scale of
gassiness and how gassy your weed or your
[SPEAKER_12]: hash is based on the detection of these
volatile sulfides.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, that's just, that's a recent
discovery just with like in the last two
[SPEAKER_12]: years, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Max and his team at Abstract, they're the
ones who kind of discovered it,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, keep in mind, Nick discovered it
about 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when that paper came out, he did
chuckle to himself a few times.
[SPEAKER_13]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I remember, he did it in hops.
[SPEAKER_13]: He did it in hops.
[SPEAKER_13]: He discovered four 1400 different files in
hops with that very machine that Mark is
[SPEAKER_13]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like some ridiculously like one
to the trillion or something like it was-
[SPEAKER_13]: He came on and he explained it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they found five or so in cannabis
so far.
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of them is suspected of being much
stronger smelling than all the rest.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got several of the files here,
but nobody has- Of course you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I asked if they can do the terp profile of
dog shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I want to do is I want to know if the
files contribute to potency or modulation.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure they do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't you think, Sam?
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't assume that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of the terpenes don't.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, but I'm sure what they do is they,
I'm sure they modulate in that they help
[SPEAKER_12]: create, and I've said this before,
in church before, and I think there is
[SPEAKER_12]: references out in the literature,
just increases the fluidity at the
[SPEAKER_12]: membrane, at the cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_12]: So terpenes help exchange stuff across the
cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think what happens in that,
Sam, and it might be advantageous,
[SPEAKER_12]: is that there are things that now come
into the cell that up-regulate cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_12]: receptor expression.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think part of the entourage effect
is that up-regulation of the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_12]: receptors that has to happen, that happens
with full spectrum extracts, that just
[SPEAKER_11]: doesn't happen with the single- I think
beta-karyophylline kind of diminishes your
[SPEAKER_11]: THCA effects, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we basically did was took 25
milligrams of absolutely 100% pure THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: We weighed these, put them in a volcano
with the tiny spike of a single terpene,
[SPEAKER_10]: and we went through about 15 of the
different terpenes, the top ones,
[SPEAKER_10]: and some of them definitely potentiated.
[SPEAKER_10]: More of them modulated, but all of them
did not do things, and like you say,
[SPEAKER_10]: karyophylline, I felt was negative.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's a few that do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's interesting, might be actually one
of them as well, I find.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, karyophylline's going to be a CB2
agonist, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So it acts as basically a cannabinoid,
and there's been this discussion about
[SPEAKER_12]: calling it a cannabinoid because the
people who found that out called it a
[SPEAKER_12]: dietary cannabinoid, you know?
[SPEAKER_12]: Beta-karyophylline because it's in,
you know, a black pepper.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean like I think there's all
kinds of new recent data on cannabis that
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of like fleshes out some of the
entourage effect because they're finding
[SPEAKER_12]: not only more compounds in cannabis
extract that contribute to the overall
[SPEAKER_12]: biological effect, but they're discovering
new receptors that these things are
[SPEAKER_12]: hitting.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're learning more and more and
more.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I say they, we, I mean collectively,
us scientists and everyone, the whole
[SPEAKER_12]: human race, I mean, we do have a crystal
ball.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called the scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, science is the fascinating
subject for kids to learn and to be
[SPEAKER_12]: fascinated in.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just, there's all kinds of fascinating.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you have a microscope and you have a
kid, you have a whole day of activity,
[SPEAKER_12]: man.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just want to go back and say one
other thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is, again, talking about some of
the things that these...
[SPEAKER_13]: Your mic is hot, Nick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_13]: Your mic is hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not muted.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just letting you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could hear some sound coming through.
[SPEAKER_13]: And welcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about smiles.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought I'd invite you in because
you're one of the guys that opened that,
[SPEAKER_13]: you were the guy that opened that
conversation up with me.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, yeah, Dr. Mark, if you want to
catch them up.
[SPEAKER_13]: The question really is do they modulate?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ask that question.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the discovery of the sulfur compounds
that you guys have found and now I met
[SPEAKER_12]: with Ian in that group at the APS meeting.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were looking at the so-called gas
factor and assigning gas factor based on
[SPEAKER_12]: the quantification of these volatile
sulfides.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, there was just the question
on... Because I think Sam and other people
[SPEAKER_12]: are, again, discussing about different
compounds that modulate the effects of
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it known whether or not... Nick is the
co-party who sent me my terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who did you get them from?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Who said what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Nick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which party did you get them from?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the name of the lab?
[SPEAKER_10]: Abroxus?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm afraid I can't remember the name of
the lab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Abstract?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's correct.
Abstract.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually, I have not been working with
them, but I've communicated with them on
[SPEAKER_09]: some of their research and some of what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think some of their claims are a little
bit broad, but they're definitely doing as
[SPEAKER_09]: well as you can work.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people in this space are.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were the only people I was able to
obtain the pure thiol scrum and I need to
[SPEAKER_10]: do the work, but I have a little bit of
trouble getting pure THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Until I get the pure THC, I can't do the
thiol work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are you based?
[SPEAKER_10]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see what I can do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will see if I can find you some fun
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got my email on here, so go ahead
and send me your address.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of the terpenes are legal here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the cannabinoids are legal in
Holland, except for Delta-9 and Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the rest of them are.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe even Delta-8 might be legal,
I forget, but Delta-9 is not legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Delta-9 THCA, is that legal?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is what legal?
[SPEAKER_10]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_10]: THCA, no, that's not legal because what
you have to do is heat it up and it turns
[SPEAKER_10]: into THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, that's not legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: In any case, I'll see if I can find some
fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of standards, I just wanted to
mention, too, when we were talking about
[SPEAKER_10]: standards in labs before, that one of the
big problems when we first started,
[SPEAKER_10]: because we started our lab more than two
decades ago, was the problem that when you
[SPEAKER_10]: would order analytical standards from
SAGMA or from the United Nations of Drug
[SPEAKER_10]: People, that when we would test them on
our HPLC, we would find they weren't as
[SPEAKER_10]: stated.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you calibrate your machines according
to what they say they are without checking
[SPEAKER_10]: yourself, then what you find out is that
all of your results are skewed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that we found as well is
that a lot of these... Sorry, guys,
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot of crosstalk here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm in the delta lounge.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of the standards are actually,
especially for thiolates and thiolates,
[SPEAKER_09]: because they're kind of tricky to analyze.
[SPEAKER_09]: We found that needing a sulfuric
hemoluminescence detector array is really
[SPEAKER_09]: one of the things that drives up your
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the other issue is that there hasn't
been a tremendous amount of research done
[SPEAKER_09]: into them, and so the bands are not as
narrow for what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're clustering a lot of things
together.
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually see things like 4MMP is
listed as being this one very important
[SPEAKER_09]: thiol in aeromatics.
[SPEAKER_09]: In reality, the standard we use is
actually covering several isomers as well
[SPEAKER_09]: as some other compounds that are right
next to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of purity, that's the indicator
thiol, or that's the indicator that they
[SPEAKER_09]: use the thiols and thiolates that are in
that region, but it's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_09]: specific to that one thiol.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alternatively, the other issue is that
it's hard to disassociate them from each
[SPEAKER_09]: other without some extremely
high-performance chromatography systems,
[SPEAKER_09]: and we were still working on that before I
left Yakima Chief.
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting the accuracy down was challenging
at best.
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, it was that way with the
cannabinoids when we started in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_10]: When we built our first lab, there was no
way to separate really without really,
[SPEAKER_10]: really specialized columns, which were
rare and expensive, CBC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody was co-elucidating all of those
together and reporting them as one peak
[SPEAKER_10]: instead of, in fact, they were two peaks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the other tricky aspect is,
especially if you're using GCMS,
[SPEAKER_09]: the sulfur compounds, most of the
detectors don't like them, so you need to
[SPEAKER_09]: have a separate detector for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even then, it's really just a method
development that has to continue because
[SPEAKER_09]: there aren't a lot of established methods.
[SPEAKER_09]: Agilent has been working with us on
improving public access to those methods,
[SPEAKER_09]: so it's a good thing, but we're still a
couple years out and getting it really,
[SPEAKER_09]: really nailed down.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the reason why we never looked at
thiols, because we had no way to determine
[SPEAKER_10]: the thiol percentages or anything else in
our lab.
[SPEAKER_10]: We wished we could, but there was no way,
so we didn't try.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only that, the best detectors are
actually really good at detecting and good
[SPEAKER_09]: at isolating, but they're not very good at
quantitation, so it's a challenge all the
[SPEAKER_09]: way around.
[SPEAKER_09]: David, you said something earlier about
what's known about the co-effects and the
[SPEAKER_09]: impact and whether or not they potentiate
or they interfere with.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, that research hasn't yet been
done.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just speaking to Ethan Russo last
week about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's very interested in it as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to try to see if we can set some
studies up with everybody, but to me,
[SPEAKER_09]: evolutionarily, is it makes sense that
there would be some neurological impact
[SPEAKER_09]: because they're so important in human
evolution and mammalian evolution in
[SPEAKER_09]: general, looking at the ways that they
predict ripening and they predict
[SPEAKER_09]: fermentation and they also predict
cutressin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are three very important survival
tools for mammals.
[SPEAKER_09]: The one thing that's really interesting I
found is that durian is a very succinct
[SPEAKER_09]: fruit in the world, they call it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's extremely high in 3MH and 4MNP as
well as some other thioates and pentane
[SPEAKER_09]: thioates that are more the gassy,
garlic, easily nastiness in very,
[SPEAKER_09]: very high quantities.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when they're high proportions.
[SPEAKER_09]: The tigers were obligate carnivores.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll make their way to a durian tree and
defend it because they like the durian so
[SPEAKER_09]: much.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got a lot of protein, it's got a lot
of fat in it as well, but the fact that
[SPEAKER_09]: they're able to detect those thioates and
they use it as a source of food for an
[SPEAKER_09]: obligate carnivore is pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very curious.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also used to be curious in flavonoids
because I know that they can modulate and
[SPEAKER_10]: potentiate things, but orally they can,
but if you smoke them, it deactivates
[SPEAKER_10]: them.
[SPEAKER_10]: The flavonoids are not responsible for the
smoked different effects in canvas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Orally, that could be a completely
different story.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an awful lot of terpenes that
really have no effects.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't get too high.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, I'm not talking medical here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking recreational.
[SPEAKER_10]: The same thing with the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the cannabinoids do not get too
high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but they do have an impact on the
sort of CB1, CB2, as well as the other
[SPEAKER_09]: receptors, and they have an impact on
modulating, say, for example, your gut
[SPEAKER_09]: health.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them certainly do.
[SPEAKER_10]: A prime example is the way CBD will delay
the onset, reduce the peak experience,
[SPEAKER_10]: and make the whole thing last longer for
THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as an example, so not just not just
CBD, but like looking at, say,
[SPEAKER_09]: piperine and veticaria, finally,
is the impact that that has.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the old adage, if somebody's
having a bad trip or having an adverse
[SPEAKER_09]: reaction to THC and they're kind of having
an anxiety issue, give them a teaspoon or
[SPEAKER_09]: tablespoon of black pepper to munch on,
and it pretty much nerfs it very,
[SPEAKER_09]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the mechanism is not understood,
but it seems to be the case of anecdotal
[SPEAKER_09]: experiences driving research, and it's
really exciting to see that sort of stuff
[SPEAKER_09]: start to happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for years I've been trying to get
too high on THC products, but so far I've
[SPEAKER_10]: been pretty unsuccessful.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and just for conversation,
I would love to bring in, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: people out there who, the more that the
plant is concentrated, the less high that
[SPEAKER_06]: they get.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've talked with Ethan Russo at length
about this, and at first it was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: no, that's not possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people who don't get high
off of a dab at all, and maybe a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit of hash, they really don't feel the
effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the more natural that it is,
or the more flower or joint or maybe out
[SPEAKER_06]: of a bong that it is, they would be
getting a higher effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what was brought up conversation after
a couple of years at length,
[SPEAKER_06]: brings the entourage effect back into the
conversation without having to elude it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The amino acids are destroyed during
vaporization or smoking.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in terms of edibles, you can certainly
get some of those, but in general,
[SPEAKER_09]: they are destroyed by smoking.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, like the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, and the polyphenols.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there seems to be something that's
happening when, you know, the more raw,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's even combusting, whether it's
an edible, you know, people that are
[SPEAKER_06]: getting more effects off of an edible,
even if it is in butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hear, and I understand that the
amino acids are alive there, but there's
[SPEAKER_06]: something that's happening for a lot of
people that need the more raw compounds,
[SPEAKER_06]: even if it's decarboxylated, even if it's
heated up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a conversation that we don't
understand yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd love to hear what you all think
about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Could it be as simple as when you take
cannabinoids, THC especially, orally,
[SPEAKER_10]: then you don't get high on the THC,
you get high on the 11-hydroxy after it
[SPEAKER_10]: goes through the liver.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what reaches the brain and the blood
is not THC, it's primarily 11-hydroxy,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is a bit stronger in effects than
THC and a bit different.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it could be as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be the same with
decarboxylation or, you know, heating up
[SPEAKER_06]: at any temperature?
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be the same?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: The liver actually converts the delta-9
into 11-hydroxy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And with sort of going into that,
that's sort of an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anecdotally, some people don't have the
enzymes, the liver enzymes or
[SPEAKER_09]: functionality to process some of the THC
into the bioactive form from oral
[SPEAKER_09]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it depends on the form that it comes
in.
[SPEAKER_09]: As an example, I've consumed upwards of
300 milligrams of delta-8 orally and had
[SPEAKER_09]: zero effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas, you know, a vape instantly
affects me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is definitely very much lighter than
delta-9.
[SPEAKER_09]: But orally, I just, for some reason,
my body doesn't process the material.
[SPEAKER_09]: My cousin, he has the same thing with
delta-9.
[SPEAKER_09]: He can consume just insane quantities of
delta-9 edibles and he gets no effect at
[SPEAKER_09]: all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, this needs to be studied
more, but I suspect that there's probably
[SPEAKER_09]: some gene deletes or some enzyme deletes
in different people to explain that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what you're talking about is the
overall like- It is that way for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_09]: American Indians don't have the gene.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: All drugs can trace migration by that.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a really interesting, but the
point you bring about the whole sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: full spectrum material is, I think,
salient.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the total quantity of all the
material in working together will give you
[SPEAKER_09]: a different effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so as an example, I'll go back to the
pure THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like pure THC beverages do almost nothing
to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: They do get me like sort of instantly
intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's a very thin, very narrow
experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get the relaxation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get the enjoyment of it as much.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not just from the aroma and
flavor of it, but it's the combination of
[SPEAKER_09]: everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I 100% agree that the full spectrum
material is a quantitatively, or is a
[SPEAKER_09]: quantifiably different experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's certainly a qualitatively
different experience than isolates.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's similar for anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: A good cup of coffee is significantly more
enjoyable and is going to give you a
[SPEAKER_09]: different impact, whether it be
psychosocial or not, sorry, psychological
[SPEAKER_09]: or not, than just, you know, a fingertip
of caffeine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is different.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the complexities of those
interactions are very, very difficult to
[SPEAKER_09]: disentangle and study.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the typical approach of doing,
you know, one compound plus one modulator
[SPEAKER_09]: is where we need to start doing this
research, but we really need to start
[SPEAKER_09]: looking at significantly more complicated,
you know, probably all significantly more
[SPEAKER_09]: complicated arrangements of all of these
compounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And instead of doing sort of additions,
doing deletes from a sort of full spectrum
[SPEAKER_09]: mix.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you say, okay, we've got a full
spectrum that's completely quantified.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know what everything that's in it now
let's remove one of those fractions at a
[SPEAKER_09]: time and see what the result is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be, it's going to take,
you know, probably decades to complete
[SPEAKER_09]: that research because of all of the
possible combinations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And some would say, rightly, that it's
probably not worth doing because of the
[SPEAKER_09]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's worth doing, Nick.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got to find out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause it's, it's maybe a million different
combinations you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say trillions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every person is different and every person
is different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go subjective.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Nick and Sam still getting to that
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think I would just love maybe even
to marinate on it and get back to me or
[SPEAKER_06]: what you all think, but just that idea
that people who can feel effects off of
[SPEAKER_06]: say a joint or any, any other raw form,
but as soon as it's concentrated or the
[SPEAKER_06]: more that it's concentrated, even whether
it's rosin, even whether it's from a full
[SPEAKER_06]: spectrum plant, it's just the actual idea
of concentrating those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's being left out that the person no
longer has effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think that's the key point.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not about the level of concentration.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about the exclusion of other
components.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's I think that's a very,
very important distinction to make is that
[SPEAKER_09]: it's not necessarily the concentration is
the problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that the elimination of any of the
compounds will provide an intended
[SPEAKER_09]: experience is, is what's going to be
driving that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And excuse me, Nick.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't mean to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, what I was going to say was that what
we found was that the other materials in
[SPEAKER_10]: the plant did not contribute to you
getting higher, but the resin heads,
[SPEAKER_10]: they did.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you just cleaned up the resin heads
and made them so that they were like 99%
[SPEAKER_10]: of resin heads with nothing else,
I found that got me higher than anything
[SPEAKER_10]: else.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and again, intolerance is an issue
here and it's subjective, but I think that
[SPEAKER_09]: in general, from all of the research that
I've done and all of the work that I've
[SPEAKER_09]: been doing and obviously the work that
Marcus has been doing with hash and bubble
[SPEAKER_09]: hash and cleaning those up, we see that
the vast majority of effects do come from
[SPEAKER_09]: those resin heads.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not to say that there isn't other,
that there aren't other compounds in the
[SPEAKER_09]: other material that won't change that
experience, but that the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_09]: the sort of recreational interests is
concentrated anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: And medical is concentrated in,
in the resin heads, except when it comes
[SPEAKER_09]: to things like you mentioned that the
amino acids and the proteins, as well as
[SPEAKER_09]: the, the polyphenol groups and the
flavonoids, which are, which are a huge
[SPEAKER_09]: group and they're starting to be studied,
but it's complex to study them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those will, you're only going to get an
effect from in edible form through oral
[SPEAKER_09]: consumption just because of the nature.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think flavonoids are very important
for a lot of people, but I was really,
[SPEAKER_10]: really focused on just the recreational
focus.
[SPEAKER_10]: And once I found out that when you smoke
flavonoids, it deactivated them,
[SPEAKER_10]: then I did not focus on them anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be the end of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: They thermally degrade.
[SPEAKER_12]: They thermally degrade.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't volatilize.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the problem with the spice
cannabinoids too, the synthetic
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoids is that they, they don't
seemingly vaporize, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: They thermally degrade.
[SPEAKER_13]: Earlier when you said the exclusion of
components, is it always the exclusion of
[SPEAKER_13]: components or are, or are there different
genetic makeups that have blind spots in
[SPEAKER_13]: some form or another where they can't
experience these?
[SPEAKER_09]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're, they're every year in both the
plant and the person.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're, there are like human beings
have, have anosmias and there are certain
[SPEAKER_09]: people that simply like have a very low
sort of aroma sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that actually, they would be almost be
a perfect candidate for study of effects
[SPEAKER_09]: because that would eliminate their
subjective enjoyment aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like by, by, by choosing people that can't
detect aromas, we would actually be able
[SPEAKER_09]: to see.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like doing it both ways, Nick,
where you, you eliminate one thing at a
[SPEAKER_10]: time and then eliminate two things at a
time and then three.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you, you also do it the way we did it,
which was we had 25 milligrams of THC and
[SPEAKER_10]: we spiked it with a single terpene,
then another single terpene, then another
[SPEAKER_10]: single terpene and smoked them on
different days so that we could evaluate
[SPEAKER_10]: what they did.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were primarily looking for ones that
potentiated and if they modulated one to
[SPEAKER_09]: know how Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I would love to talk about more
about this and there's some groups that
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to possibly bring into this
conversation at some point, because it's
[SPEAKER_09]: a, it's really, I think it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the implications are huge for the
recreational market as well as for,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, therapy as medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that, you know, it's,
it's, it's one of those things where we
[SPEAKER_09]: need to move away from the dogma of single
compound, single effect into, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: the compounding effects of multi-finally
well-managed ADHD.
[SPEAKER_09]: And cannabis is certainly a part of that,
is that the combination of multiple salts
[SPEAKER_09]: of amphetamine salts is more effective
than the single primary component.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is one of the big things that a
lot of sort of analytical chemistry and
[SPEAKER_09]: just Western medicine and science in
general has struggled with is the,
[SPEAKER_09]: the, the, the focus on principal component
analysis, which is that vitamin C is the
[SPEAKER_10]: same way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, vitamin C, if you make it
synthetically, it works or natural pure
[SPEAKER_10]: vitamin C works.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you take vitamin C and you extract
it from plant sources and you're getting
[SPEAKER_10]: the other associated compounds with it,
it's more effective.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and, and I think that the,
the, the, the focus on, honestly,
[SPEAKER_09]: this is for ease of analysis.
[SPEAKER_09]: On just looking at what makes up 90 or 95%
of the compound is like that gets you into
[SPEAKER_09]: the, not even the ballpark, but into the
city of where the ballpark is located for,
[SPEAKER_09]: for what's really driving all these,
all these effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's, it is a very important shortcut
to take, but then also once you've
[SPEAKER_09]: identified those, you know, that like,
what are the most, the key components that
[SPEAKER_09]: drive the most, most of the effects you
need to start branching out and looking at
[SPEAKER_09]: all of the attendant components that come
with it and why whole spectrum full
[SPEAKER_09]: spectrum extracts or, or, or, or plants
are more effective than single,
[SPEAKER_09]: like sort of single compound dose.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not true for everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's important to realize that,
but I think that in this case,
[SPEAKER_09]: there is enough evidence that we should
really start looking into this in great
[SPEAKER_09]: detail.
[SPEAKER_10]: Other research that I've always found
really interesting is why are some
[SPEAKER_10]: varieties of cannabis ceilingless?
[SPEAKER_10]: By that, I mean, no matter how much you
smoke, you always get higher when you
[SPEAKER_10]: smoke another joint or another pipe or
another down of that material,
[SPEAKER_10]: where some materials you smoke,
you smoke, you smoke, and then you get to
[SPEAKER_10]: the point where it'll kind of make you
more stone, but it won't make you more
[SPEAKER_10]: high.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know about everybody else,
but I don't want to get higher.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that, you know,
coming from my background, I love the
[SPEAKER_09]: community around it, but it gets me a
little bit wonky sometimes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the use of terms like high versus stone
versus heady versus, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: like body buzz, all those things like,
like trying to define.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is also because I'm very
particular about terms, but trying to
[SPEAKER_09]: define those in a way that gives us a sort
of a shared understanding that is,
[SPEAKER_09]: that is quantifiable that we can track it
and we can trace it and analyze it across
[SPEAKER_09]: different users and different strains is
really important.
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, this may be me being just a
little bit more picky.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what you said earlier about certain
strains and that's, that's, that was the
[SPEAKER_09]: other side of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the genetics of people that are
sort of an osmia, but there are also
[SPEAKER_09]: strains that simply don't, like if there
are chemo bars, let's focus on the proper
[SPEAKER_09]: terms, there are chemo bars that don't
express the same cannabinoids and they
[SPEAKER_09]: don't express the same aromatic balance.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we're interested in all of
these different, sort of the different
[SPEAKER_09]: strains and these different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, using those to,
using that variability as a feature rather
[SPEAKER_09]: than a bug, is what I like to do is like,
you know, let's celebrate the variation in
[SPEAKER_09]: between people and plants because we can
then, you know, create blends of these
[SPEAKER_09]: things that do, you know, everything we
want.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you could tune them, which is what I'm
really excited by is, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, taking the components that we
want and then from different strains and
[SPEAKER_09]: combining them to create something that is
not, not sort of expressed in the natural
[SPEAKER_09]: genetics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: As a plant breeder, I'm very interested in
knowing what it is that people prefer and
[SPEAKER_10]: why, so that I can breed a plant that's
tailored for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's interesting is we've been doing a
lot of accessions for studies of different
[SPEAKER_09]: chemo bars and working with Jeremy Plum,
I wish he was on this call because he'd
[SPEAKER_09]: start laughing right now, is the
perpenolene dominance that we're seeing in
[SPEAKER_09]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: market, recreational and hemp,
is massive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the point where, like, we're seeing a
loss, a potential loss of genetic
[SPEAKER_09]: diversity because people are selecting so
heavily for that perpenolene dominance
[SPEAKER_09]: because it applies, sort of, it actually,
or not actually, it lifts up the citrus,
[SPEAKER_09]: it lifts up the tropical and it lifts up
the diesel and gassy character so well
[SPEAKER_09]: that, and piney as well, that it seems
like we might be sort of selecting
[SPEAKER_09]: ourselves into a corner with the breeding
stock.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think it's really important to
not just go for what people currently
[SPEAKER_09]: want, but to also look at what we see
there are, sort of, attend with those,
[SPEAKER_09]: or not attend, that follow those clear
customer preferences.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we know that perpenolene is very,
very exciting for a lot of people and
[SPEAKER_09]: people judge that, oh, that smells
amazingly gassy and citrusy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, maybe they like something
that has a lot more tropical character and
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot more of the burnt rubber and guava
character that comes from the thyle,
[SPEAKER_09]: just to bring it full circle here,
and making sure that we can protect those
[SPEAKER_09]: genetics so that breeders like yourself
can combine them and produce something
[SPEAKER_09]: that has both.
[SPEAKER_10]: People have often asked me, what is the
best?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say, what do you mean by best?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you mean the strongest, the best
tasting, the best?
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you mean by the best?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because without understanding what they
mean by the best, there is no single best
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis for everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just isn't that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or for every situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There also needs to be a germplasm
institute to protect all the genetics so
[SPEAKER_00]: that there can be biodiversity of what
Nick is talking about, yet protecting and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding the other, you know,
characteristics that are still there that
[SPEAKER_00]: people have come to know and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is those don't exist
domestically and they don't exist in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to start thinking about
something like that so we can protect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, I mean, I have this genetic
tattooed on my arm, it's gone well over a
[SPEAKER_00]: decade, and it was one that helped many
patients that I wish had been saved,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's gone from the face of the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, Nick, you bring up a very real
point that we have to be protecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that we have, but also the
biodiversity that exists so that in future
[SPEAKER_00]: generations can understand much less
appreciate.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of hard, Jen, because to
maintain a germplasm for example,
[SPEAKER_10]: let's say you have just one land race.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time you reproduce that land race,
to not lose genes from that gene pool,
[SPEAKER_10]: you've got to have a minimum of 1,000
males and 1,000 females, every
[SPEAKER_10]: reproduction.
[SPEAKER_10]: And those 1,000 males, they can't be
clones all the same male.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got to be from seed, 1,000 males,
1,000.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you limit your loss to really,
really a small percentage.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, the only place that's really
done is in third world countries.
[SPEAKER_10]: People aren't growing thousands and
thousands of plants from seeds in the
[SPEAKER_10]: commercial cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very seldom done.
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be done, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that, Hash Churchers?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got work to do, get on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I think what Sam is saying is
like, I think it's important for people to
[SPEAKER_11]: keep running genetics and continue those
lines and not move on so fast and try to
[SPEAKER_11]: keep those lines in existence in seed
form.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's one thing I think, at least
commercially in terms of seeds,
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to really respect the individuals
that had 10 lines, that was it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's every year, that was it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they'd maybe introduce one or two
new lines, but not whole revisions and
[SPEAKER_11]: whole new drops of just completely
different things from clone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the seed companies in the world
can't even maintain clones for 20,
[SPEAKER_10]: 30 years for seed production.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you can't lose clones, how are you
going to save varieties?
[SPEAKER_11]: So Sam, back in the 90s when Ben Donker,
like you were there, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So at what time did those mother plants
start to be really difficult to obtain?
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it like the late 80s, late 90s?
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it difficult the whole time?
[SPEAKER_10]: Obtain them from who, from where?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand the question.
[SPEAKER_11]: How long did you, basically, when did
people like Sensei start losing their
[SPEAKER_11]: mother plants?
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably from day one.
[SPEAKER_10]: From day one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you keep a plant as a clone and
you keep it virus free, so keep the pests
[SPEAKER_10]: away, and it doesn't pick up more viruses,
which will cause it to lose vigor and
[SPEAKER_10]: vitality.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't see any difference between clones
30 years later, if you kept them clean,
[SPEAKER_10]: safe, and secure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's actually something that's
becoming a very large challenge right now
[SPEAKER_09]: because of the amount of unregulated
growth that's going around, and people are
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing the cuts and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the ways to do that is actually
through tissue culture, because you can
[SPEAKER_09]: actually preserve certain cells that don't
have the virus yet, and you can grow it
[SPEAKER_09]: from that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Companies like Segre and Power Plant are
doing this for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and a lot of- They work on the hop
late in viroids.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, and this is from my experience in
the hop industry, it's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's not a problem for hops as
much, but if you're growing cannabis near
[SPEAKER_09]: them or if you're processing the same
facility, there needs to be very,
[SPEAKER_09]: very good phytosanitary controls.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that, going back to the
preservation of genetics, one of the
[SPEAKER_09]: things that I've done in my own breeding
and curation is to try to always seed out
[SPEAKER_09]: genetics that I like for some,
for whatever particular reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I always keep the seeds of the crosses
that I'm not too happy about because there
[SPEAKER_09]: might be something that pops up in them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've got some genetics that have
abhorrent agronomic characteristics,
[SPEAKER_09]: so just they're terrible, they're spindly,
they're incredibly mite sensitive.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things I really do breed for is
powdery milled breweries, I don't like
[SPEAKER_09]: fungal resistance and downy milled
resistance, I just don't like fungal
[SPEAKER_09]: infections in my bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I actually do run sort of mite stress
tests on mine, so if you ever go into,
[SPEAKER_09]: whenever I'm in a breeding session,
you go into towards the end of it,
[SPEAKER_09]: everything's covered in mites,
and I'm just trying to see which one
[SPEAKER_09]: survived best.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's a risky category, most people
don't want to do that, I understand why,
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's a fun thing for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, tell the truth that you say you
did, that the truth of it is you just
[SPEAKER_10]: can't get rid of the little boogers.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, I introduced them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually drove somewhere with a spider
mite infestation in a hop field,
[SPEAKER_09]: took some and put it into my mite tent,
which is inside another tent.
[SPEAKER_10]: And have you found plants which were mite
resistant and didn't get mites?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it herpes?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very possible, I mean, I would say
that it's likely that it's something to do
[SPEAKER_09]: in the aromatic profile, but also that
their immune response is probably quicker.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have millions of plants in my life,
Nick, and I've grown thousands of
[SPEAKER_10]: different land ratios of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have never seen a plant that could not
get mites.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so there's not getting mites,
and then there's resisting mites at the
[SPEAKER_09]: load that is currently affecting other
plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they're always together in the same
tent.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the mites might go to other plants
over this particular cross.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen it myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen it with the Congo.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen lower levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congo in a room.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Way lower levels though, like 90% were on
the crop and maybe like 10% or less were
[SPEAKER_13]: on this other plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And speaking of resistance and
susceptibility, those important mildew
[SPEAKER_10]: papers came out where they found both
genes for susceptibility and genes for
[SPEAKER_10]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they found out that it's more
important to not have the susceptibility
[SPEAKER_10]: genes than it is to have the resistance
genes to avoid mildew in your plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, speaking of resistance, Brian,
you're working in a climate, I think,
[SPEAKER_11]: that is more challenging than anyone here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've been reading for years.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the East Coast, we have a tremendous
amount of rain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Today is a great example.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in the thick of a tropical event
that's just been broken up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's challenging.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sunny up here today, but it's really
windy, which isn't bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: The land I have here has opened up for
good air drainage, air flow.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to bring it up or ask anyone
if they've seen any resistance to botrytis
[SPEAKER_08]: from the limonene group.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen the lemon oriented types,
and I can't break down the science in
[SPEAKER_08]: terms of the breakdown for the family of
terpians, the profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've seen things in the lemon category
be very resistant into the later season
[SPEAKER_08]: for botrytis and resistance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I've seen this year out of a
whole list of types, I've actually seen
[SPEAKER_08]: only powdery mildew pop up late season on
the gas mask phenone number six back cross
[SPEAKER_08]: one, which is ironic because the mom
doesn't show that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's something reached out and is not
resistant in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But otherwise, it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: It came in late.
[SPEAKER_08]: And everything else, very, very clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been breeding it like five years
back here towards that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it shows with mildew being a challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I found it to be a challenge cultivar
specific, strain specific more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, so kind of leaning off of things
that might go that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm finding definitely in Maine that
more that the fruit forward, cookie back
[SPEAKER_08]: type still kind of working with that
complex of genetics with some other tie
[SPEAKER_08]: in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a whole list of some exploration
this year, which I can list off some
[SPEAKER_08]: strains that I'm working with,
since if that is interesting, anyone?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to breed against botrytis
also.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to do it in skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I grew several years and it was so
difficult that I gave up.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it definitely could be because if you
think about it, I never see botrytis in a
[SPEAKER_10]: variety like original haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm working with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wonder what comes down because
Brian, I really want to hear your strain
[SPEAKER_06]: list.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to add.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are people that want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also created 40 new varietals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everything that we did this year was
off a seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we did about 1,300 plants all
from seed, all our old varietals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then mixing in some others.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm wondering too, I wanted to bring
it into the conversation that maybe more
[SPEAKER_06]: than having to do with varietals because
we've been growing in this area for so
[SPEAKER_06]: long.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been adding to our soil for so long.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been getting it right for so long.
[SPEAKER_06]: We only do seed varietals.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll keep our clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll keep a mother maybe only because
we've grown it out from that year or
[SPEAKER_06]: something.
[SPEAKER_06]: But normally we'll just continue to grow
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just realized that now it's not
really mattering what varietal that we are
[SPEAKER_06]: working with.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we've been working with it for a long
time, because I think then that involves
[SPEAKER_06]: the endophytic relationship within the
plant that then goes into the seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think if they are building
something that's super resistant,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're building it through biology as
well, which hasn't necessarily been a part
[SPEAKER_06]: of this conversation up till now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think for varietals are part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think terpenes can maybe draw more
interesting things from the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: Higher lactic acid is drawn to more
lemmonine varietals.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've noticed that also, Brian,
but the endophytic reaction.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now it really seems like anything new
that we bring on to our property is what's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to get some kind of a reaction,
have some type of a malady in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it takes us several years to then
work with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then now we're getting to the point
where we are having hardly any.
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in an incredibly difficult
environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's super cold up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in an inland rainforest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this year we didn't have hardly any
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, and that's in stock and bud in early
and late.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just sort of goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the ones that we did have the problems
with were the ones that were early.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Brian, I want to roll right over to
you because I'd love to hear your list.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, we've had a great success
summer, too, for health, actually,
[SPEAKER_08]: and have really not seen much of any
botrytis really into this later finish.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're kind of a better cold, main,
sunny and breezy finish this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that helps.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the health is really up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would share one strain I saw that
was interesting is from Dominion Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_08]: from Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a local skunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how much skunk one it has in
there, but I was going to let Sam know
[SPEAKER_08]: that that one was actually a resistant and
a reparative strain where I say it cracked
[SPEAKER_08]: down the middle, even with some support
and did a little quick bind job.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this came back late season where it
looked like it was about to die off and it
[SPEAKER_08]: had great resistance repair, which I've
seen with hemp, but not as much with
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's got no mold.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no mold, no botrytis.
[SPEAKER_08]: No septoria.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's an old scratch pile compost
that had actually a sour best shit ever
[SPEAKER_08]: with a Romulan called Candy Coated that
took some septoria pretty hard,
[SPEAKER_08]: like almost the hardest in the yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Picked clean leaf, killed the spore colony
or tridu, and it came back on it right
[SPEAKER_08]: away.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on the back side of Black Dominus
super skunk seems to be throwing lay,
[SPEAKER_08]: but catching botrytis really kind of
quickly, otherwise looking healthy in this
[SPEAKER_08]: little three plant set of just
experimental run.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the dominions work there, the local
skunk, this one, you know, just really
[SPEAKER_08]: awesome gassy kind of skunky gas skunk or
sweet gas skunk more than just raunchy
[SPEAKER_08]: skunk, I would say.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, anyway, I have the strain list
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll read it off this year what we're
working with.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got some cherry chem.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a Tropicana kosher tangy on my
gas mask called Masquerade.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a strawberry lime fino of my Holy
Road.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got some 91 Royale and a grapefruit
skunk sided Holy Road.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a gas mask, bat cross one,
some Black Wilson Reserve, cough BX1,
[SPEAKER_08]: the Candy Coated Rom, SBSC.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got that local skunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guava mask is doing amazingly well,
just really kind of running the number of
[SPEAKER_08]: finos, not a whole ton, but enough of them
to get a good look on it and had great
[SPEAKER_08]: results there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the cherry mask is doing really well
also, and I would share back that the
[SPEAKER_08]: cherry chem was from South Fork Seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got given to me at an emerald cup right
before I came back here like six to seven
[SPEAKER_08]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: And usually see the indica sided stuff in
Maine kind of go like you might have
[SPEAKER_08]: mentioned with newer indica types
introduced to the land, even though we
[SPEAKER_08]: like some of them I've had to breed with
like a blackberry pie local cut to get the
[SPEAKER_08]: resistance out a year or two later from
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm seeing it even a year later.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, going back to it,
I've saw cherry chem this year from a seed
[SPEAKER_08]: fino that really showed such good health
that it did hit a septoria a little bit of
[SPEAKER_08]: challenge, which, you know, to bring it
up, septoria is like crushing trees that
[SPEAKER_08]: are 20, 30 feet tall now in Maine over the
last two years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the locals are talking about I walk
the woods and see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it seems like a climate change,
but a different conversation type of
[SPEAKER_08]: thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd get, you know, information from
the people on that one actually seems to
[SPEAKER_08]: be where we're at with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's like we're having to breed
through septoria.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fusarium and Fusarium too in the in your
areas and just just this area in New
[SPEAKER_11]: England.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been it's new for me in the last few
years.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, New York, New York, you never
had these types of things.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, yeah, we're having to treat,
you know, even reverse osmosis water has
[SPEAKER_11]: to be treated, you know, even with,
you know, going through systems.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's really challenging.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, you know, what you're doing
to.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing these different blights pop
up, Colin, like that, like this,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, septoria, Fusarium, I've seen
more septoria, but it's added a whole new
[SPEAKER_08]: level of not negative, but actually
positive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Movement for plant adaptation in the
breeding that we're doing with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing all that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm finding I'm breeding more for septoria
resistance now than any of the botrytis or
[SPEAKER_08]: PMs like old news.
[SPEAKER_08]: The tritus is hard in Maine, but the
septoria is such a kicker with even big
[SPEAKER_08]: trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other I can see it in nature take certain
types, not others.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm seeing it back to the plants with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not it's not strain specific.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's phenome specific.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen sisters touching each other like
McGraw-McCush and I documented it this
[SPEAKER_08]: year where it's literally knocked off.
[SPEAKER_08]: The flowers healthy, but the septoria hit
everything even with a clean out twice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just took it down early and it was
finished.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was on the index side thing too,
but the more sativa expressing sister
[SPEAKER_08]: right next door, touching it a foot and a
half away, not one touch of septoria on
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm kind of like having to breathe more
through that these days than anything
[SPEAKER_08]: else, but seeing things that are
resistant, you know, on one thing and not
[SPEAKER_08]: another.
[SPEAKER_08]: The light hit of septoria at the end on
cherry cam, but otherwise it like moved on
[SPEAKER_08]: from no mildew, no botrytis, even in the
second stage cut off the tops,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, right now checking it every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would share back to that as the
lemonine family.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then now into the, whatever cherry you
guys would know more makes up into the
[SPEAKER_08]: cherry pie on Chem D like I think it was
back across three or four on the Chem D
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's all cherry pie sided too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just got a little glass, you know,
gasless and it doesn't wash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Although you might be able to pull
something and it doesn't wash for us,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, but it's a, it's a flower
strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll come up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I was going to say, I got a few
goodies that I can't wait to like throw
[SPEAKER_08]: you away to see if you pull something off
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the grapefruit skunk Holy road,
you know, it goes back to that Calio skunk
[SPEAKER_08]: one cut from humble clone.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not like your typical tangy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, I'm at it with my all time
favorites.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it goes grapefruit skunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really great fruit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, grapefruit skunking.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I can't walk with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to interrupt, but I need to,
my flight's boarding in like seven
[SPEAKER_09]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I need to just say, I'll say,
say goodbye, but also in relation to this
[SPEAKER_09]: specific thing, if you look at the
obviously the lemonine and linalool
[SPEAKER_09]: dominant, so for citrus, there typically
is also a lot of alpha and beta pining.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sedrine and those combinations are
what make up pine stall.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of the sort of, or coniferous
oils that are used as antifungals.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I suspect that those will probably
have a lot of back on that and they taste
[SPEAKER_09]: great.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, as a target, like if you can
find any piney varieties, cross them with
[SPEAKER_09]: limiting varieties, you're probably going
to get a decent, a decent little sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: antifungal cocktail there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really wish I could stay on,
but I need to finish this and I would love
[SPEAKER_09]: to talk to you guys more.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have my email and likewise,
I'm going to see if I can reach out
[SPEAKER_09]: because this is a, this is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for sharing, Nick.
[SPEAKER_13]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a good solid three hours.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want, I wanted to hear a little bit more
from Wade because we haven't heard enough
[SPEAKER_13]: from Wade.
[SPEAKER_13]: How, how is everything going in Wade's
world right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Things are going pretty good in Wade's
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been loving this conversation and
seeing some of the faces and enjoying my
[SPEAKER_05]: dab rig here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, it occurred to me to try and do a
memory test and, and review what I've
[SPEAKER_05]: heard today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know early on in the conversation,
Kelly and Josh were talking about getting
[SPEAKER_05]: a letter from the EPA about their
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and it occurs to me to say that
that's a sign of respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: They recognize that you're actually doing
something in the market and to some extent
[SPEAKER_05]: you're a threat to an existing business
model.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the thoughts I had is that
conversation progressed was I live in
[SPEAKER_05]: California where we have an abundance of
rules and regulations for everything and
[SPEAKER_05]: especially cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be quite honest, in my opinion,
especially as a patient myself at a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: new serious level now in my life,
we've made a hot mess of legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really legalization, it's
commercialization.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that wanders off to a different topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to try again, like a memory
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: After, after that, we got into this thing
about science and nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think of science myself as,
and I'm not a paid scientist, Mark,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I understand your point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, science is really a method of
trying to understand nature in all its
[SPEAKER_05]: various aspects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything from the stars and the universe
that we live in to how our bodies work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we wouldn't know so much about how
cannabis has the effects it does in the
[SPEAKER_05]: body in addition to psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it weren't for science, I mean,
science wanted to learn about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_05]: did and has and has revealed an incredible
amount.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mark Scaldone, Dr. Mark Scaldone
pointed to a paper, I think he referenced
[SPEAKER_05]: CBDA and some of the effects that it's
had.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I'm a big fan, as you can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, after that, it went towards,
oh yeah, we got into thiols and the
[SPEAKER_05]: effects and their presence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sam was talking about doing the 25
milligrams THC and then adding a terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: one at a time, one day at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that kind of methodical approach
because that's science actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's especially if you keep track of
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Records, I'm sure Sam does, breathing into
scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just stunned at the breadth of
knowledge in this group of people that you
[SPEAKER_05]: invite, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a certain way, I feel very humbled
to sit here with you all today.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also feel inspired.
[SPEAKER_05]: My life has changed pretty dramatically in
the last year, but in a good way,
[SPEAKER_05]: because there was some health challenges
happening in my life four or five years
[SPEAKER_05]: ago that didn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't the person that I always thought
lived in this body.
[SPEAKER_05]: The body was going through some changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's part of getting old.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me, it was specifically a form of
cancer that has manifested in my bones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so on that conversation about science
and nature, I love nature very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've spent a good portion of my life
trying to understand how a garden works
[SPEAKER_05]: and what the diversity of nature can do
for a plant that I love very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now what I've found as a patient
myself is that in the regulated market in
[SPEAKER_05]: California, even in Nevada County,
which is where I live, I live between
[SPEAKER_05]: Nevada City and Grass Valley in the Sierra
foothills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even here where our local cannabis
alliance has created a program through the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole supply chain where any patient who
has a medical recommendation from their
[SPEAKER_05]: physician can get free product that's been
donated by the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the license holders in our area
contribute, not all of them, a good
[SPEAKER_05]: portion of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've taken advantage, I helped set
that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And over the last year, I have actually
taken advantage of that program quite a
[SPEAKER_05]: bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But even me with all of the people I know,
it's kind of hard to find versions of the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis plant chemistry in products where
I can get the couple of hundred milligrams
[SPEAKER_05]: that I want a couple of times a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really so much trying to control
my cancer because the, back to science for
[SPEAKER_05]: a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if this is too much information,
anybody interrupt.
[SPEAKER_05]: But back to science, I ended up in a
situation in a series of hospitals in
[SPEAKER_05]: December of last year, about coming on 10
months ago now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at one of them down in Stanford,
I got a course of radiation in one day,
[SPEAKER_05]: one dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: It worked wonders, at least my experience,
other than a sunburn around my mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my appetite improved, I slept better,
I was less pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And meantime, yeah, I was on a pretty
aggressive course of chemo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it kept me alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really grateful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a really renewed and profound sense
of how life really is a gift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your chance to be involved with your
family, to be involved in a community,
[SPEAKER_05]: back to the theme of this morning's
church.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea that we are, in fact,
a community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Wade sitting here on his little
patio, looking at my pond and these big
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful trees,
[SPEAKER_05]: in my situation, I feel really grateful,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many people who are better situated in
their life to be doing what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Multiple myeloma is the kind of cancer
that I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a specific bone marrow cell called a
plasmid.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only doesn't die off, makes insane
numbers of clones of itself and crowds out
[SPEAKER_05]: all the other types of bone marrow cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And meantime, bursts the bones from the
inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd be specific and gruesome,
but there it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So pain is a bit of an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that in my case, at least,
because every person's different,
[SPEAKER_05]: our metabolism, our body's needs,
our body's ability to respond to something
[SPEAKER_05]: like a cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a fascinating question to me
trying to understand because this is
[SPEAKER_05]: cancer of cells of the immune system.
[SPEAKER_05]: The effects of high dosage cannabis use,
and specifically in my case, of course,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm mixing CBD and THC and various
versions, ingesting as well as dabbing on
[SPEAKER_05]: my mini-napping.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, the combination of having done
some time trying to understand how my mind
[SPEAKER_05]: works through a form of Buddhism,
if you will, that I did for a number of
[SPEAKER_05]: years, through a really lifelong interest
in how things grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do things work?
[SPEAKER_05]: And specifically how do plants work?
[SPEAKER_05]: How does that happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you put a seed in the ground and
the combination of moisture and soil and
[SPEAKER_05]: sun produce this plant that feeds us or
provides these beautiful flowers,
[SPEAKER_05]: these incredible aromatic plants that can
have such profound effects on our
[SPEAKER_05]: experience?
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the meantime, here I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's true is my cancer seems to have
responded really well to treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point, I'm on a fairly low dose of
a chemotherapy drug, which so far,
[SPEAKER_05]: my oncologist is saying, no, you don't
want to stop it, Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the good results you're having.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's true, all my blood work's going
in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've known enough cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember who it was that
referenced that the patient is not really
[SPEAKER_05]: a great term for who we are, because yeah,
I've been a patient under California law
[SPEAKER_05]: for glaucoma since, well, before there was
such a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was diagnosed back in 94, 95.
[SPEAKER_05]: And anyway, cannabis, I love this plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the other points that I came to
mind to say is we've already looked at or
[SPEAKER_05]: can see in medicine, they have a high THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marinol is one of the names of it that you
can get prescribed to buy a doctor and get
[SPEAKER_05]: it in a hospital here in the United States
approved by the Food and Drug
[SPEAKER_05]: Administration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same is true with Epidialapse.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get it delivered to your home.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the reasons I am celebrating today,
despite all of the other...
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been dying a lot, but I really am.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are tires of attitude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because yeah, that made me, Epidialapse
made me think of a couple of the families
[SPEAKER_05]: that I know who have family members who
are dealing with severe epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them has been on our show a couple
of times here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your show, Marcus, thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Our show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forrest Heard, Speak of Community.
[SPEAKER_05]: He and his son Silas have had a huge
effect on the conversation about cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: in Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to Silas.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a boy, if you don't know the
story, I'll tell anybody that wants to
[SPEAKER_05]: hear it for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I met Forrest and Silas, Forrest,
yeah, Silas was seven years old and
[SPEAKER_05]: Forrest was at a public meeting where he
was showing pictures of his son in the
[SPEAKER_05]: hospital because he had just been told
that his son likely wouldn't make it to
[SPEAKER_05]: the age of 10 due to what was eventually
diagnosed as Lennox-Castot syndrome,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is you've got to have like 10
different kinds of seizures.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this kid was seizing a hundred times a
day or more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, today, for now, let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: September 11th of this past month is one
year since Silas had a seizure.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's still doing several hundred
milligrams of CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a specific cultivar we found back
in 2014 or 2015 called MediHaze.
[SPEAKER_05]: The results of it were published in
O'Shaughnessy in that issue that year
[SPEAKER_05]: called MediHaze.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, that specific version of
MediHaze, the seeds came from Europe,
[SPEAKER_05]: gave Silas really profound and immediate
relief from his seizures.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we still have a couple of,
I think we still have like a hundred and
[SPEAKER_05]: some grams of a high-potency extraction of
that oil that seems to work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that original cut, the clone has gone
for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Forrest did at one point try and
titrate Silas off of the dose of MediHaze
[SPEAKER_05]: that he was mixing into the other plant
oils he had access to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he started showing signs of a seizure
might be coming on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he went right back to using
MediHaze.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, there's a lot of good news
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Silas is now in high school.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually coming out of his shell
enough that he's doing dance class as a
[SPEAKER_05]: sophomore in high school.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a huge change and improvement
in his wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, the other story I just
wanted to say, one of the other reasons
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm feeling deep gratitude, I met a family
when, I don't know if Jan's still on the
[SPEAKER_05]: call, but back when Steep Hill moved from
Oakland to Berkeley, they did one of their
[SPEAKER_05]: first public facing events, invited a
whole bunch of their clients to come see
[SPEAKER_05]: their new place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went down there thinking I would
meet a bunch of farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Silly me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The place was full of people in Chinese,
big watches and shiny shoes and suits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was dressed like a farmer,
kind of like I am today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was one of like two or three people
in a crowd of a hundred or 200 that were
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I visited with the Reverend Dr.
Cameron and my friend, Fred Gardner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we shared nice food and the
conversation for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Cameron was pretty excited about it,
but I understand that's kind of closed
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met a family there that night.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the few folks that weren't in shiny
shoes and suits and whatnot was his family
[SPEAKER_05]: who had a young man in a wheelchair and he
was covered in a blanket and he had a mask
[SPEAKER_05]: on and he was in a catatonic state,
rictus, I think it's called.
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be the wrong term, but his
hands were clenched and his legs were
[SPEAKER_05]: locked up and he was in a fetal position.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I walked up to him and I asked him,
what are you all doing here?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were looking for somebody who
could grow some ACDC or might have some
[SPEAKER_05]: for their son who was 21 when I met this
family.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I won't name anybody because where
they live is actually still a threat to
[SPEAKER_05]: their home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because their community knows that they
use cannabis in California, homeowner
[SPEAKER_05]: associations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that family, they were there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some ACDC in my garden that year and
I had already figured out that its
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics did not do well in the hot,
dry summers of Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was discovered, if you will,
identified as a plant of interest over on
[SPEAKER_05]: the Mendocino coast, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my understanding of the story
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where there's a lot of moisture in the air
and the peak heat in the summers might get
[SPEAKER_05]: into the 80s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here we just flirted with a hundred
here and single digit humidity levels this
[SPEAKER_05]: past summer for at least a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And anyway, ACDC was not doing well in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I said, well, if you're looking for
CBD, I have some because I was already
[SPEAKER_05]: starting to I was creating a product we
called Wonder Drops.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a 25 to one and I was so proud of
it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a label, had all the milligrams and
it was tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had 350 milligrams of CBD, 14
milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every one of those milligrams came
from my garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And meantime, we had hundreds and hundreds
of these bottles going out to a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensaries up and down California at one
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I handed it to mom because she was
the one who was really engaged on the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, yeah, this is exactly what
he needs, but he would need two of these a
[SPEAKER_05]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went, wow, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the daughters of the family has
engaged with an indoor operation that
[SPEAKER_05]: allows them to preserve some of the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found a specific high CBD, low THC
version that did well in our neighborhood
[SPEAKER_05]: called Remedy and another version of
similar genetics called Therapy that
[SPEAKER_05]: passed through here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both of those did quite well for that
young man who is now just turned 30.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, his family is now providing
his oils for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the mother and one of the other sons
of that family came to visit to tell me
[SPEAKER_05]: how well they were doing and to give
thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's why we do this work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I love the cannabis plant
personally for the psychoactive effects
[SPEAKER_05]: that Sam is such a devotee of and most of
us are.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also love her for some of the other
effects that I have seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to loop back into the
conversation that we've been having here
[SPEAKER_05]: and to stop taking up so much time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Science helps me and us understand the
magic, if you will, that is nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a deep wisdom in nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we take the time to look, the fellow
who's doing that series of books teeming
[SPEAKER_05]: with microbes, teeming with fungi,
teeming with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's his name.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's pointing in a really great direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: The woman who's recognizing the importance
of mother trees and regeneration of
[SPEAKER_05]: forests.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those of us, Kelly and Josh, who are
pointing to the importance of living soil
[SPEAKER_05]: and regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went into regenerative practices
myself a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, because I didn't want it to reduce
the impact of my indoor gardening in San
[SPEAKER_05]: Francisco when I was doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I came up here, because
despite doing wonder drops, I was still
[SPEAKER_05]: given a lot of my product away because
when somebody's sick, how can you tell
[SPEAKER_05]: them they have to pay you?
[SPEAKER_04]: For what you have, it might save the life
of their child.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's my testimony, if you will,
for today on Hash Church is my gratitude
[SPEAKER_05]: for the love that is this plant and what
she offers to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think of her as a manifest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I go into God for a second?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in discussion with my friend Swami
Chaitanya of Swami Select, he's a full
[SPEAKER_05]: Hindu holy guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've known him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I talk spirituality sometimes,
and it's really far out to dig into the
[SPEAKER_05]: Vedic traditions of spirituality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we, if you will, also argued for a
while back and forth about if there is
[SPEAKER_05]: God, what is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was what we arrived on that I like
is God is the sum total of all sentience,
[SPEAKER_05]: not just in humans, but humans play a huge
part, at least on this planet,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the trees and the rocks and crystals,
the fish, literally the fungi the bacteria
[SPEAKER_05]: in the air that we breathe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of that all the way out to all the
stars and galaxies and everything that we
[SPEAKER_04]: can conceive of where there is sentience
contributes to what we think of as God.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can find God within yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find it by looking at flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find it by
[SPEAKER_02]: coming deep
[SPEAKER_02]: and do that to the best of your ability.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Marcus, I want to really call you out
and appreciate you for pointing to the
[SPEAKER_05]: importance of only smoking and using the
best that you can make or find of whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: it is you're taking to help your life feel
the way you want it to feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that was a long, stoned wrap.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for the platform,
the opportunity, the community,
[SPEAKER_05]: because yeah, this is, to me, at heart
really about what cannabis was always
[SPEAKER_05]: about.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we were all hiding and were,
you know, used to be when you met with the
[SPEAKER_05]: group of cannabis activists, it was the
news was about who'd gotten busted.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was their trial looking like?
[SPEAKER_05]: What were the charges, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, you know, it's about taxes and
what's the new VCC regulations going to
[SPEAKER_05]: look like and how is Appalachians of
origin going to work and yada,
[SPEAKER_05]: yada, yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've come so far and we still got a
long way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still got a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to call out a thing that's
happening next weekend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do, you're going to do
another church next weekend, Marcus,
[SPEAKER_05]: but a group of hashmakers, some of the
beautiful Rostins and whatnot I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: hitting on here this morning and all week
have been, some of them come to me through
[SPEAKER_05]: the donation program, but some of them
come to me through folks who aren't really
[SPEAKER_05]: licensed or permitted to do so,
but are, if you will, sharing their
[SPEAKER_05]: personal use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to say, because I'm really stoned.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I wanted to do that memory test
to see if I were how stoned I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll have to go back and listen to
this at some point, but I really do feel
[SPEAKER_05]: deep gratitude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am getting stronger every day is how it
feels to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will point to most of my cannabis use at
this point is focused on my enjoyment of
[SPEAKER_05]: the day, particularly as how it relates to
pain management.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I want to be able to move around and
I can do it for a little while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sitting this long has been an interesting
challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing great at the moment because I'm
really stoned and it helps a lot with
[SPEAKER_05]: pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I also ingest quite a bit because
I find that especially for long-term
[SPEAKER_05]: relief, if I don't want to have my dad rig
fired up and going all day long right next
[SPEAKER_05]: to the bed or out on the patio like I am
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm taking some what's colloquially
known as RSO.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, next Sunday, next Sunday,
a group of folks is going to gather here
[SPEAKER_05]: at my farm and we're going to celebrate
Hash in the same way that we are doing
[SPEAKER_05]: here today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I'm not even sure what time
we're gathering next week, but we're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: a half stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The neurosurgery people still want me to,
they have their hooks in me back to
[SPEAKER_05]: science and nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing everything I can to heal my
bones because again, this kind of cancer
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of blows them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was a very, very, very,
very long-winded way of saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: actually, I'm doing really good for anyone
that wants to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Deep gratitude here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, I'm kind of stunned.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a big part of that is, hey,
I survived.
[SPEAKER_05]: What looked like might be a not survivable
moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's pretty far out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for working with us and our
veterans as well, because not only have
[SPEAKER_00]: you been sick, you've been working with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Etienne, I really want to appreciate you
for calling me out on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, again, in the same way that this
has been an incredible nourishment to me
[SPEAKER_05]: today, I don't usually say a lot in the
Veterans Action Council meetings and I
[SPEAKER_05]: certainly don't make them all because
yeah, there's a lot of drama going on here
[SPEAKER_05]: on the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, me personally, I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, heroic effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys did last, what, two weeks ago
now?
[SPEAKER_05]: 12 veterans and spouses of veterans going
to Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: and putting in the time and the footwork.
[SPEAKER_05]: 12 miles, you said, over two days on
concrete.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stone, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And meantime, because you're veterans,
I'm a veteran too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I'm sitting in on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I feel humbled to be in the company
of folks that are on the Veterans Action
[SPEAKER_05]: Council.
[SPEAKER_05]: Myself, I joined the Navy to avoid being
drafted to go to Vietnam because I was of
[SPEAKER_05]: the era where my draft number,
we had a lottery in place at that point
[SPEAKER_05]: and I was number 34.
[SPEAKER_05]: And meantime, it didn't want to take
student loans.
[SPEAKER_05]: College, I went for a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_05]: It made no sense to me at all what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I quit that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I ended up joining the Navy on a
Saturday and my notice to report for
[SPEAKER_05]: induction would have meant you're in the
Army now and going to Vietnam,
[SPEAKER_05]: hello, boy, arrived on that following
Monday.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had already signed a contract to
join the Navy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And meantime, yeah, the Navy and I didn't
belong, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They kicked me out at my request.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another long story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Etienne and I will write my bio for
the Veterans Action Council thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you've asked me a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm humbled.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the company of people like yourself,
or Al Byrne or Michael Krowitz or Todd
[SPEAKER_05]: Scattini.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just go down the list.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Pearson Crosby.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thoughtful, impassioned people who are
really a lot on the same page we are
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to change the laws, trying to
educate the people who actually can change
[SPEAKER_05]: the laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think to your point earlier,
Etienne, local is where you can really be
[SPEAKER_05]: changed to bear.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there it's at least partially about
making the story personal.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you can touch people's hearts,
you can change their minds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that note, I'm gonna stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to come back if you're doing
it again, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually do have a science question
for you, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I send, I think I still have an email
for you and or Sam about, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I could pick, we should
take it offline or take it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Far away.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have it, probably other people are
thinking the same damn thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you referenced, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't mind, Marcus, I am kind of
bound by an agreement not to get too
[SPEAKER_05]: specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start there.
[SPEAKER_05]: A state health department in a certain
state is struggling with the fact that a
[SPEAKER_05]: limited number, this is in the United
States, a limited number of their licensed
[SPEAKER_05]: producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the sake of conversation,
we'll say there's 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Four or five of them, in the last few
months have consistently started popping
[SPEAKER_05]: up with analogs of Delta 9, Delta 10,
Delta 6, probably some OHCC, I think you
[SPEAKER_05]: referenced.
[SPEAKER_05]: And products that typically shouldn't have
it like in flour or in other products at
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrations that are completely
inappropriate for something that hasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: been treated in some way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meantime, the rest of the licensed
producers in this state are not having
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Department of Health's response to
this is to just have the manufacturers who
[SPEAKER_05]: are producing product that have these
analogs at a sufficient concentration to
[SPEAKER_05]: put it on their packaging and labeling as
one of the cannabinoids in the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I personally feel a strong objection
to that, but I would love to hear your or
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam's thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously to me, it's a public health
and safety issue because we don't really
[SPEAKER_05]: know what these analogs do as well as what
else is along for the ride when those
[SPEAKER_05]: analogs are in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can pipe in really short and fast that
we don't find 10 or eight when we're
[SPEAKER_10]: looking at our lab.
[SPEAKER_10]: So something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you say, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is prohibition economics at work.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it costs a lot of money to
put THC into a product.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the cheapest, the guy who can do that
for the cheapest makes the most money in a
[SPEAKER_12]: free market economy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if we're just talking about
cannabinoids in general.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, we were talking about this
earlier.
[SPEAKER_12]: This loophole that's in the farm bill that
legalized industrial hemp, which is CBD
[SPEAKER_12]: blessing and occurs because I think I have
said it before on hash church,
[SPEAKER_12]: as long as there's there's there's
prohibition anywhere, there'll be a black
[SPEAKER_12]: market everywhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what that means is that legal licensed
producers have to somehow economically
[SPEAKER_12]: keep up to have a competitive product in
the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if the only knob they have to turn is
the cost of their ingredients,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, you could basically make THC
cheaper from readily abundantly available
[SPEAKER_12]: CBD isolate and a chemical conversion.
[SPEAKER_12]: Put that into your products cheaper than,
you know, hire a team, the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_12]: grow cannabis, extract cannabis,
make cannabis oil, put it in the gummies.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cheaper just to buy the commodity,
mix it into the gummy and you're there
[SPEAKER_12]: quicker, cheaper, better, quicker.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think it's interesting because
different states are taking different
[SPEAKER_12]: approaches to this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they realize that I think,
again, this can only happen because of
[SPEAKER_12]: prohibition of Delta nine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if Delta nine was available and
everybody was making Delta nine across the
[SPEAKER_12]: board in the entire country and even in
the entire world.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: We wouldn't there wouldn't be a need for
Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_12]: This Delta eight market came up from the
farm bill and the fact that in the
[SPEAKER_12]: language of the farm bill, they only
reference what they did.
[SPEAKER_12]: The farm bill removes industrial hemp from
the Controlled Dangerous Substance Act.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's defined as cannabis with less
than 0.3 percent Delta nine THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was no mention about Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they never contemplated the fact that,
you know, Roger Adams first did it in the
[SPEAKER_12]: 40s and then Mishulam redid it back in the
70s is that you could chemically convert
[SPEAKER_12]: CBD into THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you do that conversion under
certain conditions, you get to Delta
[SPEAKER_12]: eight, which they don't mention in the in
the in the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what's now complicated things is that
because Delta eight is actually mentioned
[SPEAKER_12]: in the Controlled Dangerous Substance Act,
now they're hydrogenating that Delta eight
[SPEAKER_12]: and making HHC.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where HHC comes from.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're like, well, HHC is not on the
Controlled Dangerous Substance Act.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, be that as it may,
this is all made possible because of the
[SPEAKER_12]: ridiculousness of prohibition itself.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you're if you're making a
psychoactive substance in a chemical
[SPEAKER_12]: reaction vessel, it's different than
extracting it from a plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's different than from nature itself.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you get that whole spectrum.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you make Delta eight, you're
semisynthesizing it from CBD, which is
[SPEAKER_10]: illegal under the Controlled Substance
Act.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, it might fit through the
loophole of the Farm Act, but Delta eight
[SPEAKER_10]: is not legally produced.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we're we're we're we're we're CBD
runs into issues.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, they never contemplated this.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think, Sam, my feeling again,
you know, all your work and everything
[SPEAKER_12]: that went into GW's Epidiolex besides is
that is that is that the legislature's got
[SPEAKER_12]: snookered on seeds, rope and oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they they're like CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't care about CBD, just THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: We only care about THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the only thing that went into the
language of the bill.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think they realize that,
again, CBD being the active ingredient of
[SPEAKER_12]: an FDA approved drug.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's another law called the FD&C Act,
which is the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what that what that law says,
which is enforced by the FDA, is that the
[SPEAKER_12]: active ingredient of an FDA approved drug
cannot be used in food, feed or cosmetic
[SPEAKER_12]: or topical use for interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's interesting that they put that
interstate commerce in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what they need to do is they need to
make an exception to the FD&C Act.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I think they've done for like things
like caffeine.
[SPEAKER_12]: So caffeine is like an active ingredient
in drugs and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's also in Coca-Cola and Mountain
Dew and all that other shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they made an exception to the FD&C Act.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think caffeine actually got
grandfathered, but I think there's other
[SPEAKER_12]: examples of things that the FDA approved
as active ingredients but are OK to use.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you'll know and Wade knows this in
spades is that what Charlotte Webb,
[SPEAKER_12]: the company Charlotte's Web did,
I don't know if the Stanley Brothers
[SPEAKER_12]: anymore or not, but the company
Charlotte's Web said, OK, fine,
[SPEAKER_12]: we'll submit CBD extracts as a dietary
supplement from hemp.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because industrial hemp, right,
cannabis with lower than 0.3 percent THC
[SPEAKER_12]: was removed from the Control Danger
Substance Act.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the farm bill enabled now the
production of hemp.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, well, OK, hemp is an
agriculturally produced food, I guess,
[SPEAKER_12]: in a matter of speaking.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can make seed oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can make seed protein from it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's essentially a food and there's
different regulation.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the USDA, the Department of
Agriculture, only cares to the point where
[SPEAKER_12]: the crop is grown.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So all the amendments that go on the land,
whether it's organic, non-organic and all
[SPEAKER_12]: about farming and agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the USDA kind of washes their hands
after that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It sort of becomes the FDA's bailiwick to
pick up.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, now that corn has been grown,
now it goes to market.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're going to if you're Del Monte and
you want to make cans of corn because
[SPEAKER_12]: that's what you do with corn.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need an FDA inspected facility,
certain levels of quality and production
[SPEAKER_12]: standards that have to be held to because
you're making a variable agricultural
[SPEAKER_12]: product that's being put into these Del
Monte cans of corn that people are eating.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, I mean, I I think we're where
this goes, again, is this run into big
[SPEAKER_12]: corporations because now you're talking
about industrial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're talking about Archer's Daniel
Midland.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're talking about big chemical
companies that bought the seed companies
[SPEAKER_12]: that that engineered seeds to be resistant
to the chemicals that they sell.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: So like we were talking earlier,
the the EPA regulates that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know that USDA regulates the
genetically modified soybeans and corns
[SPEAKER_12]: that are grown today.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I've said it before, I think.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, Marcus, you agree that one of
the big drivers for hemp to overtake
[SPEAKER_12]: soybeans is going to be on protein
production per acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: When it comes down to it, if you need to
grow protein, you need to grow this crop
[SPEAKER_12]: because this crop produces way more
protein per acre than soybeans.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it requires less chemicals.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when you say less chemicals,
now those chemical companies get upset
[SPEAKER_12]: because they want to sell the chemicals.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, not just the protein.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also the fact that you simultaneously
create oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're producing protein.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when you're defatting the protein,
you're creating oil simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's it's too product.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to say thank you to Wade.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't think that was too long at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was so good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the whole recap of the hash church
that we had.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the update of how you were doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I'm not the only one because I
heard read a ton of people in the chat
[SPEAKER_13]: saying, I've been thinking a lot about
Wade lately.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always think a lot about you,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's it's just nice to hear your
humanity.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know how you feel things because when
you speak, you you you get us to feel the
[SPEAKER_13]: things that you feel.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very profound and powerful tool
that you have at your disposal.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's it's it couldn't have been a
better part of hash church for you to
[SPEAKER_13]: share everything that you did.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, I'll do a hash church next
week and we'll talk to you and all the
[SPEAKER_13]: hash makers that are coming by your farm.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm really glad to hear that you're
getting better and that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: I know things were rough there for a
while.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was following the updates on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just glad that you've been able to
get through all of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, you're still in it,
but get through the sort of the I don't
[SPEAKER_13]: know what it is when we're going through
those things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, lack of hope.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, but just you're such a positive,
vibrant person.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I appreciate I appreciate you sharing
with us in on hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is it is our show, not my show.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's community again, again.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an industry, but it's at heart,
really.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a community.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: And on that note, I think I'm going to
wrap it up for this week.
[SPEAKER_13]: So many wonderful people to come in and
share the vibes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Last minute often, you know, got to really
thank all of you for coming and doing this
[SPEAKER_13]: every time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm realizing more and more how much I
need it myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's terrible to sometimes feel like I
don't have time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to sacrifice going to see my son
skating, you know, that this is a skating
[SPEAKER_13]: lesson time.
[SPEAKER_13]: So and I'm sure there's sacrifices for all
of you to be made as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't go unseen or unfelt.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thank the more than 200 people that
have been watching with us since we
[SPEAKER_13]: started at nine a.m.
[SPEAKER_13]: for almost four hours of what I just
thought was awesome conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to dissect it, maybe listen to
it again and maybe create specific hash
[SPEAKER_13]: church has churches for the specific
conversations that we had because there
[SPEAKER_13]: was at least four or five really good
ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big thanks to Valerie Corral for coming
on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big thanks for Hillary Black for showing
up when she's not feeling the best in the
[SPEAKER_13]: chat room and sharing a bit of her vibes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to shout out Ron, one of my OG
mentors who was in the room as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: There he is right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: He just chimed in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to you, Ron.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully we can have you come on one day
and tell some stories.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, young man, Sam,
Dr. Mark, best friend, Farms, Colin and
[SPEAKER_13]: Wade and the Dragonfly Earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Love you all.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will see you all hopefully again
next week.
[SPEAKER_13]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: May the full melt bless your bowl sooner
than later.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ciao for now.
