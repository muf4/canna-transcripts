[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Today's episode of Puff Wednesday takes
Bubble Man and John Berfalo to Grouse
[SPEAKER_12]: Mountain, where they vape their way up the
gondola overlooking the beautiful city of
[SPEAKER_12]: Vancouver, hitting bowls left,
right and center under zip lines and above
[SPEAKER_12]: and beyond.
[SPEAKER_12]: Join us, won't you, for this beautiful
epic drone footage, wonderful grizzly
[SPEAKER_12]: habitats where bears are wandering around,
and pretty epic carvings I don't mind
[SPEAKER_12]: saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: We made our way past the carvings and we
saw some beautiful snow machines ready to
[SPEAKER_12]: get those runs agroomed.
[SPEAKER_12]: More grizzly bears.
[SPEAKER_12]: Puff Wednesday, won't you join us?
[SPEAKER_12]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome to Bubble Man's world and welcome
to Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_12]: Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this is our third Puff Wednesday
in a row.
[SPEAKER_12]: John and I have not dropped the ball.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, albeit last week's episode was fairly
epileptic.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was Max Hedrum.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, what's with the Hedrum thing?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's with my camera.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't take proper... I don't know
if I don't take proper care of things or
[SPEAKER_12]: if I use things really...
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you and me use things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we really... And if it breaks
then that's because we use it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Two years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, 640 videos.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully we'll get as many out of this
one, but we've got a good Puff Wednesday
[SPEAKER_12]: lined up for you today.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were thinking about all the different
things we could do and we thought we were
[SPEAKER_12]: going to finally go do the grouse gondola.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take them up to the top of Grouse
Mountain.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a huge gondola, not private and small
like the one in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're finger crossed.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to get the gondola by
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_12]: If not, we'll go up to the top of the
mountain and have a couple of nice
[SPEAKER_12]: sessions in the bush with you guys,
show you the city view, maybe even fly the
[SPEAKER_12]: drone a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man, it's so gorgeous out today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably the best day to take a look
at Vancouver from where you guys are about
[SPEAKER_09]: ready to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the meantime, why don't we have a
sesh, dude?
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's start Puff Wednesday off with a
sesh.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what happens when you're at home.
[SPEAKER_09]: We carry the propane torch.
[SPEAKER_12]: You carry the propane torch.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, John's not messing around with the
torch here today.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like the click.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so we got a little bit of rosin
here that I made a couple of days ago on
[SPEAKER_12]: my sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've got the Jamaican terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got the timer ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's important that when you do this that
you time and we talked about this with a
[SPEAKER_09]: perfect flavor for that perfect bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: First, you want to find out what the
perfect time for your nail is because
[SPEAKER_12]: quartz and titanium and ceramic and
sapphire all have different times that you
[SPEAKER_12]: want to wait.
[SPEAKER_12]: In particular, the ceramic.
[SPEAKER_12]: It takes an enormous amount of time,
almost twice the amount of time than these
[SPEAKER_12]: quartz ones.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's probably good.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's orange.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Color blind.
[SPEAKER_12]: Going to give you a little dip.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you dipping me?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to give you a little dip in the
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_12]: And these are some of the CRD types.
[SPEAKER_12]: Terps from Jamaica, our company in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: People are wondering, what's going on with
your company, guys?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we're producing terpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're gearing up to get our licenses so we
can process.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have ganja fields that are currently
protected under the Rastafarian banner,
[SPEAKER_12]: which we are also doing a project with
them in the University of West Indies.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are things happening with CRD.
[SPEAKER_12]: We may not talk about it a lot,
but we've gotten to the point with it
[SPEAKER_12]: where we really want to do more than talk
about what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm at 37.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here you go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamaican terps.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamaican terps.
[SPEAKER_12]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: So nice filming these Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's like every week we want to
do something fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to take you guys, if you have any
suggestions and there's something in BC
[SPEAKER_12]: that you've always wanted to see or
experience.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we're going to start stepping
Puff Wednesdays up from gondolas to float
[SPEAKER_12]: planes to Cessnas and helicopters.
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to take you guys to the next spot,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just took me to that next spot?
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you've got a nice hit there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those Jamaican terps, you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's terpenes and then there's Blue
River Terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the night and day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Night and day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the taste.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really simple, John.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're using buds.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know it from the hash making
world.
[SPEAKER_12]: People that are, you know, nug run became
a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like because it's different from trim run.
[SPEAKER_12]: You produce a different grade,
especially if you're trying to get your
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenes off of slabs of oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: These things aren't going to be quite on
the same level as taking beautiful pounds
[SPEAKER_12]: of organically grown cannabis and
processing them into terpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Morpheus.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got your... Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hitting the ball rig.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: That was probably one of my most epic lies
of a bond.
[SPEAKER_09]: You were in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was sitting there session with high
integrity.
[SPEAKER_09]: Darren was there and somehow I'm a proud
owner of that mothership.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't surprise me, to be honest,
because when I first got my mothership and
[SPEAKER_12]: Darren had all the sheech glass and you
had a variety of different things,
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a feeling that once you guys saw the
mothership, I mean, Ro's done that for the
[SPEAKER_12]: whole of the community.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like so many people.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it was Flav or Ro who hit me the
first time with one and I was like,
[SPEAKER_12]: whoa, this is like another level.
[SPEAKER_12]: This isn't just, it's not just a hype
thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's actually a quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you tell me where I'm at?
[SPEAKER_12]: 48.
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to go a little low temp.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got the carb caps so that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's like one of those things
that I got, I got, I got to do something
[SPEAKER_09]: different this weekend.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to learn how to pull a glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to get on a torch and it was pretty
cool and I got to make a mushroom handy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the best combination of the sour
diesel and rosin that I've had.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, did you do sour diesel or did you do
the Jamaican?
[SPEAKER_12]: Sour diesel is Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sour diesel, white cookies and crown
royal, all cultivars that we processed in
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the rosin mixture of the two,
that made for a really nice hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the turps that I've tried in the
past and from those sun grown ones in
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamaica, that's, those are good.
[SPEAKER_09]: The flavor is kind of more at home.
[SPEAKER_12]: All I'll say is this, from the smells,
they have a more subtle smell than Cush
[SPEAKER_12]: cleaner, cherry AK 47, Karma's bitch,
Mojito.
[SPEAKER_12]: These are very strong.
[SPEAKER_12]: Grab you immediately and you're just like,
Whoa, these turps have a lesser smell.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I got to say that that was one of the
best flavor rips that I've had from the
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamaican terpene since I've been hitting
them.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we did.
[SPEAKER_12]: So why don't we do one more each?
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you want to try the white
cookies or the crown royal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm into the white cookies.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not much of a crown royal guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but the white cookies.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going deep on the white cookies,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just dip too far.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why I'm not heating up the
thing here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I went back and you were talking
about Flav and the epic glass and stuff
[SPEAKER_09]: like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It really changed everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the guy's got amazing glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have great collections,
you know, and I remember collecting.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember collecting back in the day,
but it's taken on a whole new meaning
[SPEAKER_12]: these days.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's about collecting.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's about getting that proper
bomb that hits nicely.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why this is perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well for you, I mean Flav's a collector.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's well beyond the perfect bong that
hits perfectly and well into.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, there's lots of people like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Beyond epic shit in his collection.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have to do I'll do a show with Flav
in the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully where we go do a little bit of a
glass review.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the meantime, in the meantime,
it's all about Puff Wednesday and it's all
[SPEAKER_12]: about getting this white cookies,
raws and colab into Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm rambling the turps and these little
colabs and how they help out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that orange?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's orange.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get your timer.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're having a good puff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to talk more about some
epic like when we take him on that next
[SPEAKER_09]: little ride, you guys are going to be
like, really?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, this is a beautiful place that we're
going to.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's overlooking Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of the three local mountains.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have Cypress, Seymour and Grouse.
[SPEAKER_12]: Grouse is also known for the Grouse grind,
which is about a 50 to 55 minute cruise up
[SPEAKER_12]: to the top of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not going to do that today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people it takes hours.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people do it in 40 minutes,
but we're going to get on the gondola,
[SPEAKER_12]: pay the piper and just ride that Gandhi up
nice and slow and give you guys some nice
[SPEAKER_12]: footage out the windows.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I'm looking forward to this one
today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Give it a clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're kind of well past cleaning this
particular one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just told John the importance of
cleaning the courts on these swings
[SPEAKER_12]: because they are, they are quite
expensive.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hundreds of dollars, three, four or $500
sometimes depending on the color of the
[SPEAKER_12]: dial and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's good if you can just hit the
low temp dabs and then I of course,
[SPEAKER_12]: brought my Q tips.
[SPEAKER_12]: I bring them everywhere I go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just given that quick little white makes
all the difference in the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can really tell the difference
when you're hanging out with someone who's
[SPEAKER_12]: OCD about their court swing, which I know
after today, Johnny B is going to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we can pull this out because I've
pulled this court piece out that can be
[SPEAKER_09]: replaced.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just this dial.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all different colors.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have gold, silver, purple,
green.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I should get a red one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Generally.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Generally for the swing and the dial,
you're looking at about 400 bucks and then
[SPEAKER_12]: a cut, you know, two, 200 more for the
bucket and a couple hundred more for the,
[SPEAKER_12]: they're definitely not cheap.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what, for me, um,
I definitely, uh, got really, really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, uh, all business and we were
talking about different ways of
[SPEAKER_09]: advertising and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean expenses were put to where very
useful.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't have to justify your pipe,
dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shit bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's your pipe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you light me up?
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and in fact, I love it as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love hooking up with you and being able
to hit off of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know how great, I mean,
I love your pipe, so we're going to hit
[SPEAKER_09]: yours when we get up to the next level.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll take it up to gross with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: How was the white cookies?
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, that was the first one was nice
and smooth and really like nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: That one there, it was like, Oh,
it hit me hard.
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting that you'd say that because
the white cookies hit Remo so hard on the
[SPEAKER_12]: video.
[SPEAKER_12]: We did a couple of, like about a week ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had smoked 10 in a row, but during the
white cookies, he was coughing.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was, and that goes to show you,
it has nothing to do with any residual
[SPEAKER_12]: foods or chemicals or anything because
that was the same rosin that we hit
[SPEAKER_12]: through each one.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just hit the same rosin, but by merely
changing the terpene profile, you can
[SPEAKER_12]: really change how much it makes you cough.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking red.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you got a bit of a ride ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_12]: 110%.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got like 45 minutes to get to gross.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that definitely go terpenes in that
particular, as you can see it hit me hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: The white cookies.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love when you get super baked in this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: The last time we went to the gondola on in
Squamish, you said an amazing thing and I,
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, you know, uh, you got to get
the bubble in there when the bubble has
[SPEAKER_12]: the mouth.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it was just a really unique thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I, I kind of, I wrote some text
over and I was like, did you guys catch
[SPEAKER_12]: that?
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I, I rewound it and played it
again.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I personally appreciate those
profound, profound Johnny B moments.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I get to hang out with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you guys, that's like, so like now the
sun's going to break this sun in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the view and I think the next
term, because we did the white cookies,
[SPEAKER_12]: we have one last one to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the, uh, the crown royal,
but I think we'll take it to gross.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we'll take that one and hit it on
gross.
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're lucky, I have both pens.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have my herb pen and my concentrate
pencil.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's waste not another minute.
[SPEAKER_12]: My friend, let's take our friends and head
to the mountain.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have arrived here at gross mountain.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a ton of people, tourists from all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's doubtful that we're going to get a
gondola because they're so big and you
[SPEAKER_12]: have to wait 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll probably, we'll be able to film a
little bit of it for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe the whole thing for that matter,
but we're not going to be able to have a
[SPEAKER_12]: big session.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we figured we would get the grasshopper
and the Omicron going here while we,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, you know, have our little pre-session
before we get on the ground.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you said you brought some herb.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So a little chamber.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to jam some powder in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it looks nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, you want to maintain it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: How convenient that is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just it's got some convenience to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't use her very often.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go with, uh, keeps it fresh.
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't pack this too, too tight.
[SPEAKER_09]: The big one might be a little too big for,
might have to change that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Use the fingers a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's definitely not a flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that one's not for flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one I'm going to pop on.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one I'm actually going to be
popping on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, at least we both have agreed to
something.
[SPEAKER_09]: We both want to pop on the one with the
salt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Find you.
[SPEAKER_09]: We love the herb.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not dishing the herb.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm dissing it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to just disappear too.
[SPEAKER_12]: This grasshopper is easy.
[SPEAKER_12]: You click it once.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get the, you get the red lights on the
bottom and they'll go blue in a few
[SPEAKER_08]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_08]: One, two.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't take very long.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mine's funny enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I'm just going to pop it off my head.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nice and slow, you know, slow pulse
at first.
[SPEAKER_12]: The slower you pull just like this,
the bigger rips you get.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a pretty good one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely a favorite.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_12]: So tasty.
[SPEAKER_12]: The weed was a little bit moist.
[SPEAKER_12]: So once it gets that moisture out of it,
it might've clicked off on you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking at, they were getting some
coffee, salt spring coffee.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just in Salt Spring Islands.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you were at Salt Spring Islands?
[SPEAKER_09]: We landed at the airport there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ganges Harbor.
[SPEAKER_12]: Love Salt Spring Islands.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here, try this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me explain that one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see what you're doing here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see what you're doing with this
thing here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, that one tastes pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you're not getting rips off this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just got a huge rip off this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I actually got a goal for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: See what happened?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just stepping out of the light over
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's six inches out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't see me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had to like come over here for a
second.
[SPEAKER_09]: As the sun is moving, you can hear them.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're working on the train right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's pack these up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get on that mountain.
[SPEAKER_12]: Top gondola.
[SPEAKER_12]: And take these guys up.
[SPEAKER_12]: See you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gross Mountain.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit different coming
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd recommend that as soon as you get up
to the top, you make your way over to
[SPEAKER_00]: guest services and schedule an appointment
time to come down, because that'll save
[SPEAKER_00]: you from having to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this one runs a little bit slower
and it's smaller, it will mean that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are delays coming back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a rough idea of when you
want to come down, go to guest services as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true you're kind of really cloudy
like I say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been about this music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get one each.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to Lupin's.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean right there?
[SPEAKER_08]: What about Lupin's?
[SPEAKER_08]: Lupin's looks like they're organized right
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Water?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not real water.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Fasani.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what that shit is.
[SPEAKER_05]: People aren't
[SPEAKER_09]: renting things to ski right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, people can still go on the
helicopters, you'd think, no?
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we go check it out?
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it says closed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we can be right here sitting on the
stairs.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this is like a little zipline spot.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bench?
[SPEAKER_09]: And like that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got the tripod right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't we set up the drone?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do a quick little drone overhead.
[SPEAKER_11]: See what's up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: We are up on Grouse Mountain.
[SPEAKER_12]: You saw the beautiful ride up here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was showing the city as we went up.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're just kind of at the entrance
right next to the heli tours.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys saw that we were going to go do a
session there.
[SPEAKER_12]: We found this cool little bench right
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all plugged in.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got the battery pack going.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I figured let's just get this session
going, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Portable D-nail sitting on top of a
mountain while we're looking at Vancouver
[SPEAKER_09]: and the harbor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Epic scenery.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Victoria right over to the right
of me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Half Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're going to hit that Crown Royal.
[SPEAKER_12]: The CRD Jamaican Terps via Blue River.
[SPEAKER_09]: Via?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're Blue River Terps.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the ones that did the processing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just did it for our company.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come up with a way of getting these
amazing terpies that are just the flavors
[SPEAKER_09]: on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the first off.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty nice to be able to do rips like
this on the top of a mountain with the
[SPEAKER_12]: mothership and the D-nail and the silicon
carbide bowl.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really stoked on this Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm enjoying it and I'm still kind of
looking forward to the future of Puff
[SPEAKER_12]: Wednesday today.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got some good little zones that
we're going to go check out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get a little bit more drone flying in and
just sort of show you guys a little bit of
[SPEAKER_12]: where we are.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're quite above Vancouver right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's off in the distance.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's there and I'll show you once we
finish our dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, that's an amazing drop down.
[SPEAKER_09]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to Corey for that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: We really come to appreciate glass and the
work that's put into it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh man, it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got to give your shout out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Support your local glassblowers for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about Canadian art.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm Canadian, okay?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this one's American and Canadian.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a combination.
[SPEAKER_12]: North American.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got this carb cap right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jumping the gun a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to operate it hands free.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that your wallet on the ground?
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just threw it there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't need that on up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you ever get a chance when you're in
Vancouver and you jump on that gondola and
[SPEAKER_12]: you come up to the top of the mountain,
you get out, you walk to the right where
[SPEAKER_12]: the heli tours are, you walk to the left.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once you get to the heli tours and it's
just up a little path, you get right to
[SPEAKER_12]: this little spot.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can puff a bowl, overlook in the city
and we're going to show you what we're
[SPEAKER_12]: looking at right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: We just have to look up because the
drone's coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to show you what we're looking
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strictly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty sure this guy's harvesting
nuggets.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look in his bag here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like he's got bags of buds,
eh Johnny?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, look at this guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then he's got a little shovel.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he might be harvesting the
nuggets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that big wind turbine up there on
the mountain.
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright guys, so we just got here to the
sort of, not quite the top of Grouse
[SPEAKER_12]: Mountain where the windmill is.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're right below that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But this valley and Mount Baker in the
background.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if you guys can see that.
[SPEAKER_12]: If not, I'm going to zoom it right in so
you guys can see it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, I think immediately we should
show them drone footage of this valley.
[SPEAKER_12]: Quick little drone footage for you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to see this?
Enjoy.
Let's go.
Let's go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's a pretty spectacular view for
sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's us get the turps.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pulled out the kush cleaners for this
batch.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what did you have?
[SPEAKER_12]: You had a little can of tonic,
didn't you?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I had a little can of tonic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Should we do a little can of tonic kush
cleaner?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that sounds like a plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that sounds like as good as any
plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a tourist area.
[SPEAKER_09]: People come over and they see this epic
view.
[SPEAKER_09]: They see a couple guys chilling on a
camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: Laughing, just checking out the view.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, wow, what do they got
going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: BC.
[SPEAKER_09]: This beautiful BC.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're ever out and about and you see
us filming, by all means come on over.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so there's a kush cleaner,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at the bottom of that mountain.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually the United States of
America.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is the U.S.
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously Mount Baker is in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_12]: and that's what that is.
[SPEAKER_12]: So pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here you go, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_12]: My friend, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: The industrial tractors backing up in the
background.
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know what you're going to find
on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just happy to be enjoying these
beautiful fall colors on the side of the
[SPEAKER_06]: mountain.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't really see it because you guys
are looking just at the trees over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But on this side, which I'll show you
after this, it is pretty sweet looking.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that kush cleaner?
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good combination.
[SPEAKER_06]: I figured it would be pretty good
combination, you know, with that
[SPEAKER_06]: cherry-esque, the canatonic often.
[SPEAKER_07]: This place is hopping all over us right
now, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just put it away for you,
you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Other people enjoying the view,
of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's a hard view not to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be nice to parasail right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just to jump on the sail and fly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Join that drone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to dip.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to dip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Into some kush cleaner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing, Nick.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did a crown run.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was all about getting you a hit of
the kush cleaner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Carb cap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Carb cap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I haven't been here for like 20 some
odd years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, really nice to come back and see how
we have the old gun bowlers that used to
[SPEAKER_09]: be here.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're gone now.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's turned into a road down here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they only have a couple of ski
hills down there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean here in Grouse?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they do a bunch of other things,
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like snowshoeing and other winter
activities for the kids.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just epic outdoor adventures here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely the most popular thing here is
the grind.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people do it every year,
and some people do it incredibly fast,
[SPEAKER_12]: and some people do it incredibly slow,
and pretty much everything in between.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you ever want to challenge
yourself, it's kind of a little bucket
[SPEAKER_12]: list sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rock the Grouse grind.
[SPEAKER_12]: Run up or hike up or walk up, whatever
you're capable of.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then take the gondola down after a
nice lunch.
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe a turp dip, bong rip,
fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is, you know, that's Darren,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: D420K.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, bong rip, turp dip,
fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Johnny and I are going to continue
on the journey here to find some more
[SPEAKER_12]: wonderful spots to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a dab in each spot is enough on Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a day to relax.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get to our next spot.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's find the next spot.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: My life, it's my life, it's my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's your life, it's your life,
it's your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we come together for one life,
we're coming from behind, behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spiritual warriors are on a mission,
showing the world our watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spiritual warriors trotting from behind,
trotting forward.
So
[SPEAKER_01]: let's turn, let's turn the tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I and I come to turn the tables.
Turn the paradigm around.
Yes, deprogram and reprogram, free
mankind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right here, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_10]: Line up for the thing, I believe is right
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are lined up for the gondola,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone hold.
It's OK.
It's OK.
It's OK.
