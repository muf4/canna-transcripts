[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world I
am over with Nate a buddy that I just met
[SPEAKER_03]: really online in the last month or so So
kind of a funny story how Nate and I met
[SPEAKER_03]: he purchased some blue river terpenes from
me And he was having some credit card
[SPEAKER_03]: nightmares and so he ended up just being
like I'm canceling that one And I guess he
[SPEAKER_03]: forgot that he had done this order with me
and so it came back and also when he did
[SPEAKER_03]: the order there was also a little bit of
it was a different address and a different
[SPEAKER_03]: shipping address with a different country
in fact and It was kind of funny,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I was a little worried that it
was a scam and I contacted him and he
[SPEAKER_03]: assured me No, dude, trust me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good But things kept taking a
little bit longer like a week and I
[SPEAKER_03]: started getting more nervous It was a
little bit aggressive and he was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh brah, I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry and then like a week later
he's like hey do you want to come over and
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit this pipe that I just purchased which
was is even a stranger Trippier story
[SPEAKER_03]: because of course if you guys are
recognizing this piece right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: this was a beautiful mothership that High
integrity glass art sold jeez.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be over a year ago now Yeah,
gentlemen from Montreal out East had
[SPEAKER_03]: purchased it and he actually came to my
hotel room on a few occasions and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: lucky enough to smoke out of it while he
had it and Now, you know now Nate's got it
[SPEAKER_03]: and he invited me over so I thought well
let's go film a fun video over at Nate's
[SPEAKER_03]: place in Vancouver and I Brought the rosin
that we pressed out the other day with Dom
[SPEAKER_03]: and Max, which you also know Yeah,
so it's a small world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nate also is friends with Dom and Max.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got some Blue River terpenes
We've got some beautiful flavors here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically two flavors pressed at different
temperatures at different times I brought
[SPEAKER_03]: the Teflon and The 09 cookies so got a
couple of Teflons couple of 09 cookies and
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah a few You want to fire up the beast
and take the opening dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get you one off here Let's open up a
turp I'm saying cookies Interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: because when I did meet up with the
gentleman that had purchased this pipe
[SPEAKER_03]: from Rowe It was the cookies that he
bought from me like in multiple packs that
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Here we are Just a delicate little turp
dip there Nice bounce and catch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's a basketball action right there
finesse finesse in that shit Alright,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'll just ask for the carb cap of
choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much Nice with the seed of
life for the single So ridiculous when I
[SPEAKER_03]: got it that one that had a slit in it
still oh wow Wow, so you just grabbed
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself a mega pot
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to tell us a little bit about
this pipe you must have learned all the
[SPEAKER_04]: fancy names and everything about it by now
I heard 3d purple rain exosphere and
[SPEAKER_04]: that's about it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that's different than I heard is
that second little exosphere kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: inside of it Sick though it hits so well
when you hold it in your hands like that
[SPEAKER_04]: You can feel the rumble or crazy compared
to if it's just on the surface even Agreed
[SPEAKER_03]: A little q-tip action sure What a
beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a wonderful rumble.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's um It's actually one of the reasons
why this particular piece a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: really heady pieces I won't pick up I'll
leave it there and I'll hit it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with a piece like this You really want
to feel it rumbling in your hand and
[SPEAKER_03]: rumble it does I was a perfect low temp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's get you one of those because
it was just so darn nice It wasn't a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: dab by any means.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually take Slightly smaller dabs when
I'm turf dipping for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure I also find that it really
potentiates it so much
[SPEAKER_03]: That was number nine Well, I'm about to go
into my little phone here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to go to the picture I'll tell you
while you're taking your dab what the
[SPEAKER_03]: difference is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So number nine Number nine is a second
press.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 0.6 of a gram that came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Teflon And it was the second
press.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah Delicious I dipped it in cookies
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not going to be an accurate
feedback of these the cultivar itself,
[SPEAKER_03]: but Stoked to be hitting this 3d
Mothership Try to get some nice camera up
[SPEAKER_03]: close for you guys to see the actual
Bubbling that occurs here in the rumbling
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say Can't believe the perfect
perfect Tempt that you give me every time
[SPEAKER_03]: on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer personally a larger banger or XL
honeypot Like I just for sure even for
[SPEAKER_03]: small dabs even Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about that surface area,
especially the way quartz dissipates its
[SPEAKER_04]: heat Someone was asking me if the etchings
like in the actual bucket like for the
[SPEAKER_04]: seat of life if that increases the surface
area naturally makes a difference I have
[SPEAKER_04]: no idea if it does or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll definitely tell you that when I
put the sherbert pencil in And just moved
[SPEAKER_03]: it around gently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm right away notice those Okay,
so I'll be a little more gentle maybe just
[SPEAKER_03]: hold this here Yeah, yeah, of course that
makes total sense actually Especially with
[SPEAKER_03]: ridges like that with a titanium one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I generally will put it in a quartz and
just do this I just hold it up against the
[SPEAKER_04]: wall I'll tell you I'll tell you I think
we should hit another one just because a
[SPEAKER_03]: this piece is amazing B.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just kind of meeting each other and
having our first sesh and well,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's all sorts of other flavors here So
what was number one that I did was it this
[SPEAKER_03]: one was the first one we just popped,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of want to go on this real super
butter
[SPEAKER_04]: Which two did you order when you ordered I
got the crown royal Jamaican one and
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful Beautiful Excited to hit this
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Always look at a pipe like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably noticed right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took my keys off I'm really one of the
first people even though it's not my pipe
[SPEAKER_03]: But because I photograph them often and
make videos with them and stuff I feel
[SPEAKER_03]: still an extreme responsibility of being
around them that I have no problem sharing
[SPEAKER_03]: that information with people Even like
sunglasses on here that can fall off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just just right here we go The
[SPEAKER_04]: carb cap is so deep in the crown It's like
a full knuckle in it's pretty cool though
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my favorite OFC Wow Beautiful low
temp dab on that and did you notice the
[SPEAKER_03]: lighter color rosin made a clearly lighter
color oil in the dish as well And if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: 50-50 Absolutely Well, what a pure joy I
had no idea today I was going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: Hanging out with a new friend be smoking
out of an elite mothership and see Making
[SPEAKER_03]: a video for all of you guys to enjoy I've
been pumping out videos lately like the
[SPEAKER_03]: last four or five have been real
consistent and and good but Today I had no
[SPEAKER_03]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, ah, we'll take a day off
No days off for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No rest you will smoke elites Sure has
changed the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I really have Have taken this
whole thing to a new level which it helps
[SPEAKER_03]: other glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure because It takes collecting to
the next level when you have a piece like
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's you know literally five to six
figures, it's It's a special piece of art.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not It no longer It's just a thing
how an actual piece of Functional art I
[SPEAKER_03]: think of all these people that spend
millions of dollars on art to use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get to use the art I mean sure
it's hanging up on your wall and it looks
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful But this you can pull it down
Take some dabs out of it Get completely
[SPEAKER_03]: lit And then yeah, put it right back up
There was a nice dab you got there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a really nice one and that was
turd free Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't turd free.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just free of added excess added
turps So what do we think in here now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe number eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty like tacky Yeah,
well that's I knew we weren't gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to rewrite it all I know these
stickier ones that are less.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's still pretty buttery But the
more tackier ones are second runs second
[SPEAKER_03]: presses and still completely delicious So,
let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: What number was that number eight?
[SPEAKER_03]: So number eight You are a second press of
the Teflon looks super nice and golden
[SPEAKER_03]: there for the crappy picture that it is
It's like golden tears All right,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I guess we got to heat this bad boy up
Take it you're doing so good on the torch
[SPEAKER_03]: This timer I like your timer I want to
grab that what is it now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Interval timer who'd have guessed Well
after this dab is this my third and have
[SPEAKER_03]: you had two or three?
[SPEAKER_03]: Two so okay So after not this dab at the
next dab that Nate is about to take
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps we will find ourselves out in the
city at a beach or at a park or in nature
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of wanted to get out start the
show here and then take the piece
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere really beautiful and get a
couple of nice Nature shots also brought
[SPEAKER_03]: the drone so I could potentially happen as
well Anyway, I'm getting ready in the 10
[SPEAKER_03]: second range here 10 second range Also a
good pipe not to be grabbing if you have
[SPEAKER_03]: rings around your fingers, you know
grabbing with the rings That's a sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: faux pas in my mind
[SPEAKER_03]: God it's just so It's such a lovely
experience To ride in the Bentley,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that's really the truth of it
right there So well, it's such a pipe that
[SPEAKER_03]: is worthwhile of producing in elite form
in my opinion You know, I've hit a few
[SPEAKER_03]: head pieces over the years That hit like
utter and complete shit, which is just
[SPEAKER_03]: like almost a crime I remember really
meeting with Jason Lee and him talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about how you know, he just wouldn't sell
a pipe like that He would always put water
[SPEAKER_03]: And he always trouble trouble it,
you know feel that it was hitting the way
[SPEAKER_03]: you at least were you know felt like was a
good representation of your work,
[SPEAKER_03]: but You know with these ships.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one thing that is pretty
consistent that They hit great Have you
[SPEAKER_04]: ever hit the one that's the I?
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know exactly what it would be but I
guess kind of a tourist Then it has a 3d
[SPEAKER_04]: axis here in it and it doesn't have like
any climb parts at all
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting I Don't think I've hit it
before Oh, no, I've never even seen that
[SPEAKER_03]: thing before that's tripped out We'll show
that to you I'll insert it into the video
[SPEAKER_03]: so you guys can see We're looking at right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one is you After a torch up yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: yes Those turps drip downward So yeah,
we should get out I don't know where but
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere it would be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the drone It would be cool to
get that thing in action as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely limited to our time right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 248 and it gets dark out like fast So
try to get some fat footage for you if it
[SPEAKER_03]: works out it works out if not Hey,
we had a great session out of an elite
[SPEAKER_03]: mothership piece Yeah, that's another
thing it's been rainy for about 60 days
[SPEAKER_03]: here so getting a little bit of Sun is
kind of a big deal This is another reason
[SPEAKER_03]: I suggest you learn how to ski or
snowboard and like the mountain because if
[SPEAKER_03]: it rains the way it's probably going to
this Winter there'll be a ton of snow and
[SPEAKER_03]: the snow Is super fun and it's like a good
vibe and the rain is kind of a bummer and
[SPEAKER_03]: not a good vibe I mean it is with people
who don't mind it but the people man if
[SPEAKER_03]: you have a problem with rain and you move
to like Washington State or the west coast
[SPEAKER_03]: of British Columbia Don't do it because it
rains here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a temperate rainforest need a
lot of water Comes in pretty consistent
[SPEAKER_03]: nice rip Cooks all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we are going to Put this thing in
its case and head out into the city of
[SPEAKER_03]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who knows where we'll see you next But
it's going to be in about a split second
[SPEAKER_03]: Transition and there we will be All right,
so Nate and I have made it down to what is
[SPEAKER_03]: this English Bay It is English Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just kind of at the far end of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, there's the boathouse over there
That's all sort of Denman Street and
[SPEAKER_03]: Vancouver part of Vancouver in the
background And then of course the
[SPEAKER_03]: endowment lands are behind us and we're
right here on the Pacific Ocean and I
[SPEAKER_03]: guess we brought the beautiful piece we
took some lovely photos on the side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Sand and on the rocks and as you can see
because you're looking at them right now
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't they lovely?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I managed to grab some q-tips to
maintain the integrity integrity of that
[SPEAKER_03]: Excel banner And I guess really it's a
matter of passing me over that dabber I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: let you do the torching.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hold the OXE if you like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't have to worry about such things Got
an extra hand It's one of those things
[SPEAKER_03]: when you say you're gonna hold that you
don't put down you actually hold Alright
[SPEAKER_03]: so we're only gonna do a dab each here as
we've been very graciously Awarded a free
[SPEAKER_03]: music zone by our neighbors who are
enjoying their music But I told them I
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't able to record if music was on so
they were pretty cool Vancouver dudes just
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered to turn it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do thank them
[SPEAKER_03]: Nature dabs the mothership elite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the sound of the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go,
[SPEAKER_03]: sir Because that's what friends are for
coming out into nature so yeah the sun's
[SPEAKER_03]: going down as you can see It's kind of
behind us here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really see but it's not too far
from going down We might get to one other
[SPEAKER_03]: spot after this if we can rip into Stanley
Park real quick and pull over On another
[SPEAKER_03]: little zone and have another little
session.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to at least get three zones
for you guys With this beautiful piece and
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, it's just such a joy to shoot
the thing every time both photography wise
[SPEAKER_03]: My goodness 8 seconds this timer is the
timer for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely the timer
[SPEAKER_03]: 8 seconds in and it is his time for the
dab
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cold actually which is Insane because
it seems like it's much warmer out now
[SPEAKER_03]: when we first got out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like it was cool But now I could
sit here until the sun sets for sure All
[SPEAKER_03]: right, pass me that little sherbert pencil
We're a big one whatever Got to do it all
[SPEAKER_03]: those are the rules, you know So yeah,
just a beautiful day people walking down
[SPEAKER_03]: the path here all different walks of life
enjoying life here in Vancouver You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the beautiful thing about Vancouver is it
really is a multicultural city people from
[SPEAKER_03]: all over the place come and live here And
it's I mean you yourself came from the u
[SPEAKER_03]: .s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool Watch it up So yeah with for
those of you that aren't aware of English
[SPEAKER_03]: Bay We're basically right at the entrance
to Stanley Park one of the you know It's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of our version of Central Park here
in in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as large as the city of Downtown
Vancouver, so it's it's a big chunk and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's definitely a bonus to have it to be
able to go walk through like the bike
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty killer I love this piece
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is yeah we are
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful so we scored a couple of nature
dabs at the beach We're not gonna waste
[SPEAKER_03]: any more time I'm gonna cut to the next
scene so these gentlemen next door to us
[SPEAKER_03]: can Listen to the music and yeah,
let's head deeper into the park
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just doing his thing all right little
session on the side of the Guys I Think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder like what what do you even see
when you look at that?
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't know what it is like what I
want to interview that guy right now Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: but did she even know what it was Was she
like that's a piper no That's what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really look like All right all
right
[SPEAKER_03]: Well we're here right on the side of the
lake that is literally Right next to the
[SPEAKER_03]: entrance to Stanley Park through the city
So there's Stanley Park through the sorry
[SPEAKER_03]: Vancouver Buildings through the trees
there All right, we wanted to record with
[SPEAKER_03]: the beautiful sunset You know,
but we'd rather just sit here,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think have a nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the view and we'll show you the
view Afterwards so that'll work out fine,
[SPEAKER_03]: so all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna hit this bad boy up Where they
can see some of it because it's too nice
[SPEAKER_03]: not to share
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how you have to hold this piece
Yeah, and it's good if you have angels
[SPEAKER_03]: singing in the background How we doing for
the timer ten seconds yes
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you could maybe that's a product for
elites only all right
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so tasty I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you there sure is like more attention
paid to hitting on these elites really pay
[SPEAKER_03]: attention in every aspect of what you're
doing you just My pocket so they would be
[SPEAKER_03]: nice and quick for access Maybe do some
camera work for this particular dab
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're missing it over here
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 seconds left on the timer just enough
time to give you guys a beautiful pan out
[SPEAKER_03]: of that lovely Sun setting Yep,
I'm Stanley Park for the win Glad we
[SPEAKER_03]: managed to hit three spots Nate good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy your dad brother
[SPEAKER_03]: Booyah Well, I don't know how it could get
any better than that three fat spots and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy I had a good day Nate's coffin
in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that was a good rep I guess Thank
Nate for coming through with the super
[SPEAKER_03]: piece found it out brother and Yeah,
thank you guys for watching bubble man's
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
