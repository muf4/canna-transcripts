[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to Bowman's World!
[SPEAKER_11]: We are in Barcelona with Jibs and John and
me and Sublime on the bows.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess it's wake and bake,
huh boys?
[SPEAKER_11]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been wake and baking it for a while,
kind of just sitting here for about an
[SPEAKER_11]: hour, puffing and chatting, and then I
realized, why haven't we been filming
[SPEAKER_11]: this?
[SPEAKER_11]: Tony's still asleep.
[SPEAKER_11]: He went pretty hard, I think for like 48
plus hours or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that when you guys went?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about like 36 hours to two days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Took us a while to get over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Neither of us really slept much the night
before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Too exciting, eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're here now in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's morning time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me the flow.
[SPEAKER_08]: See I had the patch on last night that
Tony gave me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah yes, which one?
[SPEAKER_08]: CBD?
[SPEAKER_08]: CBN?
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a CBD patch last night.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are really cool, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to put on a patch today.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_11]: I felt so relaxed last night.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel really good after 12 hours of being
on a plane.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've been puffing nothing but the full
melt since we got here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We hit watermelon, we hit that crazy
Spanish bubble yesterday.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know what was that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That wasn't Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have to find out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don and Aaron have it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was definitely top notch
ridiculousness.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to seeing them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, dude, they're looking forward to
seeing you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're definitely looking forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the last time we went through the
Chem Dog Cross.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the Chem Dog Mendo Cross.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I might hit some of this Grand
Starkiller.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is soapy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's no more of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell it was last night.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I only went through it quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this was definitely, well,
it was enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good work, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: So day one of the Spandex today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, look forward to seeing what the
event is like.
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing all the people, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing all the people, seeing all the
friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great folks in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plane riding was full of a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh gosh, our plane was... We had Simon
from Serious Seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don and Aaron were literally sitting right
across the aisle next to us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Serious lineup.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we had Jason was there from Damp
Cring.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was even a couple other people that
I recognized but didn't know their names,
[SPEAKER_11]: but they're definitely in the scene and
work in the scene.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if that plane went down,
we were laughing and wouldn't be enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, take out a big chunk of the canvas
community.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like one plane.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, it's that last two o'clock
flight into Barcelona the day before the
[SPEAKER_11]: event, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You figure out most of the people from
Holland.
[SPEAKER_11]: We flew in from Amsterdam, obviously.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys might have seen us puffing on the
rooftop patio there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we were talking about leaving back
here, he's like, we should make a bet that
[SPEAKER_08]: we're going to see all the plane from
Amsterdam to Barcelona because you know
[SPEAKER_08]: we're going to see some people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, I turned around and was
like, hey, hey, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_08]: And we first walked down into the place.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was like no one there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're the first ones there.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be somebody.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's running back and forth.
[SPEAKER_08]: He goes, don't they have a change?
[SPEAKER_08]: They always change it at the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're like, people started talking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Slowly, people started acquiring.
[SPEAKER_08]: And sure enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_11]: 90 Micron.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_11]: Always.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it forever.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very clean.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, we got a good day ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do some filming with this
documentary.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice thing that we're doing with Tony.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go do some interviews down at Spanapis and
check out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight there's a party at La Verde.
[SPEAKER_11]: Club Verde.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a party tonight.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll be down there doing a bit of
filming and puffing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we got our friend Amir is on the
way right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: He just came in from Turkey.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's on his way here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Luis from Cannabis Culture is on his way
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's down in that room.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to continue on puffing
bowls and maybe Tony will wake up a little
[SPEAKER_11]: later on and we'll hear what he has to say
for our first morning waking up in Spain.
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, we're going to one wake up and do
a huge session.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to wake up and be like,
yeah, we're coming out of the session.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already been talking about this for
two hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: We filmed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can watch it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be like, check this out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at the light.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want you to look at the light.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was so excited just today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was excited for him.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the way he geeks out on the quality
and settings, the shot up and the sound
[SPEAKER_11]: quality and the video quality.
[SPEAKER_11]: He takes things serious.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got extreme attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure he will be recharged.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what he used to do that
strain, Astro Boy, but I've looked it up a
[SPEAKER_11]: million times and it's funny that I just
forget it each time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a TGA strain.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it was a bad boy.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was doing some breathing first.
[SPEAKER_11]: The watermelon was an accident.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Astro Boy was an accident.
[SPEAKER_07]: Accidents happen sometimes are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I tell people all the time to
play around and make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be like, what's the best way to do
this?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the best way to do that?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, look, I'm just here to give you
generalizations.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not like the guy telling you how to
set up your lab and that you have to do it
[SPEAKER_11]: this way or that way.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm more like trying to show everyone in
general how to do it and from there,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is something I just recently posted
in that drying hash group, which was like,
[SPEAKER_11]: get the basic foundation and then if you
have people that you are inspired by their
[SPEAKER_11]: hash or how it looks and they live in your
geographic region, ask them some
[SPEAKER_11]: questions.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's no point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drying techniques will definitely vary
from where you are.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone like Brittany telling someone,
oh, there's moisture in that hash or
[SPEAKER_11]: there's no moisture in that hash,
or telling people to jar it up after 16
[SPEAKER_11]: hours of being microplained, fine for the
desert, maybe not so fine for a good
[SPEAKER_11]: night's sleep, or it's very humid.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean a thick desiccant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our moisture levels are so high in the air
that parchment paper is not thick enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, the first time I used cardboard
and it was thin, it wasn't thick enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not even close.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your relative humidity out there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say higher.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: 60's a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a room and it's 20 to 30% humidity.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we're just trying to get.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it will get down to 8.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can get a room down to 20,
if it gets to 18% humidity, it tries
[SPEAKER_07]: really quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, you guys ready for this?
[SPEAKER_11]: This strain was an unplanned pregnancy,
the astro-boy watermelon.
[SPEAKER_11]: While making one Danny boy seeds,
bad boy was working with live pollen for
[SPEAKER_11]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_11]: He got major drift and a few Apollo 13
females seeded.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we know the taco male and what he
did to females.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had already grown our Danny boy and
simply loved what he added to the killer
[SPEAKER_11]: queen.
[SPEAKER_11]: The shock was when grow results started
coming in with growers tossing out
[SPEAKER_11]: collected strains and replacing with this
little bit of dankness.
[SPEAKER_11]: What we look at is a cherry tart Apollo 13
and a damn serious sativa hybrid.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some decent heart racing visuals.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was about to say, definitely a nice
sativa.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so it's Apollo 13, crossed with
Ortega, crossed with C99.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then he's got Ortega, crossed with
C99.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ortega, U.S., California and an indica.
[SPEAKER_11]: C99, princess crossed with Cinderella,
88.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just goes right down.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Apollo 13 is genius crossed with the
P75.
[SPEAKER_11]: The genius is with Jack Herrera,
which is the haze times northern lights,
[SPEAKER_11]: five times Shiva skunk.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just, and it goes for a whole,
like dude, that to me is impressive.
[SPEAKER_11]: The family tree of genetics and the
explanation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're trying to, yeah,
they're trying to take it all the way to
[SPEAKER_07]: Afghani, Aboriginal Mexico.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And land race strains, which is
impressive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job, Sub.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right down to the bottom, princess.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the P75.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never, P75, that sounds like some,
didn't Ed Rosenfeld used to have strains
[SPEAKER_11]: back in the day, like 20 years ago that
were all like J12.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should ask him this week.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should be free on Monday.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't see Ed at all the events.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was surprised to see him in the airport
yesterday.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I look forward to meeting him.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can talk to him in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he was, we laughed and then,
uh, the health expo in Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_08]: he's like, came back.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, yeah, like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just kind of took it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, oh, yeah, I opened it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause everybody just offers some weeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it opened up the jar to see if you're
having a smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just like, Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And grab a handful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just like, I guess, I guess that's
how it goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Help yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Came back, signed a book, had a little
chat, you know, all my friends were coming
[SPEAKER_11]: up to me, dude, look, Ed Rosenthal signed
my book.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a book signed by Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, check out page four.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, go to page four,
acknowledgements.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's like a whole page of people,
but I'm like right in there and like the
[SPEAKER_11]: ninth name or something, Bowman.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, dude, I'm in your book.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in the acknowledgements.
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically because I have paid for ads with
Ed.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I got acknowledged.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always, uh, advertised in a big book
of buds and we've always done well with,
[SPEAKER_11]: with Ed's projects.
[SPEAKER_11]: He has good distribution.
[SPEAKER_11]: People like his stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's quality.
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be our door.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could be a mirror.
[SPEAKER_11]: See who it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be Louise.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Translator.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh oh.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might actually be equipped.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that at the door door?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we buzz them in?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Amir's on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Amir's from Turkey.
[SPEAKER_11]: Amir owned, um, a restaurant across from
my gallery, the melting point.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a gallery back in 2002, three and
four, three, four and five.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's where Marbleslinger and I did the
degenerate art.
[SPEAKER_11]: Show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: The original one before the documentary,
which was just a huge glass show.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a beautiful gallery.
[SPEAKER_11]: Had a raw food cafe, super high integrity.
[SPEAKER_11]: Had a vapor bar like 10, 12, 13 years
before, before it ended up happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, it's just, it was too bad that it
was ahead of its time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And basically I ended up closing it down
after my father passed away.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was kind of a quick, shocking
experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like when he passed away, it was shocking.
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't like he was sick or anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: So once that happened, it was kind of
like, ah, I don't know if I have the
energy.
Hey, I love this.
How are you?
Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, John, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is Jibs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice meeting you.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have some beautiful past.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing a little filming, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have one.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just filming bubble mounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to rip a bubble as you're
joining the table?
[SPEAKER_11]: How have you been?
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to hear.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's Turkey treating you?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of chaotic at the moment.
Really?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's weird when shit gets chaotic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, 45.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuel-y.
[SPEAKER_11]: My 45's got turps.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a champ.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're always very turkey-y.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Always.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can pick the 45 up with my nose.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even care how many hatches there
are on the table.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't pick it up with my nose because of
it all.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care about the strength.
[SPEAKER_11]: It all has a 45 smell.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a certain observing profile that
always hits me off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I don't even know how to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a concentrate of oils.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's why it always, always lights on fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never seen the 45 not light just the
way it does.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just lavas out and just... Yeah,
lavas out and just like... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a fan.
[SPEAKER_11]: How was that?
Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how long are you here for?
[SPEAKER_11]: Until Monday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the majority of people are here
until about Monday.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be here until well after
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we'll be able to think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once we go to that span visit,
it's going to take a long... It's not
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be... It's going to be so busy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so big and grandiose that it won't
be... I don't know how big events get
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was really surprised to hear that
they have a whole operating two to three
[SPEAKER_07]: hundred social clubs here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really impressive statistic even
from Colorado where cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Barcelona definitely has a huge club scene
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Three hundred cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Three hundred?
[SPEAKER_11]: And what's the population of the city?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's find that out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a beautiful city.
[SPEAKER_08]: Three hundred.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen them behind just a week.
[SPEAKER_08]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's like going pop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you remember some members can only
invite other members was the scenario,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's not.
[SPEAKER_11]: One point six million as of 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: Capital of the city is autonomous capital.
[SPEAKER_11]: The second largest city in the country
with a population of one point six
[SPEAKER_11]: million.
[SPEAKER_07]: And probably getting like ten million
tourists a year or so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Madrid's got three point two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Paris is in the middle with two point two.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here I thought it was just a little
old one point six million people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's a fair chunk of people for
sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's a fair chunk of people.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think we're filming late.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to continue to pop and catch
you guys later.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, we're filming.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're live.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're live and direct here at the
Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's Pinsky.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking for Pinsky.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pinsky's right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pinsky.
[SPEAKER_11]: We found him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally made it here.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's tough to travel in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to get motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we've got to get motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to get on them.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So here we are at Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming in hot.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's Giddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a serious line right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess we're walking in the door
here at Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty nice clothing that hosted it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's not too shabby, this beautiful
entrance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Made of a pyramid.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you got to admit that entrance
back there, what we would call the lobby,
[SPEAKER_11]: was as big as some cannabis festivals.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I would say.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of booths, a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_11]: We almost want to look at a map because
we're going to be walking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, the greenhouse has got the
monitors that they have.
[SPEAKER_11]: DNA, paradise.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's Luke.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's Sweet C.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I'm just going to see Don there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Jaime?
[SPEAKER_11]: We hit it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gone, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, Bubble Band TV?
[SPEAKER_11]: Stoked to be here.
[SPEAKER_11]: The River Rock TV.
[SPEAKER_11]: All, and all of the above.
[SPEAKER_11]: DNA TV.
[SPEAKER_11]: And DNA TV.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly it, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at the fucking cops.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well-represented boys.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: What
[SPEAKER_05]: about you, Aaron?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you eating any good seafood while
you've been here, man?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, we've got friends over
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: They took me out to one of my favorite
seafood restaurants last night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had a great lobster, shellfish.
[SPEAKER_05]: We always have.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, guys, here at Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just bumped into Enrico from
Sublimator.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bubble Man, Bubble Man, what's up,
man?
[SPEAKER_11]: So happy to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see you at Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, this is your first as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: My first, and I'm a little overwhelmed by
the size of this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just wow, wow, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, give me goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's an enormous amount of people
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tons of booths.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good quality booths as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's check out your booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you get a good?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that smells nice in the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a lavender oil that I... It's
not lavender.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an OG perp, but it smells like
lavender.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't do that stuff, I know,
bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it's nice to see for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for sharing, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony!
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scals in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot caliente.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caliente!
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot caliente is both ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: Caliente.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hot caliente.
[SPEAKER_11]: Monster dab for Tony.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tony, are you going to do that?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a half gram, you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just okay, it's just a half gram.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, she's just dabbing from the side.
[SPEAKER_11]: Slab dabbing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Slab and dabbing.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, Al?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on, brother?
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: You as well?
[SPEAKER_11]: Having fun in Spain?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, dude, absolutely stoked.
[SPEAKER_11]: They wanted this cannabis and just kind of
walking around, bumping into familiars.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a pretty epic first date.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know, it's good.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so many people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm taking it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually quite ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gypsies in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, we're going to continue
on here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for checking us out, Enrico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, bubble men.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble men's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to take that again, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Take two.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know Tony can't wait longer than like
a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: Take two.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a second here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a nice bubble wrap.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's killer.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's bubbling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Gyps made that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gyps made that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's killer.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's bubbling.
[SPEAKER_12]: Gyps made it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Gyps made it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even realize it came.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finger on the hole mark if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a choke on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tilt it if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: One,
[SPEAKER_03]: two, three.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to wear bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's proper.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sublimating.
[SPEAKER_11]: Little River Rock bubble hash made by
Gyps.
[SPEAKER_11]: Enrico brought us the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just ripped it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's super delicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Alex.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Alex just stopped me here in the Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's local.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's showing us some dry sift from
Morocco.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Double zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's the zero zero that it's... Can
you focus it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It should focus on its own.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really... Well, if you want to take
it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's really, you know... There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Undersmelled.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could smell it with... Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take a little smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to... So it's always nice in
hash culture when we can recognize someone
[SPEAKER_11]: that you appreciate their work in one
capacity or the other.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you appreciate the photos.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really appreciate the photos.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad you love it all.
[SPEAKER_11]: And here, check this one out.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what I got.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is from Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?
[SPEAKER_11]: With my friend Ron.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is part of the hash culture in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_11]: He recognized me, came up, said he liked
the videos, recognized scouts.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, appreciated our videos and then
showed us some nice hash dry sifted from
[SPEAKER_11]: Morocco.
[SPEAKER_11]: What did this make?
[SPEAKER_11]: This was with Astro Boy, the watermelon
phenome.
[SPEAKER_11]: So TGA strain Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninety micron.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ninety.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ninety micron.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great spice to it, though.
[SPEAKER_11]: Almost reminiscent of an old school hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: With the new school formal... Do you want
to smell?
[SPEAKER_04]: The old watermelon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the old watermelon, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we have a lot of bubble hash from
other countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the best tea I ever tried.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's got the lid?
[SPEAKER_11]: Me or you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have the lid or you have the lid?
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, it's just nice to get together
with people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if we can't be puffing, it's at least
nice to share the smell of your hash with
[SPEAKER_11]: someone that you know appreciates it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just setting up with Scott and Tony here
for River Rock TV.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're about to do a little clip right
out in front of the entrance.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just sort of in the lobby,
outdoor entrance area of Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it really is quite a large event.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard 50, 60,000 people attend this
event and I've heard more than one person
[SPEAKER_11]: who works in the industry, lives in Europe
and goes to all the shows say this is the
[SPEAKER_11]: premier cannabis show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically in Europe right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll keep giving you little clips here
and there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, what up?
[SPEAKER_11]: Bubble Man here with Remo, the urban
grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had no idea you were going to be here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just came in for the last moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to make it back on time
for the court case in Canada?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, only here for four days.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice, and of course here is Spanavis 2014
in Barcelona, or as most people here
[SPEAKER_11]: pronounce it, Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can Google that and find out why.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a cane many years ago who
apparently had a lisp and no one wanted to
[SPEAKER_11]: make him feel uncomfortable because he
might cut your head off.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so everyone just said Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you'll see many people say Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not making fun of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't cut my head off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen any nice nuggets since
you've been here?
A ton.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you've seen some nice things?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Real amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen some crazy extra acts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen some beautiful herb DNA hats.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen a really nice kosher kush tangy
cross that looks just like kosher kush but
[SPEAKER_11]: stunk like goo on the watches.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they had some gifted strains from
the South of Spain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right when we met up with them they got
the box right there and they opened it
[SPEAKER_11]: with this really beautiful red bubble from
a friend down in the South of Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That bubble was dabbed in and it just
turned into red and disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your plan for the urban grower
here in the four days?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to cruise around, film some
shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're taking videos, we're taking
pictures, we're meeting people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, are you introducing
the gel?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk a little bit about your
gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've just been approved to Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, and that's for rooting?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a rooting program.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to get rooting gel from
Cologne.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have two guys here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never heard Matt basically a rooting
guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a rooting gel company owner who grows
his tang and the herb is used.
[SPEAKER_12]: We worked out it would be thicker and
thinner.
[SPEAKER_12]: We changed different amounts.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good bumping into you,
Remo.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll film again for your show probably
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll make a video.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll make a video and we'll see you guys
later at Spanavis 2014.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you.
Well,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's medical seats.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can go left or right.
[SPEAKER_11]: All
[SPEAKER_11]: right, here's an interesting little point
of view.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're with the CBD crew here and Matt,
the great gardener, is just in the
[SPEAKER_11]: background talking to a good friend of
mine, Robbie, who's been at many of the
[SPEAKER_11]: Legends of Hash parties.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are about to be shown the canatonic
dry sift that the great gardener grew and
[SPEAKER_11]: I cleaned.
[SPEAKER_11]: And man, did that shit grease up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, mind to god.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it with your smile in the
background too.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
