[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I think we're going live here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me a few more seconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I stayed up late.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just waking up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okey dokey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we are live on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am just going to quickly copy and paste
the link over into the old chat room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm going to let everyone into
the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, everyone was ready this morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, first of all, thank you,
everyone, for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a special episode of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're celebrating the life of Frenchy
Kanoli.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really goes without saying,
introducing Frenchy, a hashish aficionado
[SPEAKER_08]: of the greatest level.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please mute your mic if you don't mind
real quickly there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just going to introduce Madame Kanoli
Kimberly, who were she's going to be sort
[SPEAKER_08]: of our pseudo my secondary host today
because this is really she reached out to
[SPEAKER_08]: me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I met her at Lyft not too long ago where I
got to see Frenchy dreams of hashish this
[SPEAKER_08]: documentary dash movie.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had tears in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It inspired me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really loved it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought what better place to join
and speak about it than here on Hash
[SPEAKER_08]: Church, something we haven't done for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of you guys have been on Hash Church
before some of you haven't.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to pass it over to Madame
Kanoli.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now she can introduce everyone and we can
talk about what we're going to be speaking
[SPEAKER_08]: about today.
[SPEAKER_08]: So boom, Shankara, Shankara Maha Dayev.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get this party started.
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't get to talk after the film.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was very touched that you came to see it
when it was screened in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe, you know, it's really hard for me
to see everybody here in a kind of
[SPEAKER_22]: efficient way.
[SPEAKER_22]: But let me just go across the top and
Bill, you're next in line.
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe you can introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys hear me OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's good to see you, Kim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Cherry Blossom Bell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Frenchy Kanoli's formal apprentice,
and I lived and worked with him and Madame
[SPEAKER_03]: Kanoli and traveled with them for over
seven years, teaching workshops,
[SPEAKER_03]: making hash and learning from both of them
equally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, and now I'm currently present
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the director of manufacturing at
Heritage Hash Co.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heritage Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're located in Ukiah, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at 1076 Cunningham Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Ukiah and we're a we call ourselves the
world's first public cannabis hash three
[SPEAKER_03]: for we are retail location, but you can
all you can see into my lab and see the
[SPEAKER_03]: product being made as you buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can go up to the window and ask
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's really beautiful because I
really feel like, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really fills that value of educating
the public and keeping it open to the
[SPEAKER_03]: public and paying it forward in that light
like Frenchy did, in a sense, to many of
[SPEAKER_03]: us who was just open source and just
answered anyone's questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So any time anyone comes to the window and
knocks and has a question, I will take the
[SPEAKER_03]: time out of my day to answer it in
spirits, you know, in the spirit of
[SPEAKER_03]: Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep it brief because I know we have
a couple of people to get through here.
[SPEAKER_22]: So thanks, Bell.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really sweet.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like Craig.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're next on the list.
[SPEAKER_13]: Craig, could you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep it pretty brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're boarding a flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had all sorts of travel changes,
so I just wanted to make sure I was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to jump on and say good morning to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Craig from Alpenglow Farms here in
southern Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I back their boss mama have
been at it for a few years up here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I just want to share just
in case I do get cut off that when Frenchy
[SPEAKER_00]: came to visit our farm for the first time
and we walked around and drove around on
[SPEAKER_00]: the four-wheeler to check everything out,
he was just so happy to see how we're
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating, you know, just on the natural
surfaces of the land, following the
[SPEAKER_00]: contours and working with what the land
provided and just on the side of a
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just ear to ear grinning as he
does and laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just absolutely amazing to
share our space and just have him visit
[SPEAKER_00]: our community and get excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when he first was coming into the
Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll leave it at that and much love to
everyone and look forward to hearing as
[SPEAKER_00]: much conversation as I can through this
morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really lovely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Next in line is Etienne.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, I'm Etienne.
[SPEAKER_12]: I own a dispensary in California and
Frenchy came to me when he first was
[SPEAKER_12]: trying to get involved and I was very
honored that he did and humbled and just
[SPEAKER_12]: gave him advice as I would give anybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: And needless to say, he heard it and I was
able to spend wonderful moments with him.
[SPEAKER_12]: My most memorable would be our 200
questions we shared.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which was a lot of fun, which I need to do
with bubble man and all of you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got these 200 cannabis questions and
now we're down to 50.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that way, you know, you know which
ones.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's just humbled and honored to be
here as, you know, a fellow hash
[SPEAKER_12]: appreciator.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you, Madam Bell, for keeping the
tradition alive.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you, Madam Canole, for doing
everything you can to keep your wonderful
[SPEAKER_12]: spouse's memory alive.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because he left so much for us all.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you for continuing that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So humbled and honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that afternoon, it's funny,
I was just looking the other day,
[SPEAKER_22]: I found the file.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's two and a half hours, the two of you
talking and answering the questions.
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's some real gems in there that I
need to dust off and post.
[SPEAKER_22]: You got him to tell some great stories.
[SPEAKER_22]: So, yeah, we definitely need to share that
with the world.
[SPEAKER_22]: Looks like from the top of my page,
the next in line would be our friends at
[SPEAKER_22]: Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so lovely to see you all this
morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nighttime here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we wouldn't miss this commemoration
for the world, really.
[SPEAKER_19]: Six o'clock in the afternoon is actually a
pretty good time to do a hash church.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're feeling pretty stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we're here at the GWA Smoke Club
in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were here a month ago with Steve and
Green Life, Steve and Kwani from Green
[SPEAKER_19]: Life.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we came to Barcelona,
we really, really felt the impact of
[SPEAKER_19]: Frenchy Canole and all of the work that
French has put out there because the love
[SPEAKER_19]: for hash is here in a way that you just,
you know, you see it in a lot of places,
[SPEAKER_19]: but there's just a huge amount of
appreciation here.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been really taken in by the GWA.
[SPEAKER_19]: GWA family feeling really blessed to be
here.
[SPEAKER_19]: We know Marcus is coming soon.
[SPEAKER_19]: Most importantly, we're just really
thankful for Frenchy and to have mentors
[SPEAKER_19]: in your life like Frenchy and elders that
really hold the space in a way that's
[SPEAKER_19]: classy and fun and strong is something we
always appreciated from Frenchy and you,
[SPEAKER_19]: Kimberly, and everyone that's worked with
him in the past.
[SPEAKER_19]: We feel very honored to be here today.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a lot of respect for everyone
that's on this panel and everyone that's
[SPEAKER_19]: listening.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to say one more thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just wanted to say that one thing,
you know, that we are focused on in
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragonfly Earth Medicine is just really
education, education for community,
[SPEAKER_02]: education for regenerative medicine and
connecting with Frenchy on that level was
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely one of the highlights of my
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: He changed the way I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: He challenged so many ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would take apart everything that you
would say and want to rebuild it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenchy way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that, I have so much love
for him and the education that this movie
[SPEAKER_02]: and Kimberly that you continue to spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like Josh said, I am telling you his
energy is felt so strongly here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The love for Josh, temple balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are talking about it the Frenchy
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I'm rolling at the Frenchy way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels so amazing to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I'm really feeling like he's
here this span of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot to be here with you.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of Moroccan influence here,
which we know is deep in Frenchy's heart.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much, everyone.
[SPEAKER_19]: We look forward to the show.
[SPEAKER_22]: Next step on the little bar across the top
mark.
[SPEAKER_22]: The two of us haven't met.
[SPEAKER_22]: So nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Kimberly.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_22]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, AT&T and everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: So great to see Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Frenchy and I only met once.
[SPEAKER_05]: We tried to meet a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as you know, Frenchy drew a crowd
wherever he went.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we always found it tense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And deep, whenever we came to his booth,
and we were never able to hook up at a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of the cups we were trying to hook
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we finally did meet, it was an
honor to meet him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was at a gold key event in Las
Vegas a few years back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just so cool because he was
actually part of the registration process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anybody who went to that event met
Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we had a little moment later on
over by the pool where, yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: so what I got from him just because I
remember watching him at these events is,
[SPEAKER_05]: again, to speak with Josh and Kelly just
said how he was the educator, the
[SPEAKER_05]: consummate educator, and how there was a
whole group of people around him that was
[SPEAKER_05]: absorbing everything he was saying,
everything he was doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why, like in so many ways,
he's like people who've passed before who
[SPEAKER_05]: have left such an inspiration in their
educational time on this brief period that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're on this shining blue ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was so meant for him to be that
educator who brought his passion and his
[SPEAKER_05]: journey that only he singularly took in
life to discover hash and hashish and
[SPEAKER_05]: bring it to everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now every time we smoke it,
we can remember him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just such an honor to be here and
such an honor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know you, Kimberly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's very kind of you.
[SPEAKER_22]: Nikki, it looks like you're next.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm happy you can join us deep in the
snow, snowed in there in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really deep up here.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we got another six inches or so
last night.
[SPEAKER_21]: So Swami has been out scraping snow and
ice off the solar panels right now to make
[SPEAKER_21]: sure we continue to have power.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it has been going in and out quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we fade away, just understand we're
just out hanging out with the snowman.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's pretty thick up here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, it's an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Swami will be back in a second.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know he'd love to say hi, too.
[SPEAKER_21]: And of course, it's always an honor to be
in a room with such an amazing group of
[SPEAKER_21]: people.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Kimberly.
[SPEAKER_21]: And thank you, Marcus, for bringing us all
together.
[SPEAKER_21]: And as always, it's wonderful to honor
Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, this is a man we're going to be
talking about forever.
[SPEAKER_21]: And he's really going down in the books as
one of the greats.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's just so happy to have known him
and spent time.
[SPEAKER_21]: And this movie is amazing.
[SPEAKER_21]: Swami hasn't even seen it yet.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's going to get to see it April 29th,
finally.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there goes the electricity.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, let's go further up north to humble
Dylan and let's check out some of the
greats.
So thank you all for joining us.
[SPEAKER_22]: Try your bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't have any intention of stopping
and do it in honor of Frenchy every day.
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you all.
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks, Nikki.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Dylan.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dylan, did your there you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good morning, Kim and Josh and Kelly
and everybody else on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a honor to be invited with with all
of you folks to talk and honor Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm up in Honeydew in the Matole Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and really, I I found Frenchy when he
found us out here in the Matole.
He.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy and Leo met my good friend,
Josh Fried, and at Empress Farms and and
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh, they really hit it off right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and Josh brought Frenchy out to the
valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Frenchy fell in love with our little
valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and we just all fell in love with
Frenchy, our little community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he became a mentor for us all and
really, really opened our eyes to to what
[SPEAKER_01]: we knew existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't really we just didn't
understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still we're learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this connection between, you know,
place and plant and people and terroir and
[SPEAKER_01]: and what that all really means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and he really mentored us in that in
that idea of Appalachians and that this
[SPEAKER_01]: was something really important and that we
we needed to take it seriously and that if
[SPEAKER_01]: we wanted to talk about how the the weed
that we grow here in in the Matole Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: and in Humboldt is special, that it's not
something you can just lightly say that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to talk about this,
you really need to take it seriously and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a respect for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the the old traditions of what
these these words like Appalachians mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and he was he was he was really intent
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that like, don't say that unless you
are serious and you're going to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: work and there's science and there's work
and you can't just throw this around
[SPEAKER_01]: lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he really was a mentor and he told
us books to read and sent us links and
[SPEAKER_01]: came and visited and talked with us and
introduced us to to all sorts of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I just just what what an
honor and a privilege to have have gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: to know Frenchy and have him in our home
and have him, you know, come and cook for
[SPEAKER_01]: us sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, you know, what great
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he he he certainly his spirit is still
here with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and with the work that we're trying to
continue on, he's a he's an inspiration
[SPEAKER_01]: for us for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so thank you, Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Kimberly.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_22]: Wade, it looks like you're next on our
little list.
[SPEAKER_22]: So nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_22]: I have seen you virtually, but I don't
think we've met physically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Wade Laughter here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, we haven't met specifically,
but I.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could say some of the same things that
Dr. Mark said about the couple of times I
[SPEAKER_04]: managed to run into Frenchy, he was
surrounded by a mob and I've always been a
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of a hermit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just gave him plenty of space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually did invest a couple of times in
some of his work for my own personal joy,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, yeah, I would say this might my
experience of Frenchy as I've watched some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the videos he's made.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like as a traveler, he discovered a
culture and developed a passion for it in
[SPEAKER_04]: different countries where traditional hash
making was being practiced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he took the part, if you will,
of those cultures and brought it to the
[SPEAKER_04]: work here in the West and taught us again.
[SPEAKER_04]: He his approach was I don't have any
secrets.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to share with you what I've learned
and maybe I'll learn something,
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be talking about me, but that was
my sense of Frenchy, that he was so open
[SPEAKER_04]: to the people who did who did manage to
fight through the crowd and talk to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did actually a couple of years back,
just before the Emerald Cup, the Dragonfly
[SPEAKER_04]: Earth Medicine family, I, Judge and Kelly
had a gathering and I can't remember the
[SPEAKER_04]: woman's name, whose place it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, Frenchy came.
[SPEAKER_04]: He brought his his big hookah and I did
have a chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Josh.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that was a wonderful night.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I got there early and he got
there late and chance to share his work
[SPEAKER_04]: directly through his hookah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is a lot where I got my sense of
his love for what he was doing,
[SPEAKER_04]: that I don't have any secrets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drink deeply of what I have experienced in
my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's an inspiration to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's a lot where my love for
this plant comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen what the plant can do for
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, I'm a medicine maker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frenchy was a medicine maker and an
inspiration to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for this event.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it took me a few hours and a
pretty strong discussion with my wife for
[SPEAKER_04]: me to get out of the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: And off the mountain and into a town where
there's electricity and Internet because I
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to be here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I may not stay till the end of the
church because it is still snowing up
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got we lost power and Internet on
Monday, today, Sunday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're supposed to have a couple more
feet between now and Tuesday and a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: more feet by Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I want to get home.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're well situated and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this event and my love for Frenchy and
his inspiration to me was enough to get me
[SPEAKER_04]: off the hill to join this group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am really grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for the event.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to all of you who showed up and
much love.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's so sweet.
[SPEAKER_22]: Did I miss anybody?
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not a master Zoom.
[SPEAKER_22]: Marcus, is there anybody that I didn't
reach because I can't see them for some
reason?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think there is one person in here as
a Zoom user with their camera off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure who that is, but yeah,
it seems like we've got through everyone
[SPEAKER_07]: else here on the panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the user is now gone.
[SPEAKER_21]: Kimberly, Swami is here now.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_21]: Fresh from the solar panels in the snow.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a little out of breath.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 30 inches deep out there.
[SPEAKER_20]: Last night, I had to go out and scrape off
the satellite dish thing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I had to scrape off the solar panels
as they had a bunch of snow.
[SPEAKER_20]: The snow was over my boots and my fingers
were cold.
[SPEAKER_20]: But that's the report.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, okay, Frenchy would love snow,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_20]: Frenchy, well, what a great friend he was.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we had a lot of good times together.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we had that special connection from
Goa.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have a lot of mutual friends who
knew Frenchy as Cami back in Goa.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right?
[SPEAKER_20]: He was a whole nother character back
there.
[SPEAKER_20]: But he realized his full true life's
purpose when he came to California,
[SPEAKER_20]: right?
[SPEAKER_20]: Because he was looking to make the best
hash.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he finally realized to make the best
hash, you need the best flower.
[SPEAKER_20]: And when he came here, I think the
terpenes blew the top off of his head.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that was just the whole thing that
he dived in.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he was kind of in many ways chronology
wise, he was kind of a latecomer to the
[SPEAKER_20]: scene.
[SPEAKER_20]: But boy, he got right to the middle as
soon as he could.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he found the best farms all in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he made the best hash.
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I'm going to change my socks because
they're soaking wet.
[SPEAKER_22]: And last but not least, the mystery Zoom
user is here.
[SPEAKER_22]: Would you like to introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, I'm Brett Bird.
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess I'm Zoom user.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not very savvy with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm really glad to be here and very
honored to be a part of this.
[SPEAKER_18]: Frenchy meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I never met anybody with such a
passion and love for this and willing to
[SPEAKER_18]: share his passion and love.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it really means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I try to pass on some of what he had
said.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to pass on that passion and
love that he instilled in me and to
[SPEAKER_18]: everybody that wants to hear anything
about hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll keep it short.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't really want to start crying on you
guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay to cry.
[SPEAKER_12]: We love him and we miss him.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's okay to share that we love him
and we miss him.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_22]: So Tien, I've been trying to get you to
see the movie.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so many other people have been asking
me about when they can see it.
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're going to make it happen April
29th.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's going to be available via email.
[SPEAKER_22]: And we have a bunch of people all over the
world that are going to be scheduling some
[SPEAKER_22]: in-person events so that some people can
get together and watch it together,
[SPEAKER_22]: smoke it together.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then after that, we're going to do a
live stream so that we can talk about the
[SPEAKER_22]: film so that I can get the filmmaker
online with us and you guys can ask him
[SPEAKER_22]: some questions and we can just hear what
you all think about the film and the
[SPEAKER_22]: experience.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't thank you enough for finally
putting it online.
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, every time that it's aired,
my mother's in hospice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've had to travel back to Mississippi
to visit and be with her.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just been a series of unhappy
accidents, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I am beyond excited.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will have my own little watch party
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I probably with my veterans action council
friends will probably get together and do
[SPEAKER_12]: a little watch party out of love.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause Frenchie was an inspiration to all
of us.
[SPEAKER_19]: We also haven't seen it yet.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're waiting to see it.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were going to maybe get to see it at
the hive in California while we were
[SPEAKER_19]: there, but it didn't get to happen.
[SPEAKER_19]: Alucna was there.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was beautiful to spend time with
her.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, just really stoked to see it up
in Alberta.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause I think it's going to be in Edmonton
where we see it at the grow off.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that might be a really fun place to
finally see it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know the family here in Barcelona
want to see it as well.
[SPEAKER_22]: Another of the social clubs are going to
hold a little screening.
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's going to be an option for a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's lovely.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would shout out to the grow up for
being so supportive of the film.
[SPEAKER_22]: They kind of set this precedent of
screening the film and selling tickets.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then they're donating the money to the
nonprofit that we're working with the
[SPEAKER_22]: origins council, because Dylan and some of
the farmers featured in the film are doing
[SPEAKER_22]: a little project on cannabis terroir.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so we're using the donations to help
support those scientific studies.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're pretty stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're incredibly grateful,
Kimberly, for the help that you've and the
[SPEAKER_01]: support, both financially, but just with,
you hold a lot of that wisdom that Francie
[SPEAKER_01]: shared with all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, we're really, all of us out here
in the Matole are incredibly grateful to
[SPEAKER_01]: have you be participating and helping with
us in that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the spirit of Francie
living on for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to try to do right by him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's complicated science and it's not
something that's been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's certainly challenging,
but through working with origins council
[SPEAKER_01]: and Swamini, I appreciate you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're on the board of OC and
they've connected us with some really
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible advisors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're working with leaf works who has
put together an experiment that we will be
[SPEAKER_01]: diving into full scale this summer and
really trying to, to make this causal link
[SPEAKER_01]: connection between the place and the plant
and how it expresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so thank you for mentioning that
Kimberly.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just reading the newspaper yesterday
that, you know, so this whole concept of
[SPEAKER_22]: having a terroir that's then used to
create an appellation, which is this legal
[SPEAKER_22]: structure to kind of protect the small
farmers for these recognized agro,
[SPEAKER_22]: agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_22]: They have this precedent in Europe where
they've used it for cheese and for wine
[SPEAKER_22]: and for, you know, sausage products in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_22]: But unfortunately in the U S we don't have
much respect for this.
[SPEAKER_22]: I just saw yesterday that the government
had ruled that they're going to allow
[SPEAKER_22]: American to be sold as Gruyere when this
is a product that has a named protection
[SPEAKER_22]: in Europe.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's a little frustrating that somehow
this concept is not honored or that it's
[SPEAKER_22]: somehow appropriated and just like anybody
can use it if they make a cheese that has
[SPEAKER_22]: holes in it and has been aged for more
than 90 days.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think that's kind of a similar thing
with some of the challenges our industry
[SPEAKER_22]: has experienced with legalization,
having these like mega grows that led the
[SPEAKER_22]: market with product that is, you know,
not doesn't meet the same standards.
[SPEAKER_22]: There needs to be a way to differentiate
so that the dispensaries, the consumers,
[SPEAKER_22]: other people are able to have access to
quality that they want.
[SPEAKER_22]: And Frenchy, that was his whole focus with
his travels.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, one of the main things was he
always wanted to have access to the best
[SPEAKER_22]: product and realized you had to go to the
farmers, that the source of the quality
[SPEAKER_22]: was the farmers.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I can't think of a better way to
support his legacy than to fund things
[SPEAKER_22]: that emphasize that quality and help the
legacy farmers have their correct place in
[SPEAKER_22]: the marketplace, in the efforts of what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Frenchy and I talked about that,
as you well know, Kimberly, forever and
[SPEAKER_20]: ever and ever.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we had some very energetic discussions
in the typical Frenchy way.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I've lived in South America enough to
know that shouting and screaming is just
[SPEAKER_20]: passion, not anger.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.
[SPEAKER_20]: But for all of you who don't know so much
about Appalachian in France, which,
[SPEAKER_20]: as you say, it started hundreds of years
ago, first with Roquefort cheese,
[SPEAKER_20]: because some king wanted to be sure it was
Roquefort cheese.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, there's like 10 pages of Appalachian
on farm goods, on agricultural products,
[SPEAKER_20]: crops.
[SPEAKER_20]: In France, there's Appalachian butter,
there's saffron, there's honey,
[SPEAKER_20]: there's lavender, all these different
things, which are like French basil,
[SPEAKER_20]: so on.
[SPEAKER_20]: They're special products that get their
special flavor and quality from the soil
[SPEAKER_20]: that they're grown in and from the culture
of the farmers who are the ones doing the
[SPEAKER_20]: growing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the farmers are the carrier of the
intellectual product.
[SPEAKER_20]: They're the carrier of the intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_20]: And when you have a collective of farmers,
they have a group knowledge, a group
[SPEAKER_20]: understanding, wisdom that develops over
the years.
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, some people would argue that in the
cannabis world, we haven't been doing it
[SPEAKER_20]: quite long enough to have that fundamental
wisdom of the people.
[SPEAKER_20]: But we do have a lot of that and we do
know and we do share that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's one of the key things about an
Appalachian that the standards practices
[SPEAKER_20]: and varietals are determined by the
farmers themselves, not by a state
[SPEAKER_20]: bureaucratic department.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's key also to the French way of
doing which is adapted also by the entire
[SPEAKER_20]: European Union.
[SPEAKER_20]: So there are many, many, many agricultural
crops that do have what they call the
[SPEAKER_20]: flavor or the taste of the place where
they grow, right?
[SPEAKER_20]: Curiously enough, in the United States,
there is not a single true French style
[SPEAKER_20]: Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_20]: They do not exist.
[SPEAKER_20]: And there you'll see driving around
certain wine areas and they'll say
[SPEAKER_20]: Appalachian on the sign and they legally
cannot use that word.
[SPEAKER_20]: The technical word is geographic
indicator, right?
[SPEAKER_20]: They can use a geographical indicator if
it's grown in that area.
[SPEAKER_20]: We have it now in cannabis as well,
because you can put the name of your
[SPEAKER_20]: county and say it was grown in that county
if you can verify that 100% of the product
[SPEAKER_20]: in the jar is from that county.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we do get county of designation,
but that's simply a geographical,
[SPEAKER_20]: there are no standards practices and
varietals for that.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the key to Appalachian how it's
gonna play out in the United States.
[SPEAKER_20]: California was the first state to actually
legally put that word and those
[SPEAKER_20]: qualifications onto any product and it's
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't exist for any other product in
the U.S., right?
[SPEAKER_20]: Everyone in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_20]: says all lawyers you talk to say,
well, just get a trademark, it's the same
[SPEAKER_20]: thing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And you kind of look at them and say,
well, you don't quite understand this,
[SPEAKER_20]: do you?
[SPEAKER_20]: Because a trademark can be bought and
sold, it can be moved, it's owned by
[SPEAKER_20]: somebody.
[SPEAKER_20]: There are people in Florida selling
Humboldt, this and that and the other
[SPEAKER_20]: thing, right?
[SPEAKER_20]: So the thing is that an Appalachian only
belongs to the farmers who create it.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they have to then create a business
entity of some sort to enforce it.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they also then create their own
standards practices and varietals.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I'll kind of let off on this,
cause I could go deep down in the hole
[SPEAKER_20]: like Frenchy always used to do.
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you have other questions and thanks
also for mentioning the Origins Council,
[SPEAKER_20]: because we started in 2015, that's eight
years ago now, folks.
[SPEAKER_20]: We started in 2015 talking about
Appalachian, Janine and I and Justin
[SPEAKER_20]: Calvino for the Mendocino Appalachian
projects.
[SPEAKER_20]: That then grew into Origins Council and so
many more people came on board.
[SPEAKER_20]: And now all the legacy growing areas are
represented by Origins Council and we'll
[SPEAKER_20]: keep getting more people too.
[SPEAKER_20]: So Origins Council is really the only
spokesperson, Janine particularly adept at
[SPEAKER_20]: it for the small farmer of the legacy
growers of California.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it needs all our support that we can
give it.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm really excited that the film is
donating 20% of all of our proceeds
[SPEAKER_22]: forever to the efforts of the Origins
Council because I think that it's not only
[SPEAKER_22]: important for California, you guys are
setting a precedent for things that are
[SPEAKER_22]: gonna happen all over the world.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I keep thinking, if you guys can
create the model and get legal
[SPEAKER_22]: recognition, then maybe we can help
protect the legacy farmers in Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_22]: or Lebanon once things legalize worldwide.
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I just feel like those traditions,
Northern India, those places where we had
[SPEAKER_22]: such profound experiences when we were
young, they need the protection as well.
[SPEAKER_22]: So this work that we're doing,
it's not just for us.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really to set a standard around
legacy cannabis worldwide, outdoor
[SPEAKER_22]: sun-grown cannabis and this tradition of
making hashish in these really old
[SPEAKER_22]: cultures that I think it's really
important for humanity.
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree 100%, Kimberly, because that was
always part of my reference too,
[SPEAKER_20]: because I haven't smoked as many places as
Frenchy probably, but I miss Northern
[SPEAKER_20]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I smoked in Israel, I smoked in
Afghanistan, in Amsterdam, in Nepal,
[SPEAKER_20]: even in China.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's like Thailand.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's really a worldwide thing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And one of the things that working with
hashish, it is to remember that this is a
[SPEAKER_20]: plant that's been helping humanity for at
least 10, 20,000 years, right?
[SPEAKER_22]: The Mendocino bandwidth has struck again.
[SPEAKER_20]: While we wait for... Also, as you just
said Kimberly, protect the small farmer in
[SPEAKER_20]: Morocco, in Lebanon, anywhere that people
are growing quality and have a skill that
[SPEAKER_20]: is an ancient tradition.
[SPEAKER_20]: Walking along the terraces in Northern
India in the mountains and you turn around
[SPEAKER_20]: a corner and you see this terrace and all
of a sudden there's 20 foot high cannabis
[SPEAKER_20]: plants there with birds roosting in the
branches and so on.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's right next to the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then they come down and there's some
lady, she's rubbing this hash like this
[SPEAKER_20]: and you get a little smoke from it and so
on.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just, you go over to visit somebody
and they invite you in for tea and
[SPEAKER_20]: biscuits and then they light up a chillum.
[SPEAKER_20]: And you're smoking now a chillum with the
mayor of the village and the director of
[SPEAKER_20]: the school system.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's just part of their culture that
is a whole sort of way of life.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I still remember the first little old
farmer who taught me how to use it to
[SPEAKER_20]: chillum way back in the mountains of
Nepal.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so he said, no, no, no, that's not
right.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's not right here.
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_20]: And just wanting to share that sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so it's a tradition that we're part of
and we need to be proud of it and share
[SPEAKER_20]: it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd just like to add that India also
taught us how to recognize the small
[SPEAKER_19]: farmers with their protest that happened
in India last year.
[SPEAKER_19]: The Indian farmers protest really stood up
for small farmers and how they can out
[SPEAKER_19]: produce corporate farming while producing
a higher quality.
[SPEAKER_19]: And India really does uphold community
farming and community gardening.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's another nice aspect for us to
learn which Frenchie also kept that India
[SPEAKER_19]: connection and all that knowledge going.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for everything that was said.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also welcome, Lena.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's beautiful to see you today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I just wanted to add one more thing,
Dylan, you said, we hope that we can live
[SPEAKER_02]: up to Frenchie's expectations and live up
to his moral compass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that that's what we're
talking about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about every single one of
those trichomes, those crystals to be
[SPEAKER_02]: farmed by a small farmer in community,
in recognition of the soil in that area
[SPEAKER_02]: and in that terroir while sharing seeds
with the local community of what grows
[SPEAKER_02]: best there, while then sharing education
on how to make the best resins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is living up to Frenchie's moral
compass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the importance of his legacy
and Kimberly, this movie and everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: here who is watching and everybody who
continues to keep Frenchie's voice alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it isn't just about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about the education that he was
putting forward, which now becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: surrounded in heart, space and community
and love and medicine and people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it continues to come back to the
farmers and the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think that that's the legacy
that we have to live up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's incredibly important for us to
continue to spark that bright light that
[SPEAKER_02]: he carried always.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's that element.
[SPEAKER_22]: He used to say we made too much of him and
that it wasn't about him.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was about the traditions.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was about this evolution of passing
on the traditions and how important that
[SPEAKER_22]: was.
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for emphasizing that aspect of
community, because I'll just say one
[SPEAKER_11]: thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: This film is for Frenchie, is a film of
dry seeds for remember your soul.
[SPEAKER_11]: Blessings and love.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_20]: Listen, when you brought up India just
now, I had a flashback researching the
[SPEAKER_20]: origins of the organic regenerative food
movement.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I can't remember the guy's name,
but I'm an English scientist who went out
[SPEAKER_20]: to India in the early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he was going to teach all those Indian
people how to grow using industrial
[SPEAKER_20]: chemicals, salt-based petroleum chemicals,
and he was going to increase their yield
[SPEAKER_20]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so he was doing that.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then after about four years,
his yield started to go down and his
[SPEAKER_20]: quality wasn't very good.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he noticed that the farmers around who
weren't doing what he told them to do were
[SPEAKER_20]: actually doing better, that their crop was
more.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so he started to research,
hey, what are these people doing?
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, they've only been doing this for the
last 10,000 years or what have you.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they've kind of figured out how their
environment interacts with their products.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they have special cultivars.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they were using the new, and they were
using organic methods that we now are
[SPEAKER_20]: referring to as regenerative methods.
[SPEAKER_20]: So primitive local little farmers eking
out a tiny little crop were doing way
[SPEAKER_20]: better than this fancy scientist from
England.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he had the smarts and the humility to
turn around and say, I can learn from
[SPEAKER_20]: these people.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so he did.
[SPEAKER_20]: And out of that came the Rodali and all
these other things that we call organic.
[SPEAKER_20]: But it originated with little local
farmers in India who've been doing this
[SPEAKER_20]: for, I don't know, seven or 8,000 years.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have a tradition.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that moral standard that you brought
up is a really great thing about how to be
[SPEAKER_20]: honest with yourself and honest with your
food and honest with your medicine and how
[SPEAKER_20]: that has to pervade our whole life and be
part of our basic ethic and what we share
[SPEAKER_20]: with people, because this is truth we're
working on.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what we're working with here.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of that is what we try to embody
with the DEM peer certification.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's five, six people here from that.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we really do work our best at
projecting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just recognizing that we are creating
local Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this capability to talk to you all
live.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have these capabilities to learn from
each other no matter what language.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, Google Instant Translate is amazing
and how quickly that we can communicate
[SPEAKER_02]: with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this thread of our connection to
nature and connection to community is
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that Frenchie was about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that continues to move forward.
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, Peter Proctor wrote a really amazing
book.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's from New Zealand, went to India.
[SPEAKER_19]: One man, one cow.
[SPEAKER_19]: One man, one cow.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a biodynamic way of closed loop
farming in India.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'd like to say a little something
about Frenchie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our paths crossed more than a few times
for certain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things I loved about him,
as everyone's already mentioned,
[SPEAKER_08]: is I thought I was passionate about
hashish.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I'd met passionate people about
hashish.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had traveled to hashish countries.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had gone to the Maha Kumbh Mela and
smoked hashish with the Babas on the side
[SPEAKER_08]: with the Ganges.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did all sorts of amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I traveled to the Bobo Shanti communities
in Jamaica and helped make hash with those
[SPEAKER_08]: guys, with the lamb spread, and did all of
these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm also French.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's also my lineage.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm about 50% to 60% Français.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we were able to speak French when
we would bump into one another.
[SPEAKER_08]: But his absolute passion was just
radiating off the man in a way that you
[SPEAKER_08]: really kind of had to be numb or dead
inside to not almost be overwhelmed by it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, obviously, I love hashish.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love talking about hashish.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love connecting the dots.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Frenchie really took it to another
level.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't get to spend as much time as
I would have liked to with him,
[SPEAKER_08]: as we were on similar paths in different
places that seemed to cross paths.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the last time I got to hang out with
him was in a very private setting,
[SPEAKER_08]: as Wade mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: Frenchie often had a crowd around him.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had showed up at HQ in Barcelona,
my friend David's Club, a club of which I
[SPEAKER_08]: was one of the first members of eight or
nine years ago when I first went into that
[SPEAKER_08]: club, when it was brand new.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm busy right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to go upstairs to my little
private area there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll come and see you later.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I went up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just Frenchie sitting up there
by himself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he didn't even tell me that Frenchie
was up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Frenchie and I got to sit in HQ and
smoke hash and play with hash and talk
[SPEAKER_08]: about hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a lovely way for us to spend
our last time together.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll definitely hold that dear.
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember that for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just thank Frenchie for everything
that he brought to the community.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all sorts of different people
doing all sorts of different things.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he really made a mark that's not going
to be going away.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Wade also mentioned the way he brought
that heart of the culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: As I experienced legal cannabis in Canada,
as I experienced Vale purchasing Whistler,
[SPEAKER_08]: these corporate entities that try to come
in and eliminate the culture that existed
[SPEAKER_08]: at the core.
[SPEAKER_08]: And whenever they do it, it ruins good
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to have someone like Frenchie take that
core information out of Himachal Pradesh
[SPEAKER_08]: and out of Malana and Parvati Valley and
these very special zones that a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: people have never been able to go to and
visit and sort of bring that into the new
[SPEAKER_08]: world.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really what Legends of Hash was
always about trying to pay homage to the
[SPEAKER_08]: elders, to the culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: I meet a lot of people in the cannabis
industries.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been doing this since the 60s.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm one of the OGs.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I like to think of the actual
people who are doing it four, five,
[SPEAKER_08]: six, seven, 800 years ago, a thousand
years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can't forget about them either
because they're the true OGs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that Frenchie carried them
with him wherever he went.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he emanated that energy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see everyone on this panel will now
carry that with us for the rest of our
[SPEAKER_08]: Hashish days.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once again, Boom Shankara, Shankara
Mahadeva to Frenchie.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might be time to smoke a bowl
in his honor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed that Lena jumped on and I just
wanted to see if she wanted to say
[SPEAKER_03]: anything really quick because she didn't
get a chance to say anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss Lena, hi sister.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi Belle, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_16]: I was having technical difficulties this
morning.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for Dylan for saving the day.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to piggyback off of the beautiful
words you guys have already said.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, Frenchie wanted us just to lead
with passion and love what we were doing,
[SPEAKER_16]: dedicated to what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're not doing that, I mean,
what are you doing with your life?
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was always be in the pursuit of
happiness and betterment.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's how I like to lead.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know all of you here on this panel
love to lead as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was an honor to be able to work closely
with Frenchie and under him and learn from
[SPEAKER_16]: him.
[SPEAKER_16]: The first moment I met him, I had just
gotten into hash making and just wanted to
[SPEAKER_16]: better my hash making skills and just the
radiance he like emanated in the room.
[SPEAKER_16]: The moment I met him, I was just like
sold.
[SPEAKER_16]: He could have been talking about anything
and whatever it was, I want to do exactly
[SPEAKER_16]: that and learn exactly that and be that
person.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_16]: So he definitely helped me further my love
for hash making.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he really believed in me well before I
believed in myself.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the moment I brought him my first hash
after taking his class, he was just mind
[SPEAKER_16]: blown.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that really kind of just gave me a lot
of determination and knowing that I was
[SPEAKER_16]: going on the right path and working with
the right material.
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, really happy to have known him.
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't get over how some of your recent
posts, if they hadn't been posted under
[SPEAKER_22]: your name, it would look like stuff
Frenchie posted five, six years ago,
[SPEAKER_22]: especially the ones where you're really
showing the full dimension of the
[SPEAKER_22]: brightness the way he did, where he would
line the washes up so that you could see
[SPEAKER_22]: the variation in color.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then when they pancake, it's just such
a joy to see that because that was the
[SPEAKER_22]: ultimate goal was to harvest the chikums
in such a way that you were getting almost
[SPEAKER_22]: the pure resin.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then when you leave it for a second,
it just falls under its weight.
[SPEAKER_22]: It just feels like there's, I don't know,
some kind of like we're talking about this
[SPEAKER_22]: tradition and this evolution, like those
things connect back to humans,
[SPEAKER_22]: to great grandparents that we don't even
know that we have somehow in foreign
[SPEAKER_22]: countries.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to add, Alina, I'm actually
smoking your stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my three-hole bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to that note, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kimberly is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I see your photos, I'm like,
it looks exactly like Frenchie's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually kind of brings tears to my
eyes a little bit, because I'm just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: that you really nailed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your pressed hashish is just so
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really hits home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually all I've been smoking
for the past two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, girl.
[SPEAKER_16]: I made my year.
[SPEAKER_16]: As always, credit to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm nothing without them.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm working with some amazing farmers in a
beautiful valley.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I definitely feel Frenchie's spirit in
my workspace.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm definitely harnessing him and trying
to make him proud.
[SPEAKER_16]: So thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to the farmer again,
thank you for mentioning that,
[SPEAKER_03]: Lina, because I love that we are only as
good as the farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the product that we work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, shout out to the farmer and to
the land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frenchie used to tell me, I think the most
beautiful thing about you, Lina,
[SPEAKER_03]: and even Bird, you guys work very closely
with a farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really represent the land and that
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, in my experience,
that's just been the most profound impact
[SPEAKER_03]: is environmental.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frenchie even used to say, when he was
traveling and producing countries,
[SPEAKER_03]: when he was traveling in the mountains,
people wouldn't care that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the one who made the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They asked him how far he went to go make
that hash, what altitude, what valley did
[SPEAKER_03]: he go to to make that hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same thing where,
as a craft hashishian, we kind of use the
[SPEAKER_03]: terroir, or the land, as the compass to
source our material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, you represent the Matul
Valley, the Lost Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bird represents Willett's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have the honor to represent a lot of
also Matul and other farmers, Brice Land,
[SPEAKER_03]: all these other comchi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's always these genetics,
and it's these genetics and these strains
[SPEAKER_03]: that farmers, the neighbors, have had for
a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been growing it for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been traded amongst that same area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's almost like those plants really
know that area and that land.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has the most profound impact when
it comes to the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, it always comes down to the land
and the farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, just want to give a shout out to
all the farmers who are on here right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate all of you very much.
[SPEAKER_16]: And in Frenchy's words, I mean,
unless you're doing it all yourself,
[SPEAKER_16]: which is really hard to do, we don't eat
and we don't smoke without the farmer.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have to give them the utmost respect
and love and take care of them because
[SPEAKER_16]: they take care of us and they take care of
the land they're working on.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the surrounding environments,
like a lot of work goes into this.
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank them regularly and support them.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well said, Lena.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to the fungi as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: We couldn't do it without the fungi,
the symbiotic relationship, that missing
[SPEAKER_08]: component that allows the plant to express
the terroir, you know, because that's
[SPEAKER_08]: really what cannabis is doing for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's allowing us to experience these
different areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love the fact that there are very
specific hashish cultures in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also love the fact that there are
terroirs for us to explore and to meet for
[SPEAKER_08]: the very first time.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be some zones that
cannabis is produced in in the upcoming
[SPEAKER_08]: decades that will express, I'm certain,
unlike anything we've ever experienced.
[SPEAKER_08]: And right now, there's no doubt about
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: California is definitely the center of the
cannabis universe.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's some other amazing terroirs
out in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I sometimes think that we're going to
be discovering some new ones as well here
[SPEAKER_08]: with this lovely plant that we all have
such a wonderful relationship with.
[SPEAKER_22]: I wonder about the whole aspect of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, when Frenchy was in the
mountains, he rented a field from some
[SPEAKER_22]: farmers up there for years.
[SPEAKER_22]: And the farmers used to cultivate those
fields by breaking it up and throwing
[SPEAKER_22]: seeds out, you know, year over year and
just letting the rain work its magic.
[SPEAKER_22]: And after the first year, Frenchy asked
them to stop doing that and to let the
[SPEAKER_22]: plants just go back to their wild state
and respond to the environment that they
[SPEAKER_22]: were in.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I had the most amazing conversation
with Kevin Jadri at one of the Gangier
[SPEAKER_22]: Council meetings where he talked about how
if you allowed the natural cultivar to
[SPEAKER_22]: express itself, there was the elements of
the humans that lived in that region and
[SPEAKER_22]: what they needed and that their needs were
going to be slightly different based on
[SPEAKER_22]: the environment that they were in and not
meaning not only like the weather that was
[SPEAKER_22]: there, but like if you're up north in
Canada and it's cold, maybe you don't want
[SPEAKER_22]: to be as energetic as somebody who's
living in the southern hemisphere and
[SPEAKER_22]: they're on a beach or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so kind of to your point, we have
humans that right now are directing the
[SPEAKER_22]: breeding of certain cultivars.
[SPEAKER_22]: What would happen if we threw the seeds
out there and let nature kind of develop a
[SPEAKER_22]: cultivar based on what they understood the
needs of the humans living there to be?
[SPEAKER_22]: I wonder how that might differ.
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's also this element of humans
breeding for very high levels of THC.
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody knows, I don't smoke anymore.
[SPEAKER_22]: The THC is too much for me.
[SPEAKER_22]: It overwhelms me.
[SPEAKER_22]: It overwhelms me immediately.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I just wonder in its natural
environment, looking at some of the
[SPEAKER_22]: studies that were done, for example,
in Israel at one point, the government
[SPEAKER_22]: commissioned studies using material from
bus that they had gathered.
[SPEAKER_22]: And this was like around 2014.
[SPEAKER_22]: And the THC level in the material that
they were getting from the smuggling
[SPEAKER_22]: operations was so low, like the charas was
three to 7%.
[SPEAKER_22]: The hashish was less than 17%.
[SPEAKER_22]: But I remember getting really,
really high in India when we were smoking
[SPEAKER_22]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_22]: So is it really necessary or a benefit,
these high THC levels?
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I know in California, when we sell
to dispensaries, they're like less than
[SPEAKER_22]: 30%.
[SPEAKER_22]: We won't even look at it.
[SPEAKER_22]: We won't even talk to you.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm just wondering if this is like,
is this the right path for humans to
[SPEAKER_22]: approach how the plants go?
[SPEAKER_22]: How is this cultivated and what makes it
to the shelves in a commercial
[SPEAKER_22]: environment?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a lot of it has been driven by
prohibition because prohibition drove a
[SPEAKER_12]: lot of neophyte smokers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when they smoked, they got so high.
[SPEAKER_12]: Experienced growers, and as Frenchy and
others have taught us, and one of the
[SPEAKER_12]: things that we found when we were
initially testing back in 08 and 09 is we
[SPEAKER_12]: had a lot of my first 1,500 tests before
we even released the results.
[SPEAKER_12]: We found that a lot of the chemical
structure was identical.
[SPEAKER_12]: Almost 90% of the cannabis was the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we knew there was something different.
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, we've come to realize it's
the terpene profiles, the chemovar
[SPEAKER_12]: profiles that are different in each that
we couldn't register under THC level.
[SPEAKER_12]: So back then, we had an issue.
[SPEAKER_12]: And a ethical issue and one that we're
still struggling under and one that we
[SPEAKER_12]: found is that, oh, shit, we're going to
have a causation in America because we
[SPEAKER_12]: have due to prohibition and alcohol
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's this fucked up mentality that the
higher the number, the more fucked up you
[SPEAKER_12]: get.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that causality is something we have
struggled with.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one, we had an organization back in
the arts called the Medical Cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: Safety Council, the MCSC.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was part of the contaminants committee.
[SPEAKER_12]: But one thing we struggled with on the
nomenclature committee was how do we
[SPEAKER_12]: address this issue?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we were able to show that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And unfortunately, Steve D'Angelo pushed
out testing quicker than we could come up
[SPEAKER_12]: with the understanding to convey to the
consumer that there's something happening,
[SPEAKER_12]: that the THC number does not matter.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's something that's else
happening within these flowers,
[SPEAKER_12]: these unique flowers that are having a
different effect on different people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we saw was people like Harborside
rejecting anything that didn't have now
[SPEAKER_12]: this now created fictitious THC level.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then all of a sudden, Berkeley
Patients Group had a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_12]: varietals that I had been wanting to have
for years come my way that I was able to
[SPEAKER_12]: purchase that I would have never had
before.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because now an imaginary line had been
driven into the sand that has
[SPEAKER_12]: unfortunately become the pervasive reality
since legalization has happened,
[SPEAKER_12]: because we've never been able to get
behind that Pandora's box once it was
[SPEAKER_12]: open.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has run away from us all.
[SPEAKER_12]: And unfortunately, we're still struggling
with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel a guilt mentally because we
were never able to do so.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I always have an anger at Steve
because Steve knew this, and we challenged
[SPEAKER_12]: him not to do this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he went at it because of dollars,
as opposed to the integrity needed so that
[SPEAKER_12]: we could convey it properly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry to explain that, but I wanted to
give a historical context from California.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I think it's responsible that
people understand where we fucked up,
[SPEAKER_12]: we had a chance to be good stewards here,
and we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so y'all can do better than us learn
from our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's hard to let ganja be wild and
be intelligent in the soil and just
[SPEAKER_19]: interact with our spirits.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then if we had a good number and so on
and the high THC, we had something that
[SPEAKER_20]: came in at like eight THC and six CBD.
[SPEAKER_20]: And everybody loved it, but we couldn't
sell it because it just didn't have that
[SPEAKER_20]: high THC number.
[SPEAKER_20]: So one of the things that Frenchy and
Madam Canole and Nikki and I, and about 15
[SPEAKER_20]: other people, we worked to create the
ganja council and the ganja program.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the purpose of that, it's still in the
process of being developed further and so
[SPEAKER_20]: on.
[SPEAKER_20]: But to get to a place where we could come
out with a score at the end of an
[SPEAKER_20]: evaluation based on a hundred points that
would not be determined by THC.
[SPEAKER_20]: And everybody's buying by one number,
the THC number.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we said, well, we want to look at the
appearance.
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to look at the flavor.
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to look at the aroma.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we look at all these things and we
come out with a hundred point scale.
[SPEAKER_20]: So Frenchy was very much key and Madam
Canole as well in developing that program.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_20]: The point about this, I think,
Etienne, is to educate the customer,
[SPEAKER_20]: educate the consumer.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's on us.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what we have to do.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have to do it every day,
all day.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have to go through the nose,
as we all well know.
[SPEAKER_20]: The secret to cannabis is always through
the aroma and the nose.
[SPEAKER_20]: Because in my research now, I'm going to
say this, there's a great book,
[SPEAKER_20]: which I really highly recommend for all of
you.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's called Nose Dive.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's this amazing book.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it talks about everything that
produces aroma, Nose Dive.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like 500 pages on the aromas.
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's only like 40 pages on
terpenes, but there's flavonoids and
[SPEAKER_20]: esters and phenols and volatile sulfur
compounds.
[SPEAKER_20]: And all these other things, which are
creating the aromas in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_20]: it's not only terpenes.
[SPEAKER_20]: So now we, all of a sudden we said,
we need one thing to determine cannabis.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it sativa?
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh no, that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it THC?
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh no, that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it dominant terpene?
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh no, that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_20]: Because cannabis, we always come back to
the full plant.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's always about the full plant.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's our moral compass in some ways
right there.
[SPEAKER_20]: Without the whole plant that isn't doing
what it's really capable of doing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And when Madame Canole says, let's let the
plant grow to the place where it grows
[SPEAKER_20]: wild, then we're now back into this total
conversation with nature, with our bodies,
[SPEAKER_20]: with our awareness.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the plant is talking to us like it
always has been talking to us.
[SPEAKER_20]: But the idea that THC is going to tell you
what's going to happen is a completely
[SPEAKER_20]: erroneous assumption.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really all about what the flavor is.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll throw in one more thing about
aged cannabis, vintage cannabis.
[SPEAKER_20]: People don't even want anything more than
three months old.
[SPEAKER_20]: I say, we never got anything until it was
eight months old in the past, whether it
[SPEAKER_20]: came from Mexico or Thailand.
[SPEAKER_20]: Vintage cannabis is really where it's at.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll shut up now and let everybody
else talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for saying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both Swami and Etienne, that is definitely
the new challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the challenge right now for me is
explaining to everybody that it's not just
[SPEAKER_03]: about these high THC percentages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's about the broad spectrums of
beautiful cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you have more of that,
I prefer something with a higher terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: and lower THC, even different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you smoke something almost wild,
I remember when I was smoking Thai stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: from Thailand, I felt this overall
well-being-ness, like elated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I came here, I was just high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just super high, beyond high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that due to selective rating,
we've bred towards those high THC
[SPEAKER_03]: percentages.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really shot ourselves in the foot,
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a lot of work to do to make up
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of my challenge,
as what Frenchie passed down to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: is this next challenge of educating the
generations under me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that is my job now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is my generation's job,
is to make sure that we're leaving behind
[SPEAKER_03]: we're first getting a consensus on the
language that we are using, the vocabulary
[SPEAKER_03]: that we are using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then second, to really educate,
like you guys are saying, educate
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody on the beautiful, the totality
of the beauty of this plant and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids and all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was talking to Derek from the Gange
Air program.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a lovely dinner just a couple of
weeks back on Valentine, near Valentine's
[SPEAKER_03]: Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was asking him, you know,
Frenchie, in order to get people to really
[SPEAKER_03]: understand and to get people to love it,
one thing he taught me was you have to get
[SPEAKER_03]: people to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, baby, that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoke people out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoke them out all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is what we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoke people out and you can just see
their eyes light up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could just see the, oh my God,
you know, just the like, yes, it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and boom, you know, they were just
experienced something they never
[SPEAKER_03]: experienced before time and time and time
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is one of the most profound ways
that I found that, that really edgy,
[SPEAKER_03]: that can really share it even,
even to people who don't smoke,
[SPEAKER_03]: they can, they can look at it and
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my challenge is, is they took that
away from us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took that opportunity away from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was asking Derek, Derek, what is it
going to take?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how do we bring that back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we were chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, you know, everyone had their rigs out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally, totally get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, what happened all of a sudden,
all of a sudden it's legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, now everybody can't be smoking all
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what, what changed, you know,
taxes, money, you know, it all comes down
[SPEAKER_03]: to that every single time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Derek's point was he said something
profound that really stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said that it comes down to,
it comes down to, to change, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to the low, to the small groups and
getting a consensus amongst a lot of small
[SPEAKER_03]: groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then those small groups become big groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the attention of your small local
government.
[SPEAKER_03]: You change things in your town.
[SPEAKER_03]: You change things in your little city.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you change things in your county
and the more counties that jump on board,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you change things in your state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then your state changes and then other
states start to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have so much work ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little overwhelming to be quite
honest, but I, that's where I'm at is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is coming back to sharing this together,
smoking this together.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something about being in a circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason why a hook is passed in a
circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a reason why Shillam is
passed in a circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: A circle is a continuous flow of energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a continuous flow of, of
communication, you know, and, and it
[SPEAKER_03]: brings us back together and, and,
and together looking at each other,
[SPEAKER_03]: being in that present moment together,
rather than our phones, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: away, you know, smoking together is,
you know, it's, it's, it's probably some
[SPEAKER_03]: of my closest friends in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to bring that back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of my challenge right now
is bringing that back and educating people
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and, and really sharing the beauty of
it's not just about these high THC
[SPEAKER_03]: percentages, not about it being clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I welcome, I welcome ideas,
you know, how, how are you going to bring
[SPEAKER_03]: the smoking back guys?
Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Belle, that's, I mean, you're,
that's everything you're saying is so
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what, what, you know, as a farmer
and, and first of all, I just like to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, acknowledge that, that,
that you and Frenchy and Lena and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there, we hear so much about,
you know, it all comes from the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to take that back and say
that it really all does come from the
[SPEAKER_01]: land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's, it's the soil,
it's the fungus, it's the, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes, it's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the place, the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause honestly, I, I get, I, I'm really,
I, I like to have humility about that
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's like, as farmers,
if we're doing what we should be doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just really providing the space for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: To interact with the place and the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but to what you're saying,
this is what legalization has done is
[SPEAKER_01]: completely disassociated the consumers
with, with that and with that connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's just really bad policy and
there's so much work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we, and, and this is something
that origins council has really taken a
[SPEAKER_01]: lead on and working to, you know,
there's, you know, we, we are not able to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're not able to bring, we're
literally prohibited from bringing people
[SPEAKER_01]: to our farms and smoking them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that is against the law, which is
just absolutely absurd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the big work that we need to
do is change the way that this
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization is so that we can have
smoking circles and have events that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's talk about farmers
market events, but so far, what we have in
[SPEAKER_01]: California, there is no such thing as a
real farmers market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's, it's a, it's a fake
farmers market because the farmers market
[SPEAKER_01]: is where you as the farmer have your
product on the table and you can share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like at a, at a actual vegetable
farmers market, you can cut up an apple
[SPEAKER_01]: and give somebody a slice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're right there talking to
you and it's coming from your hand and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can tell them about where you grew it and
what was special about that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that is lacking right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not, it's not lacking because I
don't believe that it's lacking because
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody forgot to put that in regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like the way of the corporate
world is to intentionally remove the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer from that connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's, it's daunting and
overwhelming, but we have to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: faith and educate and, and, you know,
dragon fly with the work you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the education.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, there's so much more work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm all ideas too, but you know,
it, it's a bummer that as farmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that we have to become so engaged
in policy and this stuff that really is
[SPEAKER_01]: not where we want to be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we don't, nobody else is doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just going to, you know,
this problem will continue to compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I see in the chat, you know,
we've got conversations happening
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally and, and with legalization
and it's all, it's, there's a part of me
[SPEAKER_01]: that's so scared of us federal
legalization, because it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just going to keep fucking it up
worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to, we have to stay super
engaged and, and that is hard work for a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of farmers and hash makers,
but we're the only ones really preaching
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, keep it up everybody.
[SPEAKER_22]: It feels to me sometime like this is like
greater than just us as a community.
[SPEAKER_22]: This is something that's so deep because
our shared connection to the plant goes
[SPEAKER_22]: back to the point before we were even a
thought in consciousness, you know,
[SPEAKER_22]: that ha having humans develop with an
endocannabinoid system with a plant that
[SPEAKER_22]: existed 26 million years before we did,
you know, there's something that just,
[SPEAKER_22]: it would be wrong to not fight for this
and for this understanding that it,
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, that the plant is encouraging
community and human connection.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't know conversation because
without that, you know, the way forward,
[SPEAKER_22]: this kind of militaristic model that we
find ourselves in is not viable.
[SPEAKER_22]: And we see that it's not taking us to a
place of overall, overall well-being
[SPEAKER_22]: that's like Belle mentioned before,
that was one of Frenchy's favorite words
[SPEAKER_22]: of describing his experience of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_22]: If it wasn't making you feel overall in a
really good place, then, then something
[SPEAKER_22]: was not right with it.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think also the hookah, that multi-host
hookah, we were in Denver once at an event
[SPEAKER_22]: and I was standing next to a guy.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was the first time he had ever smoked
the hookah and he turned to me and he
[SPEAKER_22]: said, this is like sharing a lung with
four people, you know, that he was smoking
[SPEAKER_22]: with at the same time.
[SPEAKER_22]: That it was just such a profound
experience for him.
[SPEAKER_22]: And maybe that's more of what we need is
those opportunities to get together and
[SPEAKER_22]: pass the smoke and have conversations like
we're doing now because that grounds us in
[SPEAKER_22]: community.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's, I just think it's an important
pass forward.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's part of why I advocate for you all
so much.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we, we, we, all of us are the
entourage effect and human form that are
[SPEAKER_19]: here to heal humanity.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's interesting how that biodiverse
effect just continues to show itself in
[SPEAKER_19]: our soils, in humanity, in the medicine.
[SPEAKER_19]: And honestly, you know, that's part of our
big mission out here that we're,
[SPEAKER_19]: we're using Frenchy and this, this,
this spirit to embody change.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have Alice here from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead and say something.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love you all so much.
[SPEAKER_17]: Much love to all of you and to Frenchy,
which was the key to bring education to
[SPEAKER_17]: all of us.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think if there's something that sums up
his work, it's the way he educated people
[SPEAKER_17]: and the way he multiplied education and
the way he never held information behind.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he just wanted to share so we could
multiply and we could all smoke more,
[SPEAKER_17]: no more, and actually be a real part of
the hash history.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not only about the past, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's what we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there is time to change and we all stay
together and keep together like Frenchy
[SPEAKER_17]: always said for us to be and brought
everyone together, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: He brought all these amazing people.
[SPEAKER_17]: Belle, I love you so much.
[SPEAKER_17]: Frenchy brought me you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Lena, Kim, like, I love you all so much
and thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing I just wanted to say is
that we're all talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: continuing to push forward legalization in
a way that helps the farmer, helps the
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one way that really helps cannabis is
to continue to push forward home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That all of the education that we're doing
is that cannabis is in every single
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That apartment complexes have small little
cannabis gardens that have some tomatoes
[SPEAKER_02]: and some zucchini that's growing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's community gardens that people are
utilizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we continue to bring that education
forward, through federal legalization,
[SPEAKER_02]: we know that it's going to get fucked up
for the farmers, for even the consumers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're going to be able to have the
capability to consume our own flour,
[SPEAKER_02]: to consume our own concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we are doing that and we are
pushing the education forward,
[SPEAKER_02]: then people are truly being healed by
getting down in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're breathing the soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That right there is going to help them
create better decisions for the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the plant that they're going to
grow is going to be in communication with
[SPEAKER_02]: that person the entire time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's DNA that's swapped.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's frequency that's swapped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really believe that the best
medicine in the world is the one that you
[SPEAKER_02]: grow yourself.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, you know, making your own
nutrients and making your own soil and
[SPEAKER_19]: really using your environment is the
ultimate way to create terroir and
[SPEAKER_19]: Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Frenchy really agreed with that,
that just having a pot and soil that's
[SPEAKER_19]: bought at the store and using vital
nutrients, it will never give you any type
[SPEAKER_19]: of unique flavor or terroir or anything
for your area.
[SPEAKER_19]: So really a big part of the mission that
we are all on is teaching people how to
[SPEAKER_19]: make their own nutrients, teaching people
how to make their own soil, teaching home
[SPEAKER_19]: growers how to make their own sift.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the way we engage with our power
and how we use cannabis as the opportunity
[SPEAKER_19]: that it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cannabis could be treated industrial and
more like a prisoner, or it could be
[SPEAKER_19]: treated more freely like a gift to us.
[SPEAKER_19]: We could make clothes and oil and food and
medicine.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to encourage us to continue
that nature aspect of creating the
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis and as legalization it can be
done indoors in a way where there's
[SPEAKER_19]: regenerative style techniques used.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, that's important.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's best outdoors, but if you're doing it
indoors, you can still do it by using
[SPEAKER_19]: local environmental inputs for your farm.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to jump in for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been saying much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been listening a lot and I really
appreciate the beauty of this
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the reasons that I feel
compelled to speak is that we meet because
[SPEAKER_04]: of Frenchie and his work and Madame Gnoli,
the way you have gotten this film to the
[SPEAKER_04]: attention of so many folk is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it struck me to say that we have the
Dragonfly Earth Medicine family
[SPEAKER_04]: representing ideal, in my opinion,
practices towards creating the best
[SPEAKER_04]: versions of the cannabis plant in terms of
the health and vitality of the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a medicine maker and other medicine
makers know, you get the best medicine,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever medicine means to you,
from the cannabis plant, from the best
[SPEAKER_04]: farms, the best cultivation practices
produce the best medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can make medicine from mediocre
product, but it's not going to be what it
[SPEAKER_04]: could have been.
[SPEAKER_04]: And stewardship to the earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a respect for the earth and the
importance of the fungal kingdoms and the
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity that comes in a regenerative
garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so deep respect for that, if you will,
for the roots of this conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And meantime, it is Hash Church,
so we are all about concentrating the
[SPEAKER_04]: results of that work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, mad respect for the folk
who, I mean, I'm sitting in the office
[SPEAKER_04]: spaces of a local hash maker doing dry
sift, little commercial quick,
[SPEAKER_04]: floressee, long time, floressee has been
doing the work in with awareness of CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: oil and the needs of patients long enough
that Harry, the owner and friend,
[SPEAKER_04]: at one time created and owned the domain
name CBD oil dot com, which was a while
[SPEAKER_04]: ago, and he sold it years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's how long he's been doing
it as long as I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's he's a longtime resident up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And meantime, my friends, we leave Joe's
drop by.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to finish through the cycle here of
of my thoughts on this conversation today,
[SPEAKER_04]: because not only do we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful cultivators, respect to the
planet, best product made for the
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturers to turn that into a product
that's suitable for use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people like Dr. Mark keeping track of
what's going on with the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_04]: processes and ensuring best results again
for the end user.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's on us at some point to educate
the public about why THC numbers are such
[SPEAKER_04]: a terrible way of finding best product for
your own needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and the last part of my mad ramble,
I'm almost done, I promise, is there's
[SPEAKER_04]: also this component represented on the
professional level by Etienne and his work
[SPEAKER_04]: at Berkeley Patients Group.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I saw that Alex Dixon might join
our group today, but I've run into him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on the board with Valerie Corral down
in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, sweetly, Joe and myself have
for years been about making sure those who
[SPEAKER_04]: really need cannabis, if you will,
the very end of the supply chain being
[SPEAKER_04]: discussed here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the beauty of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the bases covered, if you will,
and I think the one hole in it is we
[SPEAKER_04]: really do have to help the consumer,
particularly folks who are new to
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, to understand that cannabis has
so many different properties, so many
[SPEAKER_04]: different possibilities, and a lot of it
is based on what is your body need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deep gratitude for the gathering today and
deep gratitude, Frenchy, for calling upon
[SPEAKER_04]: us to respect the generations going back,
you know, as been said, thousands of years
[SPEAKER_04]: and not all of the changes that have
happened have been to the best of the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis plant itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: At one point, I thought that our focus on
THC had created an imbalanced,
[SPEAKER_04]: overloaded branch of the possibilities
that the cannabis plan represents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of skunk man Sam had been able
to join us today, he would call me out
[SPEAKER_04]: bullshit on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will stop there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like to give Joe a chance to
say hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do have to observe that it has
snowed a couple of times down here in
[SPEAKER_04]: town.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I live 800 feet in elevation higher
than where I'm sitting at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in respect to my well-being and my
wife's very strong, respectful,
[SPEAKER_04]: love-filled request, I might have to step
out early.
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Sweetleaf Joe, the founder and
director of the Sweetleaf Collective.
[SPEAKER_09]: We help low income terminally ill
patients, veterans, people of color,
[SPEAKER_09]: the LGBTQ community, seniors.
[SPEAKER_09]: We basically all underserved demographics.
[SPEAKER_09]: We help access free medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've been doing this since 1996.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're California's oldest cannabis brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, just wanted to come and check
this out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wade invited me today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like also what Wade was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is important to protect small business
and the cultivators and all of the
[SPEAKER_09]: strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the other part of the picture is
protecting access to those who can't
[SPEAKER_09]: afford it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because as we saw in 2019, when compassion
programs, health equity, and cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: nonprofits shut down in California due to
taxation, people died.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is a human cost when people do
not have access to free medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they cannot afford it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's my little feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll just lean in and say,
I first ran into Joe's work back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was very, very just beginning my
professional work with cannabis myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was doing volunteer work for a group
called the Shanti Project, who was all
[SPEAKER_04]: about helping people dying.
[SPEAKER_04]: People dying of AIDS.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I first met Joe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can probably tell I had a number
of friends who were doing the same,
[SPEAKER_04]: who were dying from AIDS.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my thing was providing emotional
support and caregiving.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's real deal, people.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's important work.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for being also the leaders.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you're three years older than BPG.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're 23 years old.
[SPEAKER_12]: And people are like, oh, that's crazy for
a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like, well, we learn from the
collectives.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're one of the original
collectives.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to give a shout out to not only
one of the oldest, but one of the most
[SPEAKER_12]: enduring.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we continue to support.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll always continue to support
those.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm a patient myself as a veteran.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that saved my life.
[SPEAKER_12]: And unfortunately, a lot of these
dispensary owners nowadays aren't patients
[SPEAKER_12]: and don't understand the reality.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or the responsibility that we carry to do
things right and responsible, which is why
[SPEAKER_12]: we've worked with people who are doing it
right, who are doing it with integrity,
[SPEAKER_12]: like Frenchie, like Joe, like Wade,
and others who are there to not only do it
[SPEAKER_12]: right, but to take the time to educate you
on why it should be done right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And not only to explain it by living as an
example day in and day out, waking up
[SPEAKER_12]: tomorrow and getting up and doing it
again, planning today for tomorrow so that
[SPEAKER_12]: that hash or that cannabis is ready so
that that patient, because that patient is
[SPEAKER_12]: coming tomorrow for that cannabis,
expecting that cannabis for them.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Joe's right.
[SPEAKER_12]: People died, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we had to fight within our own state
to have compassionate giving.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're going to have to fight again.
[SPEAKER_12]: And band together again here in another
year to go lobby to change the law again
[SPEAKER_12]: so that we can continue to give free
cannabis to those that are in need.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is something the other states
have to realize.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope the audit that's about to
happen in Canada, since you're coming up
[SPEAKER_12]: on your five years there, that
compassionate giving and medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: can stand the test of time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's now legal since December of
2020.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm working with the group,
the Veterans Action Council will actually
[SPEAKER_12]: be in Vienna.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have representatives and we have
another site event at the 66 C&D where
[SPEAKER_12]: we're working toward legalization for
adult use by 2029.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we believe that's a possibility so
that no one will be executed around the
[SPEAKER_12]: world for cannabis ever again.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're at the local, state, federal and
we're at the international level.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when the galactic level decides to
call us up, we'll be there and ready to
[SPEAKER_12]: push cannabis into the galaxy further.
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, humbled and honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you, of course, Sweet Leaf Joe
for your decades of leadership and humble
[SPEAKER_12]: ability to navigate the very difficult
waters that it takes to get the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_12]: to get it to people for free.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the logistics that go in between,
nothing but mad respect and love.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just made me realize, 18, there is a
milestone to be had.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who will be the first person to smoke hash
in space?
[SPEAKER_12]: Who will be that person and who will grow
that hash?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Kimberly, as you know, sometimes
they bring me in on Hash Church to break
[SPEAKER_05]: down all the science that happens in hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have this unfortunate thing about
needing to know the percent THC in a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: material that produces all this other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it produces THC, produces THCA
actually, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we smoke it, it converts it to
THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the difficulty about taking a
botanical and quantifying the amount of an
[SPEAKER_05]: active ingredient on there is that the
botanical itself has a lot of moisture
[SPEAKER_05]: content.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in order to provide an accurate
assessment, the standardization is usually
[SPEAKER_05]: to report the amount of a chemical
substance in a plant based on dried
[SPEAKER_05]: weight, based on the dry weight of the
plant material.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been completely dried.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the challenge at the laboratories is,
well, the cannabis they're getting is not
[SPEAKER_05]: dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have to dry it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you dry something, you're going to
put it in a vacuum and you're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: heat it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, gee, what happens to cannabis when
you heat it up, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the volatilization of the terpenes
and as well as the loss of the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's even known now that some of
these labs, because they're trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: crank through as many samples as they can,
one of the knobs that they can turn in
[SPEAKER_05]: here is they turn up the temperature,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That way they can process more samples,
because the more samples the lab
[SPEAKER_05]: processes, the more money the lab makes,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they turn up the heat,
guess what happens to the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: acids?
[SPEAKER_05]: They decarboxylate, turn into THC,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So now what you're putting into the HPLC
to measure the cannabinoid content on is
[SPEAKER_05]: not only been dried, but it's been
deterping, it's been decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's difficult when each individual
lab has a different SOP that's doing this
[SPEAKER_05]: process, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the difficulty has always been
the reproducibility between labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's lawsuits in states where
producers do this THC inflation to be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to get their stuff into the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And AT&T knows when there's wholesale
exchanges, you know, what's the metric?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it looks good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hell, I was talking to a guy who is
in Washington Square Park, bought
[SPEAKER_05]: something in New York City that thought it
looked good, didn't get him high at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably just sprayed hemp,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's buying it from a weed truck where
there used to be food trucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's weed trucks in New York City.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a metric that's not the right thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were talking about this,
Marcus, with Jeremy and that group that
[SPEAKER_05]: came out with that paper, The Nose Knows,
which I think is one of the most
[SPEAKER_05]: fascinating papers that I've read in the
open cannabis literature, which again,
[SPEAKER_05]: puts the emphasis not on THC content and
not typically on like terpene content.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can't look at one terpene as one
instrument in this orchestra, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're listening to this orchestra play
this beautiful music and you can't just
[SPEAKER_05]: isolate one terpene and say, wow,
it's karyophyllene.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need a karyophyllene dominant or
limonene.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the way that they play this music
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are just the terpenes that we
can see or the ones that are analyzed in
[SPEAKER_05]: the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole host of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as was graciously pointed out earlier,
non-terpenoid molecules like the sulfur
[SPEAKER_05]: containing molecules, Marcus, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We had these discussions about these new
volatile.
[SPEAKER_05]: As it turns out, those thiols are actually
sulfur compounds, but they're preenlated
[SPEAKER_05]: sulfide.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are derived from isoprene.
[SPEAKER_05]: So essentially they are thiolated or
sulfur containing compounds, but they're
[SPEAKER_05]: starting material, could you not?
[SPEAKER_05]: Isoprene, which is the same starting
material that all terpenes are derived
[SPEAKER_05]: from.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll stop by just saying it is so
difficult in this age of prohibition
[SPEAKER_05]: ending and commercial production happening
without having some sort of metric.
[SPEAKER_05]: And until we figure out this issue about
how to standardize, there are
[SPEAKER_05]: standardization methods, but when you take
a wet cannabis flower, so everything that
[SPEAKER_05]: we smoke in our pipe or everything that we
would make hash out of, it's not on a
[SPEAKER_05]: dried weight basis, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you convert that sample in a
laboratory to a dried weight basis,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've just not only lost all your water,
you've lost all your terpenes,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've lost all your aldehydes,
thiols, all these other compounds that we
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know about, and you've
decarboxylated your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you're putting into your HPL
machine is no representation of what
[SPEAKER_05]: you're buying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark, let me bud in for once.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, there's our friend.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to mention that you can
bring your moisture level down to
[SPEAKER_15]: practically zero with the desiccator.
[SPEAKER_15]: So without heat, no heat at all.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that preserves the majority of the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem with that though, Sam,
is, and you bring up a really great point,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a couple of presentations out on
the internet by a researcher named Ginny
[SPEAKER_05]: Curry, G-I-N-I-C-U-R-R-Y.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's an analytical chemist who works
at a testing lab, who's given a couple of
[SPEAKER_05]: presentations on this recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're absolutely right, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is, is that if you're going to
do desiccation, it takes overnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overnight, that lab is not making enough
money to run those samples.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe if you have a hundred desiccators,
you might want to continue to do that.
Right?
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's where the problem with
this is because we used a glass one that
[SPEAKER_15]: held about, I don't know, maybe 50 grams
maximum.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it took at least one day to... because
we were storing it at maybe, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_15]: eight, 10% moisture.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you still had to get rid of the rest of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's fair to say though, Sam,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That if you're desiccating and you're
removing some of the moisture,
[SPEAKER_05]: you aren't probably gonna be losing some
of your most volatile compounds in that
[SPEAKER_05]: loss.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It depends on the room temperature is.
[SPEAKER_15]: If the room temperature is fairly low,
then no, that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_15]: But also I wanted to mention that the
thiols, I'm doing some tests now,
[SPEAKER_15]: some pure THC-A, and I'll be using some of
the thiols that were given to me to test
[SPEAKER_15]: to see if they can either modulate or
potentially THC the way some of the
[SPEAKER_15]: terpenes can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they will.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure, but I'm curious as hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I love the garlicky essence of some
of the hazes, and I think that there is
[SPEAKER_05]: something to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beyond the gas essence, but those guys
actually have developed the gas scale
[SPEAKER_05]: based on some of the volatile sulfides
that they've identified.
[SPEAKER_15]: The one that I got is the one that they
suspect is the most likely, and also that
[SPEAKER_15]: is the most potent.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're talking about the tiniest amount on
a pinhead.
[SPEAKER_15]: It can stink up the whole room for days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how is your wife loving that,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I haven't taken it out yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I do it, I'll do it out on my
balcony.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, welcome to our celebration of
Frenchy Gunsman Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been too long.
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just meditating on my puff go,
and I spaced it out the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: On your puff go or your Magna Carta?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm not using my Magna Carta yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have it in my hands.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm using the puff go, and I'll try to
make the Carta as soon as I get one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is somebody talking?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were telling stories about Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any stories about Frenchy,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Frenchy and I had a very,
very close relationship.
[SPEAKER_15]: He wanted to use more science to prove the
various theories and feelings he had about
[SPEAKER_15]: hashish.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I encouraged him in every way that I
could to do so.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think right at the time he died,
he had done some recent work where they
[SPEAKER_15]: were taking hashish and then pressing it,
rubbing it, and storing it for three
[SPEAKER_15]: months, six months, nine months to see
what happens to the cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_15]: terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because he had a lot of feelings that new
terpenes were created or there was
[SPEAKER_15]: something going on.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wasn't so sure about the new
terpenes, but I said the way to answer the
[SPEAKER_15]: questions is with science.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it took him a couple of years to
get together, but he was doing it right
[SPEAKER_15]: when, unfortunately, he left us.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that was studies that he did with
High North Labs in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was just the initial study to kind
of establish the prototype and figure out
[SPEAKER_22]: the protocol, sorry, how to do the longer
term study.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so that's something that I hope to
fund in the future as well, because
[SPEAKER_22]: Frenchy had the experience, you know,
one of the things they would do when they
[SPEAKER_22]: would go back year after year in the
mountains with the Italians that were up
[SPEAKER_22]: there with him, because it was just a
couple of French people and some Italians
[SPEAKER_22]: back in the day that really went to the
areas that he was at.
[SPEAKER_22]: Before they would go down to Goa for the
winter, you know, when the snow would hit
[SPEAKER_22]: up there, they would leave a little bit of
the charus that they had made that year.
[SPEAKER_22]: They would bury it underground so that
they would have something to smoke as soon
[SPEAKER_22]: as they came back up.
[SPEAKER_22]: And they would have these little get
togethers.
[SPEAKER_22]: And over the years, you know, once he had
been doing this for five, six years,
[SPEAKER_22]: there were Italians that had been there 10
years before him.
[SPEAKER_22]: He started smoking hash that was eight,
10, 12 years old and really had this,
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, kind of amazing experience of
how good this aged charus, I should say it
[SPEAKER_22]: was charus was.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that kind of planted the seed in his
brain of there was this whole area in the
[SPEAKER_22]: commercial marketplace that was still open
for development around aging hashish.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think being French and having the
experience, you know, the culture there
[SPEAKER_22]: with aging wine or certain alcohols that
are that are aged and develop a different
[SPEAKER_22]: profile and expression with the passage of
time.
[SPEAKER_22]: That was something that was really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, interesting to him.
[SPEAKER_22]: And of course, he loved talking with all
of you who have the scientific background
[SPEAKER_22]: because he really felt that the ancestors,
they intuitively knew something because of
[SPEAKER_22]: what they had learned generation after
generation.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, working with people,
he would ask them in those traditional
[SPEAKER_22]: cultures, why do we do this thing?
[SPEAKER_22]: And the answer was always because it makes
a better hashish, because it makes a
[SPEAKER_22]: better charus.
[SPEAKER_22]: They couldn't explain the science,
but they knew what they knew because they
[SPEAKER_22]: had paid attention to the plant and their
parents or their grandparents had passed
[SPEAKER_22]: the knowledge on.
[SPEAKER_22]: And he really wanted to be able to
validate their understanding through
[SPEAKER_22]: modern science and and leave that with the
world.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm in favor of cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_15]: That has been my life.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I encourage him in every way I could
to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: We both had a deep, deep love of hashish.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had very slight different feelings.
[SPEAKER_15]: For example, I and I think Marcus also
likes this prefer unpressed dry sifted
[SPEAKER_15]: resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just something about it that I
like a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_15]: But for any sort of longtime preservation,
I would strongly recommend pressing it
[SPEAKER_15]: like like.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody else around me does.
[SPEAKER_22]: I just like to say, too, you know,
the other thing that Frenchie used to
[SPEAKER_22]: comment on a lot was how hard we are like
one person's preference to another,
[SPEAKER_22]: sometimes within the concentrate
community.
[SPEAKER_22]: And he used to say, you know, it's so
funny.
[SPEAKER_22]: You never hear a tequila drinker trashing
a cognac consumer for their choice.
[SPEAKER_22]: And he would be the first person to say,
you know, that's whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_22]: consume.
[SPEAKER_22]: If you should consume what makes you feel
good and what meets your needs and your
[SPEAKER_22]: preferences, but that there shouldn't be
this judgment against another person
[SPEAKER_22]: because they want, you know.
[SPEAKER_22]: So in the case of Frenchie, he loved the
traditional press and even aged hashish.
[SPEAKER_22]: He wasn't going to say that he didn't
think you should not.
[SPEAKER_22]: Smoke your unpressed, loose, live resin by
any means.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, so I just would like to throw
out.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we need more tolerance.
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be what I was talking about
actually wasn't live resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's dried plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been dried for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been cured for a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you dry sift it and then you smoke it
as unpressed pollen.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a very slight difference,
but it's different.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_15]: Different smokes for different folks.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever turns your crank is what's good
for you.
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as it's clean and safe for the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you let 1000 ideas bloom.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just in the spirit of aged resin,
we have a traditional ball here that mean
[SPEAKER_19]: gene gave to us and it's nine years old.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got to be, I don't know, maybe if
mean genes out there, you can say exactly
[SPEAKER_19]: how old it was, but it's probably over
nine years now.
[SPEAKER_19]: We did add some other stuff in it there,
but it's very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been smoking snakes out of it and
into the joints right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we all really love smoking hashish
like this.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it water hash dry sifted?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know water hash water hash?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it would have been nice if you could
have analyzed it nine years ago and every
[SPEAKER_15]: five years or so along this trail.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very curious about that.
[SPEAKER_19]: We would like to do that as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have some pre COVID hash also from a
2019 Mendo breath, which is kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, we can give that a test.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you have some, we can talk to high
North cause we work with high North out in
[SPEAKER_19]: Ontario from our British Columbian farm.
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe we can do some of that testing.
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be fun to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to keep it, you know,
in a cool dry place in a good container
[SPEAKER_19]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know when I did storage studies in my
laboratory years ago, when I was busy
[SPEAKER_15]: working, I found that cannabis after one
or two years of just storage in boxes in
[SPEAKER_15]: the dark and cool room, lost the majority
of its terpenes, but its cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_15]: profile was still identical.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas the dry sifted resin also it loses
the majority of its terpenes and it'll
[SPEAKER_15]: start to turn from like a golden sand
colored to almost reddish color just from
[SPEAKER_15]: the oxidation of the THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got some red hash right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually that I can show it real quick
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a different view.
[SPEAKER_07]: This piece of hash is 13 years old that's
in here.
[SPEAKER_12]: The person that I know would do that is
Kenny from Tricome technology.
[SPEAKER_12]: He would whip out, I mean, literally 15,
20 different varieties, two years old,
[SPEAKER_12]: just to show you the difference in the
flavors, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's definitely, yeah, it's
definitely for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely couch lock kind of hash
for sure, but definitely you can tell the
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenes, all that were definitely gone.
[SPEAKER_12]: You really had to get in there to get any
type of flavor and the flavor really
[SPEAKER_12]: didn't come out until it was actually lit.
[SPEAKER_12]: So not many people I know in America will
actually age hash, but not many people I
[SPEAKER_12]: know would do that many hashes that many
years that he likes to do, but to also
[SPEAKER_12]: like Sam, what he was doing to see the
differences and what the changes that
[SPEAKER_12]: transpire happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, it's...
[SPEAKER_12]: Couch lock.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can only cure for so long,
although this particular hash,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is almost 14 years old now,
it still has an incredible flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has almost no smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: It smells almost stale, which is like what
I've seen from resin that's in the almost
[SPEAKER_08]: 15 to 20 year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam used to have some really old resin as
did one of his partners.
[SPEAKER_08]: He wasn't necessarily curing it as much as
preserving it, but it was still very old.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was at minus 30 centigrade and I
sucked all the oxygen away from it for
[SPEAKER_15]: long-term storage and then it kept and the
terpenes were kept.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything was really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you're not super careful about your
long-term storage of dry sifted resin,
[SPEAKER_15]: for example, then yeah, it definitely
changes.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a point of diminishing returns.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did Frenchie freeze his once he's pressed
and he wanted to keep it for a few years,
[SPEAKER_15]: would he freeze it or store it at room
temperature?
[SPEAKER_22]: He would store it in the basement almost
like a wine cellar because he was
[SPEAKER_22]: interested in the transformation,
what was happening with the terpenes and
[SPEAKER_22]: whatnot over time.
[SPEAKER_22]: But in the study that he wanted to do,
like you have done, he wanted to have some
[SPEAKER_22]: that was stored at very, very cold
conditions and then three different
[SPEAKER_22]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's exactly what you need to do for
science.
[SPEAKER_16]: Lebanon was notorious for producing red
hashish, but to my knowledge, they're no
[SPEAKER_16]: longer producing red hash today,
but I believe their drying methodologies
[SPEAKER_16]: are the same.
[SPEAKER_16]: What's different now?
[SPEAKER_12]: It had soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was able to get Lebanese when I was in
Saudi Arabia for the Gulf War.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was able to trade with the South and I
got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a little dry and brittle.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was compact.
[SPEAKER_12]: It would come in long, thin slats.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it was just red and it didn't have a
right flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But from what I'm told, that's just from
the dust of the soil.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely red.
[SPEAKER_15]: Soil makes Lebanese red.
[SPEAKER_15]: It may not be the only reason,
but it's the majority of the reason.
[SPEAKER_13]: Iron silicate.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think part of the problem with the
Lebanon is that it's just become extremely
[SPEAKER_19]: punishable there.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were just talking with a cannabis man
from Lebanon at a coffee shop in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_19]: and they come out here because anything
they do there is just really hard to get
[SPEAKER_19]: around in Lebanon right now, especially
after the bomb and that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And even this is Mick back here from GWA.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's saying that a lot of the traditional
hash that's going around here,
[SPEAKER_19]: 95% of it's coming from Morocco at this
moment.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's what's flooding Europe is
Morocco.
[SPEAKER_15]: And most of it is about the best you can
get is zero zero, which they take a
[SPEAKER_15]: hundred kilos of dried plants and they
make at least two kilos of elected resin
[SPEAKER_15]: from it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know because I tried that double
zero that you gave to Ed at Positronix
[SPEAKER_12]: back in 96.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was the first and only time I
ever had that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you snapped it, you used a knife
and it clicked just like glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember that sound and I remember
smoking that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was lights out some of the most
amazing hash I've ever, ever had.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's because it was anywhere from 70%
resin heads to higher.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember that particular piece,
but you know, when I made it for gifts,
[SPEAKER_15]: it was usually, you know, 70, 80% resin
heads.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember being laying on and I went
around and did all the different hash
[SPEAKER_12]: places in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just remember laying on the bench
there at Positronix staring at the sky.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, when I left, I had just one little
gram left and I ate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I remember landing in New York and
trying to walk toward the customs guy and
[SPEAKER_12]: everything was in slow motion.
[SPEAKER_12]: My wife said I was fine.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I was fucking lit out of my fucking
mind.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how I made it through there,
but you know, the universe was kind to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, it was, yeah, still without a
doubt, one of those memories that stick in
[SPEAKER_12]: my mind.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's due to you and due to real
double zero.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had conversations with Frenchy about
going on a tour in Kimberley in Morocco
[SPEAKER_19]: and visiting farms because he was saying
that a lot of the farms there were just
[SPEAKER_19]: not growing in a way that he thinks is the
best for the resin.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that he felt like the local
cultivation could be, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: done better for their local cultivation.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, they use the beaten sift
technique there.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's also like interesting to see
how the beaten sift technique that's come
[SPEAKER_19]: into like bags here in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can get beaten sift bags, you know,
and make hash the Moroccan way.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it is, it's less tense, but you can
still make really beautiful, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: kind of patties or big pressed hash,
which is beautiful to smoke in ganja,
[SPEAKER_19]: dubies, or tobacco, which a lot of people
do here.
[SPEAKER_19]: But the beaten sift technique is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't see it as much at home because
the pure resin heads are better for
[SPEAKER_19]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it doesn't make sense to have a 70%
heads, but the terpene ratio on it is in a
[SPEAKER_19]: way a lot higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I was thinking Josh just
mentioned Morocco.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was definitely something that Frenchy
and we were dreaming about because he
[SPEAKER_02]: would talk about Morocco and sort of get
stars in his eyes and say, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: we got to teach him biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to go back and reteach him.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people up in the hills who are
still doing it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that passion to bring the old world
practices and the old world techniques,
[SPEAKER_02]: even to the people who were there still,
even the people who have lost it,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was still out there teaching them their
old ways or reintroducing their old ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just really thinking about that and
dreaming about that and how that's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: my greatest dreams to get out to Morocco
because he just talked about it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I have to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, be honest.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to shout out to Marcus because it
was actually Marcus and having bubble
[SPEAKER_12]: bags, which brought an ideal to people at
the different size screens mattered.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, has literally uplifted the quality
of hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now granted, there's different people who
have knocked off what Marcus has done.
[SPEAKER_12]: But regardless, that type of understanding
that different types of flowers produce
[SPEAKER_12]: different size micron size, you know,
flowering tops.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it mattered and it still matters.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to thank Bubble Man and
the others who use that technology that
[SPEAKER_12]: has risen the quality all around,
because I know Frenchy used those bags and
[SPEAKER_12]: it was very successful in helping him get
at the quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the technology standards have also
helped raise the standards outright.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to bring back to thank
Marcus for his ingenious time and place in
[SPEAKER_12]: the hash history to move things forward,
because we wouldn't be where we are if
[SPEAKER_12]: that understanding in itself wasn't out
there for people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really matters.
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, kind of piggybacking on
what you just said about going to Morocco,
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we have we kind of owe them a debt
because we brought things these cultivars
[SPEAKER_22]: that really were not suited to the local
terroir there.
[SPEAKER_22]: And now they're needing to use more water.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're having problems with pests.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're having all kinds of issues that
they didn't have in the in the past.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think, you know, we do we do owe
them some help in in seeing that maybe
[SPEAKER_22]: they should let things go back or,
you know, use cultivars that are more
[SPEAKER_22]: adapted to the environment there and not
try to change the environment.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of like I'm seeing pictures of
people doing ice water seeding in the
[SPEAKER_22]: Himalayas, you know, where in traditional
chowras cultures in environments that are
[SPEAKER_22]: very humid and not suited to drying the
material after it's been washed.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I just would love for people in
these traditional environments to
[SPEAKER_22]: understand that just because we're doing
something in northern California in one
[SPEAKER_22]: way that suits the climate, the
environment that we have here,
[SPEAKER_22]: that it's not necessarily going to be the
perfect fit and that maybe what they have
[SPEAKER_22]: traditionally is what the world needs and
not for them to replicate what we what we
[SPEAKER_22]: have.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think we've always done the best
service by trying to replace the original
[SPEAKER_22]: genetics that were in these producing
countries.
[SPEAKER_14]: Agree, agree.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think it's beautiful to see
traditions and technology get together.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we all here and Frenchy and all
of you honor so much in tradition,
[SPEAKER_17]: but we can't deny where we live in.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: We live in the world where is I mean,
we live in the present.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Bell's work is completely uniting
also tradition and technology.
[SPEAKER_17]: Honoring the tradition and honoring the
different colors of patch, the different
[SPEAKER_17]: amounts of land matter that can be in that
mesh.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I went to Morocco eight years ago and
then now.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then in just three years, I could see
the big change in traditions of
[SPEAKER_17]: technology.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that people here in Europe probably
know way more about me than that.
[SPEAKER_17]: But for the first time, people in the
street were trying to sell things to me
[SPEAKER_17]: talking about the micro.
[SPEAKER_17]: Before eight years ago, they were not
talking about one micron that was made.
[SPEAKER_17]: They were showing me some strawberry
banana bars and a bunch of them come to
[SPEAKER_17]: come here to Barcelona, too.
[SPEAKER_17]: But they were showing all these different
kinds of genetics.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, of course, it's beautiful for us to
think of a world when it's untouched,
[SPEAKER_17]: when globalization somehow happened.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what we have nowadays.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just hope we keep honoring tradition
that we just don't.
[SPEAKER_17]: Develop just technology and forget about
the tradition.
[SPEAKER_08]: So both directions are important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Both both directions are important to keep
our roots, but to grow up towards the sun.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important to have them both.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll tell you, there were several
years where I would take we made some
[SPEAKER_08]: incredible water hash with Dr. Atomic.
[SPEAKER_08]: He brought some of his flowers over to my
house and we made some.
[SPEAKER_08]: He brought like three or four pounds of
flour when flour was worth three thousand
dollars.
[SPEAKER_08]: A pound and said, whatever, let's just
make some nice bubble hash with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I took that bubble hash to Bob
Marley's birthday bash in Kingston,
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamaica that year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he took it to Nepal for the
Shivaratri.
[SPEAKER_08]: And everyone we shared it with and
everywhere we shared it with, he actually
[SPEAKER_08]: put it on a plate at a celebration of hash
at Shivaratri in Kathmandu.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was the people's choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the Baba's choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of hash for that evening, it was the one
that no one could get over.
[SPEAKER_08]: No one could believe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, they weren't dissing their
traditional hashes, but they had just
[SPEAKER_08]: never seen anything like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was six star full melt bubble and
they were smoking it in chillums in a cave
[SPEAKER_08]: in Kathmandu.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just and a very similar
experience happened in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: I smoked it with a variety of Rastafari
from different tribes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also not only smoked it,
but we put it in the steam pipe as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was vaporized and it was it's neat
to see we couldn't have what we have today
[SPEAKER_08]: without those traditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of like by creating something
new, you're really paying homage to the
[SPEAKER_08]: tradition because you couldn't you're
you're a step in a ladder and you couldn't
[SPEAKER_08]: take that step without all the steps
before you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there's no steps after you,
well, then the ladder ends.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's that's sort of a sad thought as
well.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think one of our most important steps
recently has been, well, by recently,
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, last few decades, has been using
simsamia to produce water hash or dry
[SPEAKER_15]: sift.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, because simsamia and resin is
fundamentally fundamentally got more of
[SPEAKER_15]: what we want.
[SPEAKER_15]: And cleanliness is next to godliness.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all, folks.
[SPEAKER_19]: In the case of a Morocco, you're
definitely seeing like, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: runs and cushments and things coming over
from Morocco a lot, which is like kind of
[SPEAKER_19]: a bummer, but also maybe cool for them
because they love ganja, too.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're just exploring these new
flavors as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: There are definitely some regions where,
you know, I would imagine that the
[SPEAKER_19]: Moroccans still, you know, it's it's a
little bit more land race.
[SPEAKER_19]: But we have been talking about going on a
trip this fall to explore during the hash
[SPEAKER_19]: times, you know, to see what's what's
going on out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: You you will not find pure land races in
Morocco because all of the crops are
[SPEAKER_15]: seeded and they're seeded by the the new
multipoly hybrid imports.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the pollen is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there there are no pure land races.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody who says so, they just don't
really understand.
[SPEAKER_19]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_19]: And even this cone pot back here knows
about higher in the mountains,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, maybe is the best place that
you're going to find anything that has no
[SPEAKER_15]: trouble getting higher in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_15]: Still zero zero problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: First time I visited Morocco was 1971.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it had only been growing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Keith, because they were growing teeth
until about 65.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's when they first grew.
[SPEAKER_15]: Keith and they ground it up and made hash
out of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Before that, they were not making hash
from Morocco.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hashish is new to Morocco.
[SPEAKER_15]: Keith's smoking is hundreds of years old.
[SPEAKER_13]: And was it true that it was a Nigerian guy
who brought Lebanese screening techniques
[SPEAKER_08]: to Morocco?
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the story that was told me and Rob
from the family who was the big wazoo's in
[SPEAKER_15]: the riff.
[SPEAKER_15]: They had been growing more and longer than
anybody else.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we talked to the grandfather and he
told us it was an Algerian black guy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mustafa.
[SPEAKER_15]: Who brought the method from Algeria.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't know if Algeria was ever a big
producer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe he had seen it in Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_15]: That I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: But these people were serious,
serious when we were we were introduced to
[SPEAKER_15]: the younger parts of their family and they
were helping us do some work there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And but before they would work with us,
they wanted the grandfather to meet us and
[SPEAKER_15]: we had to meet him and we had to be
approved.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we walked into their their home
above the front door, there was a big
[SPEAKER_15]: giant male plant wrapped into a circle and
hung there like in a Christmas wreath.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, that's the other way to do it is with
your hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't mean to interrupt you,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that Charis in the making?
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Milano Valley.
[SPEAKER_19]: Our friend Kush Kirk in southern Oregon
has dedicated a few plants completely to
[SPEAKER_19]: making Charis the last couple of years,
and it's been really awesome and it's a
[SPEAKER_19]: fun project and he's inspired other people
to do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that's really.
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you ever checked out what the yield
is?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or does he do it from living plants or
does he do it from dry plants?
[SPEAKER_19]: From living just like normal, like he does
it from living plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can, you know, ask him exactly
what his yields are.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're really good.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, they're way better than the
other, you know, doing it in the Himalayas
[SPEAKER_19]: or whatnot, because the plants are have
larger crystals, you know, bigger crystals
[SPEAKER_19]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a beautiful hash and it's traditional
and it's Charis.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's different.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is what I got to jump in here
for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I want to thank the folks that made
it possible for me to come into town,
[SPEAKER_04]: Floresy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some Tropicana cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sam, you might approve.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is this was harvested from this
summer's outdoor, done right,
[SPEAKER_04]: regenerative, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Tiger's Sky Tiger Ranch here in
Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it's dry sift done cold,
lightly pressed to make a yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: a nice little package.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know if you can see what's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more than a gram, but it's really
lovely smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've specifically asked for one of these
because it works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_04]: No heated, no salt, no water, no nothing,
but screening and light press.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wade, does it have the THC level?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What it's got here?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is you said this is two grams,
two grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's nine hundred and fifty percent two
grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine hundred and eighty milligrams in a
two gram little puck with a little gold
[SPEAKER_04]: leaf lightning strike on it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's like forty seven or forty eight
percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just shy of fifty percent, Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And meantime, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Available in a dispensary in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't get into price, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I made dry sift that was ninety nine
point nine percent resin heads,
[SPEAKER_15]: but about the highest I ever got was in
the low 80s percent THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was from skunk number one cleaned
up absolutely clean.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was almost like smoking honey oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But didn't you prefer your 60 percent,
Sam, because I think that was well,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's easier to smoke because when you
smoke the really, really, really clean
[SPEAKER_15]: stuff, it wants to drip through screens.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it was it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It depends how you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you smoke it in a vaporizer or a glass
pipe, it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you I used to smoke an aurora bong
with three really, really fine screens on
[SPEAKER_15]: it, I think you might remember.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I put the ninety nine point nine
percent on it and I put heat to it,
[SPEAKER_15]: it would leak right through all three
screens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the guy who pardon the interruption,
the fellow who handed me this at my
[SPEAKER_04]: request points out that in California to
have it in on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thousand milligrams in any package,
that's why it's nine hundred and eighty.
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, but then what you could have done was
I'm not saying you should, but you could
[SPEAKER_15]: have made one gram on the package,
another thousand grams that would have
[SPEAKER_15]: been pure THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not saying that's better because I
don't find it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you need the full terpenes and
everything, flavor, everything else,
[SPEAKER_15]: because that's that's way better than pure
crystal THCA.
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And part of why I needed to jump in is it
has started snowing here and there was
[SPEAKER_04]: patches of blue sky, but it started
snowing again and like I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: the difference in elevation between the
town where there's electricity and
[SPEAKER_04]: Internet and where I live is eight hundred
feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We live at about a thousand meters
elevation, thirty two hundred and seventy
[SPEAKER_04]: feet is what the title says on the farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there was five feet on the
ground Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today it's down to about three feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're supposed to get that much more
again this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I promised I would leave in time to
get home safely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to sign off as such deep
respect not only for this group,
[SPEAKER_04]: but Frenchy and Madame Canole.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do look forward to seeing the film at
some point soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't my health has not allowed me to
travel very much in the last year or two
[SPEAKER_04]: since the film came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm I'm healing like many of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's a process life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so thank you all for showing up today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I I feel like I didn't know every one
of you so well and some of you better than
[SPEAKER_04]: others.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, deep respect, much love and
take care of yourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the only one you got.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Wade.
[SPEAKER_13]: Much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or to the next time, maybe for now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I appreciated that little conversation
about the dry sift, because it reminded me
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, this was one of the some
of the last conversations that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: having with Frenchy was about,
you know, because he really wanted to have
[SPEAKER_01]: that that connection to the farm and try
to figure out how to do that also
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially and to be able to put
something into the California market and
[SPEAKER_01]: he he was talking about, you know,
the regulations do allow for what they
[SPEAKER_01]: call keef and we cannot do ice water hash
on the farm without a whole rigmaroo of
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing, even though it's non volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was talking about, you know,
working on kind of and Lena and Bell
[SPEAKER_01]: probably could fill in the gaps on where
he was going with his thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was like, wow, we should be doing
dry sifting on the farm and then we can
[SPEAKER_01]: compress it and we can have put out a
packaged product that would actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, come straight from the farm and
have never had to, you know, be frozen or
[SPEAKER_01]: or travel through the distribution chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's neat to see that somebody I
don't know if that was made in a facility
[SPEAKER_01]: or on site by a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not seen that in the commercial
market before.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the reasons they should bring it
back to dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Sam, I didn't mean to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: But water is is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, like kind of the whole
fluid dynamic element behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's expensive to chill water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pumps are expensive to have water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, dry sift is is a lot more
conducive really environmentally if you
[SPEAKER_03]: really think about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: The main thing about dry sift is the yield
is is quite low.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just get, you know, one, two,
three percent yield from the best of the
[SPEAKER_15]: best of the best per kilo.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that's a killer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And but what you can do is if you have a
laboratory facility after you dry sift it,
[SPEAKER_15]: theoretically, you could take the rest of
the material and do some sort of an
[SPEAKER_15]: extract, either an alcohol extract or a
water extract or whatever to try to get
[SPEAKER_15]: more because with with dry sifting,
you're throwing away 90 percent of the
[SPEAKER_15]: THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that's just the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dry sifting yields are low.
[SPEAKER_15]: Water sifting is higher.
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, solvent extraction gets
almost everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we were trying to figure out how to
do it at scale, which is the difficult
[SPEAKER_16]: part and producing quality at scale.
[SPEAKER_16]: But the goal was to be as close to the
farmer as possible, because the less
[SPEAKER_16]: people who manhandle your product,
the better product you're going to have on
[SPEAKER_16]: the shelves.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we thought we could do something like
work through the maze of bureaucracy,
[SPEAKER_16]: but it turned out to be a lot more
difficult than we originally thought.
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a number of people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, CryoCant came out with their
liquid nitrogen unit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never really seen it used,
but I have another friend who's been
[SPEAKER_08]: working on a very similar unit that will
basically go and reduce biomass from the
[SPEAKER_08]: field direct, can be right off fresh
plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can reduce the plant matter into just
basically sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that sift can then be taken.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would have to be dried because if it's
off of a fresh plant, the wax membrane is
[SPEAKER_08]: going to hold some moisture.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is not really dry sift in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fresh sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then being able to use a static
technique or something to then clean up
[SPEAKER_08]: the sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it'll happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we will see the day where we can
scale sifting to a larger scale,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's certainly not easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's very counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_08]: The more you try to get with screens.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one of the reasons.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one of the reasons, Marcus,
that we always try to dry it for a couple
[SPEAKER_15]: of weeks, cure it for a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we had raisins rather than grapes,
reduce that moisture content so you can
[SPEAKER_15]: work with the resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I know why people like fresh live
resins, because they're definitely got
[SPEAKER_15]: more terms.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would just like to say... Hey,
Celina.
[SPEAKER_08]: Celina.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh my God, that's Celina.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have this incredible dry sift here from
Cone 5.
[SPEAKER_19]: He can explain it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's probably some of the most amazing dry
sift you'll find in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's absolutely like incredibly flavored.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, I mean, they are producing like
some really incredible dry sift material
[SPEAKER_19]: here.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is static clean and Zmuty by
Kushmintz.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's been following Bubble Man since 2005.
[SPEAKER_19]: And everything that's been coming out and
just you're the original inspiration,
[SPEAKER_19]: brother.
[SPEAKER_19]: And here's this amazing product being put
out organically from the local community
[SPEAKER_19]: here in a smoking club, which it's kind of
illegal out there, but it's legal in here.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it really is kind of an embodiment of
everything that we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you have something to say?
[SPEAKER_15]: Asking what is the yield of cleaned dry
sift where you get it cleaned up as much
[SPEAKER_15]: as you can.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of like a chemostatic because
that's, I know more than 90% resonance.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what's your yield from a kilo of
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_19]: One percent in static.
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically what you're saying, one to two
percent.
[SPEAKER_15]: One or two percent.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I keep hoping for a miracle.
[SPEAKER_19]: But dude, I mean, the flavor on this is
literally like, I hope to be smoking it in
[SPEAKER_08]: a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give us a call.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm waiting for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the most beautiful resonance,
you know, odorific stuff on the menu has
[SPEAKER_02]: been the organic dry sift pressed ash
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so incredibly beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the aged ashes,
which are just a whole other experience
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually can't say which one is my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all they're all good.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot depends on what the plant used to
make the material was and how you grew it.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of sod after hash cultivars
in this area, too.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_19]: See what people have chosen here.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, some of it's from California,
but a lot of it also is just hunted and,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, hunted and created here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's the funnest thing about
traveling is seeing the different flavors
[SPEAKER_19]: and techniques used.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's also fun seeing how different
people have been inspired by one another
[SPEAKER_19]: to make these, you know, really phenomenal
products for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the web gets wider, the weave gets
tighter.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Time for another dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, Frenchy was just super important in
the sense of, I think, passion more than
[SPEAKER_19]: anything.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like you can talk about specifics and
different hash and dry sift or age,
[SPEAKER_19]: but really it was ultimately the
attraction of his passion.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that really is the really spirit
that really it's like the spirit that
[SPEAKER_19]: enters it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's you called it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's he's a passion.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so cool that passion rhymes with
passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like it just embodies him one
hundred and ten percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now I think about passion and I
think of passion and then I think of
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just what happens now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to call him a passion,
Dean, from now on.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a new word created.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do more because we need to next
time we discover a new terpene,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can name it after Frenchy and call it
Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually there's what there's
French all that's close to Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_15]: But right.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's already French.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not all essential, essential.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Canola.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: All these new compounds that we don't know
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, I mean, isn't it is so cool
that, you know, again, we live in this
[SPEAKER_05]: great age of information.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much video content of Frenchy,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you just if today's the first time
you've ever heard of Frenchy, who's this
[SPEAKER_05]: guy?
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a lot of video to write,
Kimberly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's so much content.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this movie, I'm sure, will maybe give
us kind of like the the backstage view of
[SPEAKER_05]: his life and his past.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we going to see in the movie that
those of us who mostly know Frenchy from
[SPEAKER_05]: just his online persona, what are we going
to see in the movie that we wouldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily know?
[SPEAKER_05]: From just seeing stuff on YouTube and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I was trying to be respectful when
the rest of you are talking.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was going to say his his love for the
farmer, you know, just that's really going
[SPEAKER_22]: to come true so so clearly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kimberly, since we're on the topic,
would you mind explaining to what kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like exactly how the live stream is going
to go down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've had a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: People ask me, you know, how you know how
that's going to how they're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to view that where the multiple
places are that's going to be live
[SPEAKER_03]: streaming it.
[SPEAKER_22]: So the idea is we want to have a worldwide
celebration of the film to just create a
[SPEAKER_22]: bunch of noise and to have an opportunity
to come together after you've all seen the
[SPEAKER_22]: film on the 29th.
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're planning three screenings,
each would be at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_22]: in the local time.
[SPEAKER_22]: So first in Europe at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_22]: The film is 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_22]: Then after the film, we want to open up a
live stream like this.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be using a platform called Restream
that will have the same kind of living
[SPEAKER_22]: room environment.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then that's going to stream to our
Instagram, our Facebook, our YouTube and
[SPEAKER_22]: our LinkedIn simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_22]: So people don't have to sign up.
[SPEAKER_22]: For a new platform, they can just log on
to whatever their preferred platform is
[SPEAKER_22]: and they'll be able to access it there.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so then we'll do the same thing again.
[SPEAKER_22]: East Coast time at seven.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, you know, so starting the live
stream at eight thirty the film and then
[SPEAKER_22]: West Coast times.
[SPEAKER_22]: So you can kind of depend on what your
schedule is.
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're three in the afternoon and you
want to hang out when we do it in Europe,
[SPEAKER_22]: you're welcome to join for Europe.
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want to come for East Coast time,
welcome to come for East Coast time.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we'll have that ultimate one on
the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_22]: And people are creating ticketed events in
some of the major cities.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I've got that information on the
French dreams website.
[SPEAKER_22]: But also people are going to be doing like
they're like Etienne was saying,
[SPEAKER_22]: just having your family and friends
together to watch it in your living room
[SPEAKER_22]: and with your favorite smoking device.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm hoping all of you will join us
afterwards in the live stream and that
[SPEAKER_22]: some of you will join me in this kind of
living room environment and we can talk
[SPEAKER_22]: about the film.
[SPEAKER_22]: We can talk about what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope a lot of people will have a hookah
so that we can virtually pass the hookah
[SPEAKER_22]: to each other, because that was Frenchy's
kind of preferred methodology to get a
[SPEAKER_22]: bunch of people together and smoke.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, the hashish, if you put the
hashish in the quasar shisha head,
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, the low temperature just bakes
the material forever.
[SPEAKER_22]: So great way to have a party and have
hashish to smoke forever.
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to do some test events before then.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm hoping, Bill, you and I can break
out the hookah and show people how to set
[SPEAKER_22]: up their hookah for smoking with hashish.
[SPEAKER_22]: You can also smoke flour in it if you
prefer to smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_22]: Just thought that would be a fun way for
us all to kind of be united in in this
[SPEAKER_13]: event and this little celebration of the
film on the 29th, on April 29th.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome, Kimberly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll put it in the link as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure there'll be some groups out
here in Vancouver that will do some live
[SPEAKER_08]: streaming of the hopefully we'll get book
club.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, there's a really cool venue here
in Vancouver that does a thing called book
[SPEAKER_08]: club.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just basically a place for people
from the cannabis community to gather and
[SPEAKER_08]: actually, like you said earlier,
be able to have conversations and
[SPEAKER_08]: dialogue.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's one of the last most
important things missing right now from
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bill mentioned it earlier about
getting together and smoking.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't necessarily have to be smoking.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can just be consuming.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we need to be able to get together and
have gatherings and be able to have these
[SPEAKER_08]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've mentioned it before the way when
bars became a thing, pubs with alcohol,
[SPEAKER_08]: the working class people having these
drinks after work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those conversations would shape the
world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Eventually, we would get coffee or tea
houses next, more of an intellectual
[SPEAKER_08]: group.
[SPEAKER_08]: They would gather and drink their tea and
their conversations would shape the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it happened as well with coffee.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to happen with cannabis as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's the one thing they seem to be
holding back from us, even in Canada,
[SPEAKER_08]: federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big whoopee.
[SPEAKER_08]: We aren't even allowed to have vapor
lounges.
[SPEAKER_08]: So book club is a private club.
[SPEAKER_08]: It allows us to gather.
[SPEAKER_08]: They charge a very small fee.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll talk to Adolfo and Axel and John,
the founders of book club, and see if
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe they want to do a live stream.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'd love to have you guys as one of
the... I can have 10 people online
[SPEAKER_22]: simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would love to have you join us there.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think your son's waiting for you to go
and do something else.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: My wife's been spending the weekend at an
off-grid house on the Pacific Ocean in the
[SPEAKER_08]: Indian arms, not too far away from where
we are right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's very anxious for me to spend the
rest of the day with him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He gave me a hard stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: He came in at 11.28.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, dad, two more minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, 11.29, dad, just one more minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I explained to him what we were
talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he has an understanding.
[SPEAKER_08]: He has an understanding of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you everyone for joining us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Madam Canole for reaching out and
sort of suggesting this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was a great idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you everyone that Frenchy's touched
and all the hash machines out there that
[SPEAKER_08]: are watching.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have 234 or 240 people that have been
watching with us for the last couple of
[SPEAKER_08]: hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like I said, I'll put all the links
for the streams and anything that I can to
[SPEAKER_08]: facilitate in the description of this
video.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the meantime, I always like to end
it with a simple, may the full melt bless
[SPEAKER_08]: your bowl sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Tanner, you want to say goodbye too?
[SPEAKER_08]: See you later, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
