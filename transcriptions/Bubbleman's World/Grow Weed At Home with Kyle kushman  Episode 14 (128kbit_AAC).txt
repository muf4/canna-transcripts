we have a fantastic guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Marcus Bubble Man Richardson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on my bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, listen, uh, I'll be straight up
honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reached out to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was such an honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me, I, Matt, did I not like
immediately like glow and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, that would be so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, dude, that's, that's kind of like,
uh, it's not the beginning of our story,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's certainly, I'll never forget the
day you got the sort of like, you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a show at the cannabis cop and high
times was sort of giving you a chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: move into a new field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you were already writing for
them and you had done the whole Adam's
[SPEAKER_01]: garden and all of that awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it was like, you would,
you had this opportunity and I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: you were taking it pretty seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was one of your first guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they, they, but you know,
they didn't give me like an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically it was like, it was,
okay, you're going to Amsterdam again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to do the same old thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're going to do a gross
seminar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd been there two times before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I want to do something
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I'm going to put on a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what kind of show?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come up with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so literally I went and had cards
printed, like the Jerry Springer,
[SPEAKER_02]: like blue cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It said the grow show on the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and, and this is true story.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought this up cause I didn't think
of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to start the show with another
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed up in Amsterdam without any plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured I can, you know, I didn't,
I forgot how hectic it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And literally the night before I stayed up
with Steve Bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wrote the outline for the show and the
morning of I woke up early and went to
[SPEAKER_02]: what's the name of that pancake house?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right in the dom plots there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tourist place, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we sat there and ate and Cosmo
wrote out the chicken scratch of all the
[SPEAKER_02]: notes that I had written for the show that
you couldn't read onto my gross show cards
[SPEAKER_02]: so that I could actually do the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and that led to a historic
controversy, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, it absolutely did.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, it was a whole wild experience
the way it actually played out because of
[SPEAKER_01]: course, you know, it played back to Soma
and Soma who was, you know, friends with
[SPEAKER_01]: both of us at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Soma, you know, was also friends with
Mila and Mila was of course not overly
[SPEAKER_01]: excited that I was doing my own bags and I
was doing it from a different perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: than she chose to do it from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was having some pretty good
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously you doing the article in
high times prior to your grow show was a
[SPEAKER_01]: big help.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been already sort of popularized on
overgrow and cannabis world and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: culture dot coms, but high times was like
a whole different level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, yeah, I'm going to write an
article about you, dude, after we met in
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess instead of getting some photos
from me, you were like, I'll get some
[SPEAKER_01]: photos from Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, hey, hook me up with some
bubble hash photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave you some really beautiful
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem was was that, you know,
and the reason it got taken out on you was
[SPEAKER_01]: that Soma knew to deflect that energy by
telling when I was over at his house,
[SPEAKER_01]: he had bubble bags out on his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I love these bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more control.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's instead of just two bags,
I can make higher quality resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if Mila went over to his house,
he would take the bubble bags off the
[SPEAKER_01]: little hanger and he put isolator bags on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she was under the full assumption with,
you know, and you could kind of can't
[SPEAKER_01]: blame her that those photos were isolator
hash, not bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what she was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what she ended up blowing up on you
in front of like at your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was like literally during the
filming of your show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I literally I put on a whole show,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had I had the bong babes rolling joints
and I told the audience if they clapped
[SPEAKER_02]: really loud that they throw a lot of
joints out into the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocker T came on and did a song and closed
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually was coming on really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm out in the audience like Jerry
Springer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a time between between skits
where I'm taking questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I interviewed you and then I'm out there
and I'm taking questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this woman comes up to me and I
honestly didn't even know who she was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't until after the show that
somebody told me who that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't even know who it was when it
was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're both learning new things about
the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't this great?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm up there just in the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like really, I mean, like I'm like in
another whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm for the first time I'm putting on a
show like a show and for the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm concerned with what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I asked she asked the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something about do you realize that
I made the first bubble bags?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I I didn't know I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I basically brushed her off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but to finish this in context,
I actually spoke because I had done a
[SPEAKER_02]: story about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mila called me at the offices in high
times just a couple of weeks before I went
[SPEAKER_02]: to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she had mentioned to me she brought me
up to speed that, you know, I came out
[SPEAKER_02]: with these isolator bags a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be nice if you gave me some
some press, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made this promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't know what I'd never seen a
picture of her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I talked to her on the
television was on the telephone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even after that promise of what I was
going to do and she came up and I had no
[SPEAKER_02]: idea how to handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I didn't even know it was her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I couldn't even legitimately follow
through on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just it was really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't even in the room anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like after you interviewed me,
I bounced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have stuck around for the for the
hilarity to ensue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to start off the show with
Switzerland when we met in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you can you remember what year that
was?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say it was 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I want to say I want to say
that because Steve Breeder, Steve,
[SPEAKER_01]: myself and Scott Blakey, I.E.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shanti Baba, who were all in Lugano at the
time, had all just had baby daughters born
[SPEAKER_01]: that year, really all within like 20 days
of one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like his daughter was born on the 31st of
March.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that because that's my birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter was born on the 13th of April.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can't remember which one Shanti
Baba.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of this weird sort of
coincidence that was occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it was sort of Steve that
brought me out to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, you know, come make a bunch
of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had owed me some money, too,
that I was going to sort of collect on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, bumping into you guys
was just serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no coincidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my the first time that I ever
saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember you made a batch and then
before we went to dinner, you in your
[SPEAKER_02]: hands, you made a chunk of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looked like a little piece of bit of
honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember those old candies,
bit of honey?
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and I'd never seen that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was that was the very first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fresh and we weren't going to
try it until we let it dry or cure at
[SPEAKER_02]: least some or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or and then we came back from dinner and
that's when we indulged and and went on
[SPEAKER_02]: with a very amazing trip to to
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was nonetheless, it was definitely 25
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was literally 2001 because our
daughters had just been born.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve wasn't out there really long at all
prior to prior to his daughter being born.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that was that was a long time
ago, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good times, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was that was a super trip like
Switzerland's an amazing country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like German in the north and Italian
in the south.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get this whole French quarter
that's completely French.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's very unique little country
that's and from being from British
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia, being from the West Coast,
it's very West Coast to ask, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got these just epic mountains and
beautiful skiing and snowboarding and
[SPEAKER_01]: creeks and just it's it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You absolutely, in my opinion,
you come from one of the most beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of the globe without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's no doubt that you stayed
there for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, well, everybody's gotten a little
bit of history that we've we've known each
[SPEAKER_02]: other since we were like in our 20s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's almost high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me let me ask a few questions,
an actual be a little interviewer here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a few questions that maybe
people have been following you that you
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't been asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're native to British Columbia,
correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: You born and raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I actually was born north of North
Dakota in the Bible Belt of Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: Winnipeg, Manitoba, right in the center,
like the god forbidden and news of Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how you said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably probably told me that a while
back, but that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and then how old were you when you
migrated?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I was about 23 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was your decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we were just like, of course,
both my wife and I were like, let's go out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start a life out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, how it happened was I had my
mentor, Ron Hickey, who's just an absolute
[SPEAKER_01]: savage maniac.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an amazing man who's just will
bend over backwards to teach anyone how to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had one of the first hydroponic stores
in Winnipeg, and he taught an incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: enormous amount of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: He developed that 32 pipe system that
you've probably seen since the 80s around
[SPEAKER_02]: white pipes with the black plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he designed that system, the waterfall
reservoir, like 25 to 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like unequivocally, that was him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he did all sorts of wild stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he he I rented a house in a fairly
affluent part of Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was pretty young with his help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, look, we're going to
build you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a huge basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, we're going to go down there
and build some false walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get you like a nice thousand
square foot grow down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he like had guys come in and build it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a secret door to get into under the
staircase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally, dude, this grow was so
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like 14 lights and like
four veg split into two thirds and a
[SPEAKER_01]: third.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all wired beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had the big parabolic, you know,
HPS bulbs, hortilux bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a week after they finished building
it, the landlord called and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I just want to have someone to come in
and do some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can't remember what she called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like some sort of like basically
where they come in and measure the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the guys in the basement,
he's going like, he's like, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge section of your basement is
missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to basically get all the lights
out of the grow room, put a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: trees like way in the back with my two
iguanas and try to convince this guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is my iguana room with the secret
door under the staircase that I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring them under.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he told the landlord and the landlord
was like, yeah, you're evicted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after we built this incredible room,
I wasn't expecting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is how I ended up moving to
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so pissed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, OK, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm you know, it's time for us to go to
BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it really was the big push putting
all that time and energy and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: two months of build out into finally just
being told, you know, it was a beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: house and it was comfortable and it was
off the beaten path.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so did you, did you move out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did, did, did you have contacts or did you
just move out into, you know, another
[SPEAKER_02]: country on your own?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, well, another province in another
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super trippy, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for all these years I've known you,
I haven't been able to get into Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a, I had a company for 10 years that
made my, that my nutrients that were made
[SPEAKER_02]: in Canada and I still couldn't get into
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bizarre.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole Canadian American relationship
with trying to keep each other out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look, I look with the way things are
now, you know, you guys are kind of lucky
[SPEAKER_02]: because you have this awesome border,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have, you have the Arctic circle and
then you have us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's like, uh, you,
we, you can control that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, we got, we got, we got 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at our country,
90% of the country lives like right at the
[SPEAKER_01]: U S border within like an hour to two
hours, all of our cities are like right
[SPEAKER_01]: down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anything ever goes down,
that's really serious in America,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we'll be, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we'll have to go wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a lot of space to go North,
but there's nothing up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until then you have healthcare and we
don't kind of, it's gotten worse and worse
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get into the politics of the
country, but it was, it was the Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: you're thinking about definitely existed
like 20 to 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we got this sort of new prime
minister, it's gotten a lot different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But isn't it relative to how much worse
that the U S has gotten to?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're just living in, I feel like
I wake up and I feel like I'm living in a
[SPEAKER_02]: Mel Brooks movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he did space balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part two, the United States, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and we're not too far off to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, we're not too far off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're your, your, your brothers
from the North kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like when people are like
Canadians always want to like disassociate
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves with Americans, but like the
whole thing that makes Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada is that we have, you guys are a
huge influence on every aspect of our
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be like, I mean, not only that,
like you're a, you guys are a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: influence on every aspect of everyone's
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody exports culture the way the U S
does.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because, because I, I, the America
does United States doesn't really have any
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any storytellers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have Hollywood, you're the
storytellers and those stories are the
[SPEAKER_01]: culture that you're exporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have entertainment and we have Silicon
Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do better or as good as
anybody in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't have tradition or we don't
have a holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's distinctly the United States that
we pat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're in Canada now you've been there
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, you know, it's,
it's, it, it's hard to deny that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: become a luminary in our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, I'll define that a little bit,
you know, it, a luminary, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: happen by accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens by deliberate intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the intention that you had was to make
a mark in this world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you certainly have with a bubble hash
and a hash church and Whistler tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't know how many other
successful companies you've got going on,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I want you to tell me a little bit
about that so we can get caught up about.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the shop talk, what's going on with
your new tech these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all sorts of things in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've definitely been working with
Whistler technologies for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: building out sort of an industrial
commercial equipment that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: sacrifice the purity and the quality
that's there for the scaling up,
[SPEAKER_01]: because generally people are always afraid
to scale, especially in the already said
[SPEAKER_01]: it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already said it all because,
and I don't, and that and because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing like that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you know that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So nobody thinks like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot get anybody with millions of
dollars to invest to think like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go on, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just, uh, you know, pushing the
boundaries and the sort of innovating in
[SPEAKER_01]: regards to that equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some pretty awesome engineers
that are really just like engineers at
[SPEAKER_01]: their core and they've been getting into
hash and cannabis more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the years, as they develop this
equipment with the help of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: heady hash makers like myself,
and we've got a sales guy by the name of
[SPEAKER_01]: Tyler and one of the engineers,
Andrew is also into the heady culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that always helps when you're building
this kind of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people doing the
equipment on the commercial side now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they come from manufacturing and
fabrication, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need that side of the puzzle,
but you also need the grower, the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: maker, you know, the guy who is going to
be putting the product into these pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: of equipment, who will understand the pain
points much differently than the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like anything in cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got all these sort of big money
guys that came in and sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have this corporate culture and they
didn't really respect the people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: from the legacy and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legacy people were like, oh,
these corporate douchebags, we don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if they understood that you need each
other to sort of operate in that corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape, but still bring in that actual
culture of the grower, hash maker,
[SPEAKER_01]: the heady culture, you always need those
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always said it like both sides always
think that they're kind of the best,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like Mick Jagger and Keith
Richards, but really alone, they suck
[SPEAKER_01]: balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you put them together and you
create that third little entity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle, the rolling stones, that's the
magic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you can create that synergy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it isn't even just the ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be the right people,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've gotten in and out of,
you got to have the right people at the
[SPEAKER_02]: right time in their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got to have the right amount
of ego, the right amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: self-confidence, but the right amount of
lack of ego too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an easy, it's literally like
winning a lottery if you can nail it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's what entrepreneurs love and it's
fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm having fun with the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty exclusive for the last five
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: My contract with them just ended my
exclusive contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm able in my consulting,
which I'm doing a lot of these days,
[SPEAKER_01]: able to access different calibers of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Whistler technology is at the very,
very top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've looked, I've studied it as much as
you can, you know, online and stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's completely like,
it's really for EUGMP and GPP like be more
[SPEAKER_01]: so than like a trap labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I don't have utter and complete
respect for trap labs, but you don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: to over-engineer the equipment to that
level for that kind of lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not, you know, highly regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this equipment is highly regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it's designed is for highly
regulated markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dare say that you have not smoked any
particulate matter in 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been at least 24 to 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not wrong in that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means leaf for your neophytes out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That basically means leaf, leaf or stem
or, or a cellulose or I'm not,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm not that smart, but you're not
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me say one thing on that point
before you go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to design in my brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the bubble man brand and it's
operational in some States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to create the product where I
do an extract and it's in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I take the flower that I
extracted it from and I dry that out and I
[SPEAKER_01]: create cardboard boxes out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin itself goes into the bud made
box, which is basically cellulose and
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber, which is exactly what cardboard is
cellulose and fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So flower isn't too far off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be very easy to turn buds into a
cardboard box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the first time you've spit that,
that, that little idea or have you ever
thought about it?
I've never thought about it.
I've never thought about it.
I've never thought about it.
I've never thought about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it manifestation, I believe in
wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm already, I don't really think
you're going to have it done somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mentioned it just a few times to sort
of friends in passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've ever mentioned it on a
podcast or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be the, uh, this will be the
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would just be amazing to get
that tech down, take all your dried,
[SPEAKER_01]: your wet flower and dry it out and get it
pressed and card flipped and cart printed
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how sick would that be?
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably could manage to get a little
scratch and sniff on the back too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically like resin deconstructed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, um, I got, you know,
I do have a few questions here that I did
[SPEAKER_02]: want to make sure, cause I want this to be
informative to people, not just
[SPEAKER_02]: entertaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm having a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually if I'm having a good time,
then everybody else is too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since we're on the subject of bubble
hash, um, you know, usually I ask like
[SPEAKER_02]: people, let's give me a couple of tips on,
you know, growing at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want you to do is give me a couple
of pieces of advice for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubblers we'll call them home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubblers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will say this, you know,
how deep do you have to get?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know, you know, you can get
freezers for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can work in a freeze room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get really, really deep,
but we're going to, we're going to lay it
[SPEAKER_02]: out here for the home guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couple of tips that are above all going to
improve his general work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, number one tip is that the
bags are the word of God when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality of your resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And although cognitive dissonance will
allow you to delude yourself into thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: you have better quality flower than you
may have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've all been subject to that,
me included.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the resin will not allow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult for the resin to allow
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and what I mean by that is they're the
word of God.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you, countless people, when I release
these bags would message me and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how do I get my hash to melt like
yours is melting?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Ooh, no, that's not actually
a technique in the hash making.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually something to do with a,
the caliber of genetics that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: running.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that basically means what are the gene
synthases that are present in those in
[SPEAKER_01]: that genetic code and which one gene
synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like, you know, if you have a
THC or a CBDA gene synthase, that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: can produce CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't have the gene synthase in
its genetic code, it's, it's unable to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where breeders will figure out
what's present in a plant, even if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they can be like, Oh,
this thing has some, it has the THCVA gene
[SPEAKER_01]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can use that as breeding stock to bump
those numbers up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I won't get into, you know,
Is that what we would just call dumpers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, if, if they were the gene
synthases of, of resin and they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they could be dumpers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they were also the gene
synthases of volatile organic compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: they could also be like super flavorful
and tasty dumpers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It all depends on what gene synthases are
present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What genetics are there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it comes down to are you able to
create an environment that allows that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to sequester the components that it
requires, when it requires, where it
[SPEAKER_01]: requires, and how it requires,
you know, which I'm always, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when people say, what's the, what's the
best way to get great resin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big proponent of living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean it's the only way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've smoked incredible material resins
from non-living soils that have,
[SPEAKER_01]: that have blown me away completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not saying it's the be all end all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying that the intelligence that the
fungi has, the mycorrhizosphere that is
[SPEAKER_01]: coding your root system in a living soil
environment is an intelligence that we
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot quite understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a direct link of communication with
the plant where it's like, I need some of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, it gets it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sequesters it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It prepares it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it delivers it right to where it
needs to be in a way that, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: sure, there's probably some PhDs out there
that are very intelligent and have
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat of an understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can almost unequivocally say that
until we have like some super level of
[SPEAKER_01]: sentient AI singularity type shit,
nothing is going to be stronger or
[SPEAKER_01]: smarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to take you forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got the material.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And give us a, give me a little bit in the
technique of how to handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what people need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I like hashtag never touched
as a macro photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer that the plants don't get
touched.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want people rubbing up against
them with t-shirts or hoodies because then
[SPEAKER_01]: these big fibers stick in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same from the hash perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I start macro photographing resin and
I see when there's buds just leaning over
[SPEAKER_01]: that people are brushing as they walk by
and I get under my macroscope and I
[SPEAKER_01]: realize the resin glands have been torn
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been stretched and pulled and
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like never touched.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, I don't mind running dry material
or fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best of the best materials even dried
out will produce incredible quality
[SPEAKER_01]: hashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the fresh frozen pathway really became
a thing for people to have more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance of acquiring full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whereas old school growers like
yourself and people that we know have been
[SPEAKER_01]: curing these mono terpenes, these very
caustic rough sort of terpenes out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we cure flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get rid of that harsh stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the world of fresh frozen,
both BHO and wet wash, we're trapping all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those mono terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as you raise the terpene profile
percentage, you increase the likeliness of
[SPEAKER_01]: a shimmering melty glow as you hit that
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not necessarily the same thing as a
perfectly grown resin gland that will melt
[SPEAKER_01]: into a liquid and boil upon heat going
near it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are, those are different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm picking up what you're laying down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am picking up what you're laying down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even another way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only will they use fresh frozen for
that, they'll then take the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, you know, with, with water
hash, even for home guys, listen,
[SPEAKER_01]: the recipe is super simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow the very simple recipe of
mixing and settling and pulling,
[SPEAKER_01]: you end up getting what is there very
effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only very difficult part that involves
subtle nuances is the drying of the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the trick, drying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have, I have questions before then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so step one is dry your flower and
cure it with the, with the sugar leaf,
[SPEAKER_02]: with the sugar leaf on it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole plant, dry it and cure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and so you're going to dry it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to buck it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to put it in containers and
cure it the way an expert or, or the way
[SPEAKER_02]: the best, and that would be the,
before you would prefer taking away all
[SPEAKER_02]: the other perfections and imperfections.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in your home.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow it in your closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grew a really great batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to dry it slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to buck and you're not going
to, you're going to leave all the sugar
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to buck it down and
you're going to cure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this what I'm taking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking from you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is what you're taking from you,
but the guy next to you could have said,
[SPEAKER_01]: so what you're saying is you want me to
cut it down all fresh, freeze it,
[SPEAKER_01]: flash, freeze it, and then run it fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would suggest is both to find out
what you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see that the old school guys
prefer the cured resin and the younger
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, they're more now like addicted to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like crazy grabbed by the neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good answer is what's most popular
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, okay, so I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to, I'm going to hang it whole
and I'm going to put it into jars and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to cure it for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to trim those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to put them in jars
loosely and then I'm going to trim off all
[SPEAKER_02]: the sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm going to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, wait, there's no trimming anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using the whole buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to clean that off of all
the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to really break it down small
now that you got cured buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where I'm going to start my
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can do this at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't, we haven't, we haven't,
we haven't broken anything, made anything
[SPEAKER_02]: too heady, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that is not understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So am I, am I, is this, is this a good,
am I, am I, am I, you're with me so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, so now I got my, my five or my 10
or my 20 gallon bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course you don't want to use tap
water because water is a source of
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: It absolutely can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now keep in mind from the perspective of
the home user, it's not the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, you know, from the perspective of
the commercial producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's regulations to follow and
you want to just make sure your product,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm, if you, if you follow me,
I'm just following a simple path.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still a simple man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm domesticated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a factory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's real simple for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just bringing it along at a real
simple pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from the man who's done it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so now we got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to use either filtered
water or I'm going to go out and buy some
[SPEAKER_02]: purified water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's worth the money,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too difficult to do for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the ice, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I've exactly, so I found
water that you got exactly back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started buying clean ice, but what you
couldn't just buy ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't just buy it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wanted to buy filtered clean ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you've got most ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's in most ice, water,
fluoride, water, water is in all ice
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluoride is only in some ice, but yeah,
you buy it and you're like, why the fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: are these motherfuckers putting fluoride
in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not even sensible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even have to list it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's often okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, so, so look, I'm just hammering
the basics really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got your material, that's how you
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got clean water, clean ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now to me, the next important step
is cold water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be patient in between the
steps, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be patient in between the
steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to put the ice in the water and
let it sit for a certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is one of the things that the
fresh frozen people will say when you
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze the flour, putting the flour into
the water allows you to use less ice
[SPEAKER_01]: because the flour is so cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reduces the heat of the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just proving it's all about
expedience and or, uh, expense.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm talking about is simple and
pragmatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, uh, um, so again, bubble man says
I'm not wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to sit and you're going to
wait, good 10, 15, 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be patient to get your water as cold,
nearly as cold as the ice, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you take your material out of the
freezer and put it into the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also there's a second part to that
that you want to pay attention to,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is even the more important part,
which is first of all, you want the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature to be basically 32 degrees
Fahrenheit, zero degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you want to make sure that when you're
putting dry material, that you allow it to
[SPEAKER_01]: absorb water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to take at least 15
minutes because if you just start mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: some bone dry material that goes in there,
it'll start breaking off pieces of
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the magic of water hash is that
everything floats in the water while the
[SPEAKER_01]: resin glands, which are still affected by
gravity, uh, due to their density,
[SPEAKER_01]: they sink in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the whole process works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you break the material up to small
and it loses its surface area size,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a threshold where small
particulate will, will, will sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm bringing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm bringing you down to the really,
the really silly small granular stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the next thing I was going to
say is after patience for allowing the
[SPEAKER_02]: water to get cold, then when you do
introduce the material to the water,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need patience again, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have to let the material not
only get saturated, but you want to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure the material now comes down in
temperature to the same temperature as the
[SPEAKER_02]: water before you start mixing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you can geek out on this when
you're at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really the, the, the process is
fairly simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's scary, especially for people
that have never done it before to just put
[SPEAKER_01]: water and ice over their flowers or their
trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, when you see what comes out,
you'll just never look back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just this beautiful, sandy material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can press it the whole rosin world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't even really gotten into that,
but that's, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I first released bubble
bag, all those people that asked me,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how do you get my hash to melt like
yours?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, when you hear the answer is
like, well, you have two options.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go down a 20 year rabbit hole and
learn about the symbiotic relationships of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and mycorrhizospheres and all of
the things that they require, when they
[SPEAKER_01]: require them and how they require them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can learn about light spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can learn about greenhouses and
literally like a multi decade pathway,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you could just jam that weed into a PVC
pipe and get a can of mutane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like blast that shit into a
golden honey and it'll dab perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so unfortunately, 98% of people took
that pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was scared for those people because
a lot of them blew up and burnt themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I saw rosin come out, I saw that
it was the same same, like most people's
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin is made from mediocre bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you get full melt bubble,
there's almost no reason to press it into
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin because you're going to get like a
95% return or mediocre weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're pressing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, I don't know too many
people that do flower rosin anymore,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know that a lot of the live hash
rosin, it's very little of it is made from
[SPEAKER_01]: the most exceptional hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the people who have it will
never have the hash that they pressed the
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the rosin can look triple A,
but if, you know, it was pressed into
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin, the hash probably wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying there's not anomalies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I just, I love the fact that
rosin exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now instead of people, you know,
like imagine being a young guy in high
[SPEAKER_01]: school and just buying like a little bag
of weed and with a hair straightener,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could access dabs like solventless
dabs that you could just drop into a
[SPEAKER_01]: little, like that is huge, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can carry around a little thing in
your pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they actually work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll tell you the potency of the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can bring it, you know,
it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and, and bubs, may I call you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're old friends, bubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you, um, you exist at a level of
cannabis, um, production and consumption
[SPEAKER_02]: that all of us, I don't know how to liken
it to anything else, um, without demeaning
[SPEAKER_02]: it, because you know, I have, I do have an
ultimate respect for cannabis and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really unlike anything else more than it's
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm trying to say is that,
uh, the discussions are, um, they're very
[SPEAKER_02]: heady and, uh, uh, I, I admire how far
you've taken something that, like you
[SPEAKER_02]: said, you know, you just, you know,
even before pressing and resin,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you just, what was the old,
uh, uh, you know, if it don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it don't, it ain't worth the trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it don't bubble, it ain't worth the
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, listen, that was Rob Clark,
who I first ever heard that from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's literally how I met skunk man
Sam by using that logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to give props to Sam because it
really was Sam's sort of quote that he had
[SPEAKER_01]: said, well, it was pre the wizard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my guy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The bubble bag guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so when I started the bubble bag
company, because Hillary black had
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced me to Rob Clark, I had met him
in 95 at the cannabis cup in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight two, but I bumped into him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you remember that Thai
food restaurant behind arian's greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: off the dam rack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all like the Katoi waitresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was all, all lady boys who were
the waitress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard to forget this place because
it was pretty trippy back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they allowed you to puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were super open-minded there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember walking up the stairs to get
into that place and it was like John
[SPEAKER_01]: Conroy was there and Rob Clark had the
roar and he laid me out with a hit of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most spectacular bubbly hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looked me right in the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he looked at me and he said,
if it don't bubble, it ain't worth the
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, that stuck with me
for the rest of the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was like, I'll tell you,
you got to give Amsterdam and high times a
[SPEAKER_01]: mad shout out because, uh, that really was
the birth of, of, I mean, listen,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course this has been going on for a
thousand plus years and there's been
[SPEAKER_01]: people that have been involved in the
prohibition and the fight for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cannabis versus evil for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for our scene, that whole cannabis
cup, uh, you know, 1989 to whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: went till was really profound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, everybody that anybody thinks
of as a founder or a trailblazer in our
[SPEAKER_02]: community was on the cover of high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Dennis Perrone, Jack Herrer,
um, Aryan, uh, uh, helped me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, everybody, uh,
all of them, um, uh, Keith Stroup,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, uh, you know, uh, Tommy Chong and Jack
and so, yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And come on, there's no way I would be
sitting here talking to you because Kyle
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't have been invented and I never
would have gotten sent to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, and you know,
it really is a worth a shout back to all
[SPEAKER_02]: those people and I still keep in touch,
you know, like I said, I spoke to Andre
[SPEAKER_02]: this morning who wished you well and,
um, and remember when we raised up the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain to try and get the sun to raise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Andre could get the picture of my wife
for the cover of high times magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: On, on the top of, uh, over, over across
the river from, uh, Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Campion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Lago Lugano.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember how frantic he had to get
this picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember the sun was going down and
then we were driving around this mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: so fast that the sun was going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me you still have that picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I ever got that picture to
be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to, I'll have to see if Andre
still has that 2001 Lugano.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to ask him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what else we got here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, uh, uh, everybody,
not every, most people know about hash
[SPEAKER_02]: church that you brought back after a
hiatus and now you're, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got, you got a, how many hundred
episodes have you done of hash church?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while since I did one,
but they're always just right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've done so many, I will say that it
was 167 without a break, without missing
[SPEAKER_01]: in like seven or eight different
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just never missed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was a nine AM on Sunday,
West coast time, I made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I traveled through a blizzard in
Brampton, Ontario with two Rastafarians.
[SPEAKER_01]: After landing from Kingston, Jamaica,
while they were driving in the blizzard to
[SPEAKER_01]: get me to this house so I could turn on
and make the nine AM hash church,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, host, it was absolutely
mental.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what was driving me to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I still do it now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got some good friends that I
would like to bring forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I forget about the importance of that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it wasn't, it wasn't a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't, um, to compete with anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something that was standalone on
its, on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never took sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never, you know, we never monetized
the, the, the content because I was
[SPEAKER_01]: afraid, um, that it would affect the
integrity of the content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just never monetized it,
but oh man, did I turn down a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsorship offers for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even though, you know,
we are obviously I'm here because of
[SPEAKER_02]: homegrown and I've been working with
homegrown cannabis code now for eight
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight plus years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, but, uh, I just think it's all
about perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just try to bring on people that
have unique perspectives, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: something that has to do with cannabis,
of course, you know, or, or, or our
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then we just chit chat and,
uh, you know, um, sometimes people have
[SPEAKER_02]: products that they like to talk about,
you know, companies that they've made,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're entrepreneurs and sometimes
they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but like you said, it's, it's,
it's unfiltered as far as, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody has brought on for the sole re for,
for the main reason of presenting a
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, I'm coming around a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, listen, you remember my party back
in the day, legends of hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very much the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I refused to monetize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave away any money that we made from
ticket sales over the cost of throwing the
[SPEAKER_01]: party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would give it to like the cannabis
college or the cannabis compassion club in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam or whoever was wherever the
country was, we were throwing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would donate that money away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was somehow like, Oh, I just can't
monetize this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legends was always about celebrating hash,
not talking business, not, not like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, promoting oneself or one's
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, because it's, it's a different
world, you know, back then we had
[SPEAKER_01]: smugglers and people that were under the
radar of Johnny law that didn't want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: photographed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was no cameras, you know,
now let, yeah, now it's like, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple film crews filming everything,
recording everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's drone shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, you know, full sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the young guys, you know,
that's, that's, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the young guys don't need me to teach them
how to grow anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many good growers out there,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly I can't, I can't keep up on
my Instagram with all the production
[SPEAKER_02]: value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got learning how to press the
buttons and make it look like they have
[SPEAKER_02]: all these videographers, but it's about
perspective and unique perspectives are
[SPEAKER_02]: still valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, you know, so that's why we're
here and I'm enjoying this little chat
[SPEAKER_02]: with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I really hope that someday
the last time we saw each other was in
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica at my wedding, where you ended up
in the bar after hours, where I decided to
[SPEAKER_02]: have my after hours party.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just, we partied for three,
four multiple hours together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I smoked that was the last time
that I smoked any quantity of really good,
[SPEAKER_02]: good hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that like 2014?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was when we got married.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the year my son was born.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a baby with us that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my buddy Kimbo, my buddy Kimbo
invited us all onto his big 51 foot yacht.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had like a park.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kimbo just passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will pour a little Kimbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just died of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a great dude, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, he just, he just offered that
he's like, Hey, if you want to bring any
[SPEAKER_01]: of your friends on my boat, man,
like just put the invite out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember, you know, you and Susie
were there and Ramo and Sandra were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my, both my sons, my, my older son,
who was around 11 or 12 then, and my
[SPEAKER_01]: youngest son, who was like two months old,
they were both there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, that was a great trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, man, I just, I keep thinking,
how I can find a way to, uh, to bring us
[SPEAKER_02]: together again for a, uh, a reunion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows how that'll happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a must.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would enjoy that a great deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I would as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, uh, I have, I have a,
I have a well worded question here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's worth asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says as a respected figure in the
cannabis community, what industry issues
[SPEAKER_02]: or trends do you feel are important for us
to address or discuss?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess, you know, right off the
bat, the industry is happening in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different places simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I could speak to both kind of
Canada and the U S obviously the big issue
[SPEAKER_01]: in the, in the U S is that it's not fair
to brands and companies to have to operate
[SPEAKER_01]: in every single state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when, with the amount of states that
are allowing cannabis now, at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: federal law should pretty much kick in so
that, uh, you know, the U S can,
[SPEAKER_01]: can export their product around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see the U S hopscotch
right to the top of the game again,
[SPEAKER_01]: by literally allowing the importation of
hash from other countries and flower from
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries to bring that sort of old
school vibe back, but also to create their
[SPEAKER_01]: own federal, you know, but not
over-regulated like the Canadian one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but created something where it's like,
you know, kind of between where we're at
[SPEAKER_01]: and where we came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know a lot of people think it's
the old days were the dream days,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that was monetizing prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The money was based on people doing jail
time and there's a karmic debt that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you always saw these
amazing, like just kind, beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: families, growers, like just awesome
people getting robbed and then getting
[SPEAKER_01]: busted and then getting just like one
thing after another.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always the sort of karmic debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about, what do you think
about, um, you know, the, uh, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the psychedelic community more specific,
like the, the, the psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_02]: the mushroom mushroom community is trying
to approach it, um, where, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've learned from cannabis and you
know, they don't want, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: decriminalization or, or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you, do you see anything
positive in, in that, do you, do you have
[SPEAKER_02]: any, uh, reach or friends in that
community?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just with actually Dennis McKenna,
uh, in, uh, Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was with my youngest son and I bumped
into Dennis at, um, this mushroom event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like the 43rd annual Van
Dusen mushroom event, which was just
[SPEAKER_01]: spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did the, he, they did a whole
talk on psychedelic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at the core, at least of the
psychedelic mushroom community,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, um, it's always been an incredible
core of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been going to those sort of
psychedelic gatherings for 20 plus years
[SPEAKER_01]: where you could go and meet, you know,
Ralph Metzner and Jonathan Ott and Paul
[SPEAKER_01]: Stamets and, and Terrence and sort of all
of these guys that were writing these
[SPEAKER_01]: books about these, these compounds back in
the day, that's sort of my psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now there's a newer group that
will expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always do welcome the newer group and
focus on the good of that, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that there will be some wolves and
sheep clothing, uh, that make their way
[SPEAKER_01]: into the psychedelic community as they
always have, you know, even if you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: rainbow gatherings, uh, there's always
been these sort of percentage seeing as
[SPEAKER_02]: you, you, you, you are kind of plugged in,
you know, to the, that kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you think that there is any chance,
you know, specifically in the States here
[SPEAKER_02]: that there'll be a, um, uh, a recollection
of the experiences and the, the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: relative danger as opposed to the benefits
and that legalization will look more like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it should, or is it going to get
wound up in something red bureaucratic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a chance that they're going to
find a different route?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I surely hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have faith, you know,
keep in mind, it's always the people
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking this shit up, not the plant
medicines themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's the people who think that they
know what's best.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we just listen to these plants,
and you know, I, I'm not, for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not against there being some
regulations for producing a medicine like
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fine to have regulations now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make them insane and impossible,
but definitely like have levels that you
[SPEAKER_01]: won't accept for heavy metals and
pesticides and anything like that molds,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeasts, mildews, like these are important
things to know what the, what the potency
[SPEAKER_01]: of the product is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't sell to children, can't have a
dispenser on the corner behind a school,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some crazy ones in Canada
where you couldn't even see inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made you cover up the windows,
which made it very dangerous for the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who work there for people that
would want to go in and rob the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you could just go in, lock the door
and then be like, rob the place and no one
[SPEAKER_01]: from outside could see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was just, you made me think of
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that, uh, uh, do you think it
would make a big difference if the league,
[SPEAKER_02]: the people who are trying to legalize
mushrooms for personal use, if we simply
[SPEAKER_02]: separated any type of commercial activity
from first, just legalizing it for
[SPEAKER_02]: personal use without any restrictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you hurt somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you, there are laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you hurt somebody, generally you're
allowed to hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're at home and you chop your finger
off, you don't get charged with mutilating
[SPEAKER_02]: another person.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did it by accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: You chopped your finger off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you think that will,
that that would be a good idea to just
[SPEAKER_02]: simply try to legalize without the idea of
giving anybody the rights?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where mushrooms are,
at least here they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's only once you dry them that it
somehow becomes an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't say there's a police force
in British Columbia actively enforcing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that your distinction that you've come
up with?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, here in Canada, they're there,
they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're illegal once they're dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess it's because when they're
fresh, they're so diluted of their drug
[SPEAKER_01]: compound that it's, it's just,
I don't know what the numbers are,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it might even be that way in some of
the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty silly, but it's kind of like
them every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked a bunch of psilocybin mushrooms
this year, cyanescence and Alies and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: some stunsies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the big ones out here in LA,
which are like replacing all the
[SPEAKER_02]: housewives anti-depressants are
albinoavary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are potent stropharia cubensis
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's doing them in gummies and
microdosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do, I do now and then, you know,
I even, I, I, I tried to find out if it
[SPEAKER_02]: would be a good thing for me to do on a
regular and I, you know, without
[SPEAKER_02]: stereotyping it or without even putting in
a negative, I just, I couldn't find a
[SPEAKER_02]: regular dose for me that was helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was always some kind of a come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a regular, it's, it's an irregular
use thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much were you like, cause generally a
microdose of psilocybin, you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so subtle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I found was that after,
you know, if I even got up to 150 mics
[SPEAKER_02]: that at the end of that day, it was still,
there was still some kind of a come down
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's my own physiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I couldn't find a neutrality where
I only got that, you know, where you take
[SPEAKER_02]: it and you forget you took it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And three, four hours later, that's why I
had such a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great thing that I would love to
be able to do and take every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on your definition of
the microdose because there, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely different definitions of
microdose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people they'll be like,
Oh, I take like a third of a gram or a
[SPEAKER_01]: half a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Whoa, that's like, really like
to like, what I talk about as a microdose
[SPEAKER_01]: is an, is a true microdose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no psychedelic effect to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't affect like your appetite or
your, it's just this super, super slight
[SPEAKER_01]: nudging of your overall being and how you
feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very subtle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I like it myself, which is
very, very, very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a way to test my psilocybin,
so I don't know exactly what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know with the dry mushroom,
that if I eat like a stem and they're very
[SPEAKER_01]: thin stems, a little thicker than semolina
and siatas, these are the wavy caps,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cyanescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: One small little stem is a perfect
microdose where maybe I might feel
[SPEAKER_01]: something for five minutes, like a little
bit like, Oh, I feel like I took a dab or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, but it'll just dissipate in
five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep it below the threshold of
feeling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can do it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after like 20 or 30 minutes,
30 days of that, it builds up the effects
[SPEAKER_01]: of how good you feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad we got into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a crushing depression, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an important thing nowadays for just
people to have options other than going to
[SPEAKER_02]: the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And particularly the psychiatric and
mental health problems, those types of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines are, you know, SSRIs and
whatnot, they're fairly harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to at least have something else on the
table, I'm not saying that every single
[SPEAKER_01]: person shouldn't take those drugs because
maybe some people get helped by them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's a lot of people that don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you take a drug for depression or
suicidal ideations and the top side effect
[SPEAKER_01]: is may cause suicidal ideation,
that does not line up to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and they, and they, they can get away
with saying it right on the television.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening, you're not paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: The TV's running in the background and you
hear may cause death.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of side effect is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a seriously harsh side effect
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because they listed it, they're no
longer liable and America runs on
[SPEAKER_02]: liability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all you got to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless America.
[SPEAKER_02]: God bless America.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, uh, other than us,
uh, getting together, we talked about the
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble hash and we talked about how we met
and we talked about how much we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: see each other again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we gave respect to the old days
of high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think before we, before we signed
on, we, we gave a little respect to some
[SPEAKER_02]: of our missing soldiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we miss, uh, we're not going to
name, we can't name everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we, we miss, we miss Frenchie and we
miss sub cool and we miss Eddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Franco and Jack and yeah, all these
people, you know, that, uh, we're taking
[SPEAKER_02]: from us and, but we remember them and we
smoke in their honor and we mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: their names often.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, we, we recite the stories and the
things that they taught us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, that's what it is being a,
uh, an OG, an old timer, old school
[SPEAKER_02]: industry in old school culture type
person, you know, it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you said, you know, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of people that came before
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't invent the cannabis culture,
but boy, was it rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we, when we were early and high
times was still an icon of America and
[SPEAKER_02]: every stoner in the world bought it or,
or stole it off the news rack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when the Dutch were still open
minded, right before they went right wing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like closing down the red light,
trying to shut down, like make it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the Dutch experiment where it's
like 10 coffee shops and 10 companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: will represent and produce all the flower
and the hash for each of those coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, they want to lose the value,
which is the importation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want that, that coin for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they were smart, they would go to
those countries and say, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: we pretty much fucked your country over,
uh, for a long time, especially back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the Dutch were the original sailors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They taught the Russians how to sail and
Russia damn near took over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the Dutch, they were out there
sailing before many and they, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, they, they, they could go to these
countries and make deals where if they
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized it, you could import it into,
it would just be a special thing when you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't try to control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you still, in my opinion, the perfect
world will be when cannabis is legal
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere, but I can get Lebanese hash or
California, oh, you need to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: it from that spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't have a palette.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people can't taste the difference
between a McDonald's hamburger.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't have a palette for
cannabis or hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't have a palette for
culture, but it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: For people to get together and just pay a
little reverence, tell a few old stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember what the old times were and pass
it on to the young ones who weren't born
[SPEAKER_02]: when you and I met and smoked our first
bowl of bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Hey man, I just want to thank you for
being on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a total blessing and you are a,
uh, you are a chieftain among chiefs.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my, in my, in my heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, if you ever have anything of
consequence or humor or of any type of
[SPEAKER_02]: entertainment value that you want to share
with us again, you just call us up again
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'll do this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's up, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, uh, enjoyed hanging and talking
to you on a Sunday afternoon here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, just a beautiful day,
blue sky and just seeing your smiley face
[SPEAKER_01]: and hearing your voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was indeed a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to, uh, to seeing it going
live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uplifting is what I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely uplifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, with that, we're going to sign off
and, uh, you have yourself a great day
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, I would say stay green,
but, uh, that doesn't apply to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last thing I want is green hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you can tell me to stay gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay gold, my brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that was enlightening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcus Bubbleman Richardson is not just an
expert on bubble hash and
[SPEAKER_02]: entrepreneurship, but he is genuinely an
extraordinary gentleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you all for being here for
another episode of Grow Weed at Home with
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And please tune in for the next
extraordinary episode of Gua!
