[SPEAKER_01]: Hey good morning everyone, Bubble Man
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 5 in the morning right now and
I am gearing up finally today to head over
[SPEAKER_01]: to Toronto for that next generation
financial conference that John and I are
[SPEAKER_01]: both speaking at and then on Friday we're
heading over to Jamaica for this project
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've got brewing so we'll keep you
informed on how that's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured I'd wake up today and have a
quick little puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Swiss perk is a little bit dirty but
nonetheless got some full melt dry sift
[SPEAKER_01]: here that I made the other day and I
figured I would share a bowl with the
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna be seeing my good buddy
Chester.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have met Chester before on my
trips to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the dude that was doing the tuk-tuk
riding with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I of course haven't forgot you Chester.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got your astro boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got your sweet skunk and of course we
got your Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chester's been growing probably for 40
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a really old school good friend of
mine and I'm very happy to be bringing him
[SPEAKER_01]: some genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's have this quick puff and we'll
get on the road and we'll go meet Johnny B
[SPEAKER_01]: at the airport for a little airport
session.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we always do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright that is the power cloner 45 plant
botanic care power cloner that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: hear in the background bubbling and away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there's nothing left to do but
grab these genetics and get on a plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you come join me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No you didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god that would have been so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got here with Mike and Johnny B at
the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toronto Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we're gonna get our luggage
throw it in there and come out and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So catch up with you in a second here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright so we got our bags checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our bags are checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my oil slicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: My trippy stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tripping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say oh boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get trippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get trippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna throw a little fresh frozen
astro boy in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh frozen astro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got some fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've always got fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you excited for this trip John?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to Jamaica dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude I know you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you not be excited?
[SPEAKER_01]: We speak at the next gen conference in a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a good conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be some good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect it'll be a lot bigger than
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a larger population out east of
course and there's a big financial
[SPEAKER_01]: district in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's gonna be one of those epic
life changing events over the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially historical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna say it could be historical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday's gonna be the day to really start
watching Bubble Man's World if you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: before because Friday's the day we land in
Kingston Jamaica at the Norman P Manley
[SPEAKER_01]: International Airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will head into the city and we'll go
make sure we go by Emancipation Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe hook up with the Nomads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call up a couple of other friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if we can't hook up with Claude in
Kingston.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh actually I think he's even gonna be on
our plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both Claude and Ashley I think are gonna
be on our plane so that's even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know it's definitely exciting
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we go clear security?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hit this trick a few more times
but definitely not gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you guys on the plane.
I
[SPEAKER_00]: like the little mall.
See the mall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey you know the casino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before they do a bus thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever see that before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright well John we're here in the back
of our car of our good buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the front here Ashley say hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are a big part of the Jamaican
project that we are a little bit hush hush
[SPEAKER_01]: on but they picked us up at the airport
and now we're just well they're puffing a
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got puffing there Johnny?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually smoking some Dennis Hopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm playing you some reggae music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh some reggae music.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gonna be a great trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch you guys in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: One minute warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heading into Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a great laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make sure this is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always want to make sure the D-nail is
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of pooched the whip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: See the little blow?
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my whip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I damaged the whip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well yeah I damaged it when we pooched the
D-nail in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did we pooch that D-nail again?
Alright so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you see this little dot right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like right below 900 is usually when
it clicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it doesn't want to heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like the little piece in here
that it's measuring with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I damaged it when we blew it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: D-nail has done me nothing but solid by
the way as we talked about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually to go back before even
talking about the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: John and I were laughing right before we
started the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to do a video on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how they do mean tweets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you get famous people reading
tweets that are just cruel and unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they read them and it's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well John and I have been getting some
very cruel and unusual comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'll give you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99% of you guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be intent on crushing our
souls.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of crazy but at the same time
we're happy to be doing these videos for
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's telling us that this bad thing or
that bad thing about us is really going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get us to not.
[SPEAKER_01]: No it actually makes me smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the more that we see it the more
that we realize that we're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: getting to more people and educating on a
bigger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the best thing about it is we're
here sharing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what just happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the middle of talking something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mind got completely distracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full male dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It self pressed itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that eh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh does that ever smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay we're hitting this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah we're hitting that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we realized is when with a buddy
make sure you always have separate skillet
[SPEAKER_01]: tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Separate skillet tools is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: John and I of course are spending an
enormous amount of time with each other
[SPEAKER_01]: lately in hotel rooms and planes and
traveling all over the freaking world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time we have a lot of the
same things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have similar pipes and same skillet
tools and t-shirts and hats and just all
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that we're friends with give us
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're at Ripper Seeds they're going
to give us both shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're over at Medical Seeds they're
going to give us both shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know Rare Danka sends out a
hoodie well he's sending him one out too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of the same things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're starting to like label our stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're figuring it out John.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh it's a very nice thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great great great trip coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed the session at the airport but it
was so cool of Ash to pick us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got picked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to get in there so we did the
session in the car of course which you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jammed this in reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah jammed this in reggae and now we're
doing a session with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to keep this short.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to do a couple of bowls
each.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to go out and enjoy this
lovely city for a couple of days and might
[SPEAKER_00]: need to see you around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely going to try a hit of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to move on to the
stuff that I made actually late last night
[SPEAKER_00]: because I realized I was running out and
I'm like well shit I cut down all my
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been hanging and I'm like I got to
trim this stuff up so I did a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bounce and you know what the rest is
frozen for when I get home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dry sit that I cleaned yesterday just
turned out exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't believe how nice it turned out
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to roll into town with a melty
dry sit and be able to share it with
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, de-nail dabs and I'm hoping I
don't even get in a little away while I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I brought some fun-filled
med-tainers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to just grab them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All your med-tainers are fun-filled.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's got like about 10 or 15 med-tainers
just stuffed full of nice herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know they're not stuffed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've done is I did the Vancouver
420 label.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have some MK Ultra THCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have in the roster we have the
Dennis Hopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course the one and only.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bubble man one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one there is the Haas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh the Haas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like the Haas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what these are probably going
to turn into some gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might smoke a few but I'm definitely not
taking these with me to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like 12 people and they're
going to get lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I think one of the people right off
the bat is our driver today.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: They picked us up at the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should at least give him one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the girl pops we should give her
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know one each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean they picked us up at the
airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: They carried all our bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: They brought two vehicles just so they
could carry all of our bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just me and John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah but the amount of bags we had?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll show the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright so one more quick one and I guess
we've got meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to go meet up with Harry and the
Next Gen crew don't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say I got this stuff that I did with
the MK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah it's the MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I put it in the House of
Grave garden around a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to put this later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like the first bounce of that
beautifulness that I always talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hit it right now man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah so good to be in Toronto puffing bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two more days and we're in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've been saying that a lot but
it's going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah dinner and meetings tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow we have more dinners and more
meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh here's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I get this video up in time you guys
want to come down and meet us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chill out with us puff some bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're thinking of going to Vapor Central
on Yonge Street or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it on the other one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look it up on Google it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vapor Central.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might end up there either I mean I
guess potentially tonight but that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little early.
[SPEAKER_01]: More likely Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say Thursday night after
the Next Gen conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be having a party
probably there and all going to be sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: around drinking and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well maybe we'll announce at Next Gen that
we're going to be going to the Vapor
[SPEAKER_01]: Central.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there are people who don't have the
interest on drinking that they can welcome
[SPEAKER_01]: us down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to a nice little puff party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly a puff party.
[SPEAKER_00]: A puff party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright well I'm puffed up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed those nice little rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some meetings with the guys from
the Next Gen conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said six o'clock in Harry's room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six o'clock so we're going to go and see
Harry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey we've got 24 speakers here over the
next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to film a little bit more
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them little clips of almost everyone
speaking so they get a better idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time I really only videotaped you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirk, Jodie and what's her name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Allison?
[SPEAKER_01]: Adriana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adriana Herman.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good and I'm looking forward to
being a part of it this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to go head up there and we'll catch
these guys later?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys it's the end of the night here
but I thought I'd share this as I was
[SPEAKER_01]: gearing up and I was going through this
product Grunge Off.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of mine owns this company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually quite a really good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I originally saw this quite a few
years ago in Amsterdam and someone had
[SPEAKER_01]: told me that it was like from a soybean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oil extracted from a soybean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a type of oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sort of organic cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works hella good but how I keep my
mothership clean is I fill it up with
[SPEAKER_01]: Grunge Off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a little bit run out of the base
there but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fill it up with Grunge Off and I let it
soak overnight and then I also fill up a
[SPEAKER_01]: glass and I've got the quartz bowl and the
other piece my 14 to 14 mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mail to mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically this just makes it so it's
real easy to clean in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a quick rinse and everything will
clean out perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way it makes life a little bit
easier for us as we're traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to take this to
Jamaica in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to be clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we leave Jamaica we want to make
sure that it's clean coming back into
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway I thought I'd share that with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep watching Bubble Man's World and we'll
see you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: you you you
