[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, it's time for another dab of
the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pressed it out and it kept breaking and
when I actually tried to make a hole in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle, it just cracked right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's see if we can't get the bowl in
place here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I mention we're going to be smoking it
off of the ceramic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here goes for nothing.
Shhhhhh!
