probably within the next hour and a half
[SPEAKER_05]: so we have a short little bit of time to
You know puff joints and smoke hash and
[SPEAKER_05]: whatnot So I think John B is on his way as
well with a bunch of different flavors and
[SPEAKER_05]: the level in here Well, I have a
supplement I do well, we should get it
[SPEAKER_05]: plugged in because that's really the only
way I can enjoy the herb In the meantime
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Are you gonna come sit with us?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah seat Matt's joining us from the
island.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody dry sit to fish an auto
make some beautiful Beautiful hash in fact
[SPEAKER_05]: such beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna put mine aside and try something
is Should I try?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how it's a lovely smell and is this
a sweet stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the sweet stuff not clean
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really notice it on the bouquet
this one has really noticed it on the
[SPEAKER_05]: clean this one has like an adhesive smell
these two Smell it deep and then smell
[SPEAKER_05]: this one and see which one you find has
that more
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I put it in too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all gummed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been drying for two boat today.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's brighter Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's more intense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it stays longer I don't it's this
one has something deeper in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a woody Woody spiciness to
this probably more plant-based.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me take a little of this one here
Which one's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we call it the JT 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fish variety of some sort But I
just think it's about two days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that dry sifted as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks wet washed Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the way it wets I think you should
let it dry a little bit though You think
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter what if you let it keep letting
it dry a little still sort of You know
[SPEAKER_05]: what I just talked about this recently
about getting the moisture out Which is
[SPEAKER_05]: why it's so important to make the moisture
out and then it allows you to actually
[SPEAKER_05]: cure the hash Which is basically
dehydrating the wax membrane You know the
[SPEAKER_05]: wax membrane is thicker when it's got that
moisture if you see the photographs of the
[SPEAKER_05]: live dry homes They just look so good and
it's crazy that I haven't shot as much dry
[SPEAKER_05]: down because it doesn't look as good but
I'm gonna get into it because Those heads
[SPEAKER_05]: you look like raisins, you know,
they just dry right out that the hands get
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of ridges in them and they That
stuff and I really learned this from guys
[SPEAKER_05]: like Sam and Rob it becomes infinitely
smoother to smoke on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah when you cure it Might lose a little
bit of the terpenes in the long run just
[SPEAKER_01]: through sort of natural volatility of the
terpenes, but that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nemesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nemesis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh that nemesis is nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the sparkle it leaves on the
table.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh so airy and fluffy, but look at that
dank Really nice That was nice island
[SPEAKER_05]: sweet skunk as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: No just regular sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh sweet skunk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Just from holding and passing those
nugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer regular to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's sticky Which one was the one yet
the wet wash that you pulled and
[SPEAKER_05]: stretched?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was this one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see that little guy Looks
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a kush of some sort.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, very melty.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure To try and get some macro
shots for those of you guys watching at
[SPEAKER_05]: home right now Really see it otherwise
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have it's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some stuff that In the summertime
it was like it was snapping.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was like pieces of shatter falling
off And then when it got really hot and
[SPEAKER_04]: humid it changed consistency and since
then it's been the same It's like this oil
[SPEAKER_04]: slick.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the weirdest Yeah, I have some oily
water hash that's about five years old now
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's just over time has completely
It's like the wax membranes have like just
[SPEAKER_05]: disintegrated and it's just this I have it
out on an oil slick and people constantly
[SPEAKER_05]: are like you're hitting oil
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it really is interesting to see
the reemergence of dry set coming back
[SPEAKER_05]: around though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, California guys Yeah, well,
I think he's doing doing a lot of solvent
[SPEAKER_05]: list water extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure he's played around with Dry
sit yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave him a bubble box not this year at
the cup But last year and I haven't seen
[SPEAKER_05]: him post any pictures yet, but I'm waiting
It's not a big amount of screen to play
[SPEAKER_05]: with him and he's got the fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got to think that That he'll
produce some in the near future calling
[SPEAKER_05]: you out Nick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I we want to see your dry sift make some
dry set for us If it's anything like your
[SPEAKER_05]: hash, I think will be pleasantly
Pleasantly happy with your results.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so this one is This one is not
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is Bubba and OG not like together
like across but just two separate things
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah We got things coming at us from all
angles What do we got here Jesus who's
[SPEAKER_05]: packing the 20 hits?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a single shot or it's a single
shot It's a big Samson dad Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: just kind of leave it like that a little
Carbon it was a huge hit Oh Wow that
[SPEAKER_05]: reminded me of being at Sola's place
[SPEAKER_05]: Also just loves to pack Huge bowls and so
I have to admit I do appreciate it like
[SPEAKER_05]: that because I mean I got mostly like a
terpene hit but a huge crazy smoky terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: hit Thank our unknown donor and marijuana
man as well who's just sitting off camera
[SPEAKER_05]: Puffing as tough as he possible donor to
the unknown donor Realize there was water
[SPEAKER_05]: in that pipe But like enough that it's
covered all the purse
[SPEAKER_05]: Brought my little scope sell these a fresh
Hatties.
[SPEAKER_05]: They even got the little black light for
seeing if counterfeit money
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're looking at a good solid 70
plus I Wish I could share this actually
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to I'm gonna get my macros and
macros and and because you have to see it
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't just talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be absolutely right And of
course we have to hit it as well Because
[SPEAKER_05]: this is the let's get As stoned as we can
episode plus we're at the pot TV studios
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, there's a we got Mark Emory
representing nice blanket of smoke That
[SPEAKER_05]: does look very nice, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go That's the number
one that's pretty much the number one Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: that we sell the Afghani from the house of
the great gardener Number one for pain of
[SPEAKER_01]: what we have anyway, and that's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the taste a lot of strength policy
what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did these genetics were collected or
grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how do you use genetics work sort of
collection of the best?
[SPEAKER_01]: Trains and compassion clubs all the way
across Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks That's a great source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we just got a lot of the clubs
together and we said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's what works good for you This is
what's good for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're willing to trade that's trade you
guys can have these ones We can have these
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So open up the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I think we've got the John
D at a Montreal The hayalma strain which
[SPEAKER_01]: is here that strain was phenotype selected
by the members of the club So which one do
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys like the best sort of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We narrowed it down to yeah the three top
phenotypes and then we put it to the
[SPEAKER_05]: members To me that's kind of the ultimate
cup, you know It's reminiscent of Shiva
[SPEAKER_05]: Ratchery in Nepal each year, which is
Shiva's birthday and it lasts for months
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, they'll have these
gatherings lots of the sadhus and the
[SPEAKER_05]: babas the shevite babas show off of course
these guys pop extremely tough Chillums
[SPEAKER_05]: and grams of hash in a puff type of thing
and they just put out there On little
[SPEAKER_05]: plates right and who is ever a hash is
gone first Right, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no trophy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no like posting it on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just Your hash got smoked first
and that says everything everybody knows
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing else Exactly right that was a
nimbing That's I remember barges photos
[SPEAKER_05]: because he went with you that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you not?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was great Good Good historical
words.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take a hit to it's a barge aka the
tricone farmer good friend of ours canvas
[SPEAKER_05]: photographer here for years He moved off
to Switzerland and lo and behold never
[SPEAKER_05]: came back So we miss him I think about I
used to see him every once in a while it
[SPEAKER_05]: shows in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go do a show in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go do a show in Germany He was right
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd show up with chocolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd show up with chocolate Truly a bubble
ambassador tricone farmer was a bubble
[SPEAKER_05]: ambassador of the highest caliber
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and it was that Amsterdam at
someone's place and his old place And his
[SPEAKER_01]: old place when he had it was like two-tier
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you'd go up the stairs
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you used to be able to go down to
the second floor you would open up the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole wall I mean, I've known someone for
a long time, but that must be going back
[SPEAKER_05]: along.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been in this part I would have
definitely been there then too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might even been there when you met barge
Usually had a booth yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: The good old cannabis cup I got millions
of cannabis cup stories Going since 1995
[SPEAKER_05]: we had a good time this year Well,
I can tell you I've been like 17 or 18
[SPEAKER_05]: times and it was really fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really good It was a good group of
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think the cup is what you make
it, you know, it's really kind Of like if
[SPEAKER_05]: you are in with I mean you got treated
like gold by Ariane in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's very unique You know if you
can have that experience, that's great You
[SPEAKER_05]: know when I used to hang out with breeder
Steve back in the day in Amsterdam Ariane
[SPEAKER_05]: also Loved Steve and always treated him
with the utmost respect and just the few
[SPEAKER_05]: times I got in with Steve to receive that
You know shine that he was doing it was a
[SPEAKER_05]: good feeling for certain, you know,
hey I met Neville and Howard marks like up
[SPEAKER_05]: in his Apartment, you know, that was all
all people closed doors.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just never get behind back then So you
would have the cannabis castle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just missed the cannabis that was in 95
that they shut it down I think 96 it was
[SPEAKER_05]: shut down but 94 95 there were tours for
the cannabis castle and I remember my
[SPEAKER_05]: friend's daughter was actually the girl
that worked on the bus and another friend
[SPEAKER_05]: of mine recently just told me his daughter
also was working during those years so two
[SPEAKER_05]: of my friends their daughters were running
the sort of tours back and forth to the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis castle, so Yeah, that was an
amazing place.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you got lucky enough to go to the
cannabis castle, you know in 94 95 it was
[SPEAKER_05]: a very unique place just outside of
Amsterdam that Oh My goodness,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, all sorts of incredible breeding all
sorts of incredible cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: So It was definitely one of my you know
Not quite my favorite place I've ever got
[SPEAKER_05]: to visit in Holland, but it's up there in
the top three for sure There's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: things have happened in Holland in regards
to breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that people forget sometimes It's
easy to go to Amsterdam buy shitty weed at
[SPEAKER_05]: a coffee shop and be like this place sucks
I think people have the same experience
[SPEAKER_05]: they come to Vancouver or potentially try
to buy weed off a sketch bag on the street
[SPEAKER_05]: get rocked get robbed or lose their money
in the least and then they don't like
[SPEAKER_05]: Vancouver or they or even worse they get
shitty weed and then tell everyone
[SPEAKER_05]: Vancouver has shitty weed it's like it's
your ability to find Good weed that's at
[SPEAKER_05]: stake here not Vancouver's ability to
produce good weed anywhere I found the
[SPEAKER_05]: same thing even about awesome hash That's
it, you know with computer Website rooms
[SPEAKER_05]: and chats now, you know like-minded people
finding each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started this site on Facebook called
team dry sift just a couple months ago
[SPEAKER_05]: team dry sift team dry sift
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely not team dry sift A group of
people together functioning together So
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like 300 members in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people producing 99% gland head
hash in there See the pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's good People need to know that
this isn't something that you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe the few can do it's something that
only the few choose to do Put a screen
[SPEAKER_01]: under your drying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trim your dry cannabis onto a screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let it bounce onto a screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your drying rack should be made of screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time you flip your shake,
you'll be amazed at the quality of the dry
[SPEAKER_01]: sift you get as the shake dries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get some incredibly good quality
hash doing just that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even without cleaning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on how gentle you are,
you can get some amazing ... I tell people
[SPEAKER_05]: this is falling off your plants anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because you're not collecting it
doesn't mean ...
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the drying line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it off the drying line to get that
little snatch.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, won't that lower the quality
... We're not telling you to bounce all
[SPEAKER_05]: your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're telling you to ... You have to cut
it off the stalk anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut it off into a plastic dish or a bowl
or ... Just have a screen and cut it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it bounce on the screen and that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't ... Al's making hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't bounce it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even need a screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But truly, just throw any, even like a
piece of glass under there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see what you're losing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely ... For the screen size,
for those of you that might not know the
[SPEAKER_05]: proper size, what would you say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywhere between a 140 and a one ... I
would say like a 140 to a 155.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people like to go big.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people online are doing ... I use
the lines per inch more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you get the stainless steel
... I use lines per inch as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Silk as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lines per inch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just talk Micron because when I talk
lines per inch ... Most people understand
[SPEAKER_05]: Micron.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because 200 lines per inch is like
70 Micron.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you put the 200 on the bottom?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 100 goes on the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: A 110, I guess, would be around what you
would want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are what I sell on my site.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the 200, I used to sell a 300,
which is like a 45.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too tight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a 325.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very hard to clean on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like ... It's extremely tight mesh.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like ... The 70, I like for people to
learn on and see results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you want to play with a 50,
that is patient man's work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully you have a cold environment
because trying to break any type of
[SPEAKER_05]: contaminant through those little holes is
a bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who needs a monitor?
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't been puffing enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I did put it right in front of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Loving all the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it all on the inside of my medtator.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medtator John.
[SPEAKER_05]: Missing Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you believe it?
[SPEAKER_05]: He was supposed to be on his way here with
his sublimator and all his flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We might still get a little bit of that
happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, John.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's running around, doing the good work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's always hustling.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, two, dab yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dab it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never filmed an episode down here at
Paw TV.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've gone on all my friends'
shows, but I've never actually come and
[SPEAKER_05]: filmed Bubble Man's world down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been on a Bubble Man show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Al also, who I've known for 25 years,
knows Ron really, really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know a lot of you guys are big fans
of Ron.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get any footage of Ron when you
were down there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tons of footage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I'm telling you, people are
like, Ron's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is this guy?
[SPEAKER_05]: What an eccentric guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ron is a fucking icon and a pioneer in
indoor gardening in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like really.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy was growing indoors in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, even he said in the late 60s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about like 1000 light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Ed Rosenthal talks about they
didn't really figure out the flowering
[SPEAKER_05]: thing until around 77 or 78, where we got
guys like Ron, who was in Budfuck,
[SPEAKER_04]: Winnipeg, in that freezing cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, growing under staircases and
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's still flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even after serving 11 fucking years in
prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a federal kind of country, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in a hardcore prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: As hardcore as it gets for Canada,
anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to see him out and it's good to
see him growing great pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's, you know, you take that
out of somebody's life who's been doing it
[SPEAKER_05]: their whole life and it creates a void.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that void creates sadness,
creates all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was definitely more bummed when he
wasn't allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like really not allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just got out for the second time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got to like seriously.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then he gets a license.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what getting moving to BC gets you.
So what do you got here?
I was going to ask that same question as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: This little thing or this little thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the OilSlick.
[SPEAKER_05]: OilSlick is the company.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do these platinum grade silicone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big in the oil community because the oil
doesn't stick.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in the hash community that I'm
in, I like to stay on top of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, when the guys at
OilSlick, Lars actually, via the guys at
[SPEAKER_05]: OilSlick passed this on to me,
I started playing around with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I melted some bubble onto it and I pressed
some.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be heated up and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can cook cookies in the oven and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can just like.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice surface to work on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every one of those for myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: How well dry some could be maybe on the
other side, which is a lot smoother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a little, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one is the K9 tube who,
I guess Zion, in Holland, I am sorry I
[SPEAKER_05]: still have this Zion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to send this back to you and I will
send this back to you this week.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just makes such a great carb cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I've been using it to carb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a little pipe that has a nail
and a dome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little ring that goes around your
neck on a little pendant thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All these fun little things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Little microscopes, little containers,
trippy sticks, skillet tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the tools we need.
[SPEAKER_05]: To chain smoke cannabis resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So ready for another riff there,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what you're hitting or what
you're feeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of different.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the last of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a great little unit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say I do have, I have been
enjoying it pretty much for that on any
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That particular nail is a 14.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can use that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you would like to carve it,
you'll find that it's a lot easier once
[SPEAKER_05]: you bring it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. John B in the house for puff
Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to sit down with
John here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_05]: John has finally made it to puff
Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you had a little bit of drama
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Small.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you brought your sublimator and some
flavors and Matt nice things as well here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So also left this ridiculous, which I'm
going to start it off with almost much
[SPEAKER_05]: like my five year cured master Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just like oiled out resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just, it really reminds me of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, if I didn't have bubble that
was doing this right now and I didn't know
[SPEAKER_05]: how I'd be like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can still see it's got that hash
thickness to it, even though it is pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: much an oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clean this out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Al.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks Al.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, we're surely bubbling up the clear
gums.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some herbs here in the bag so I can
see all the crisp just stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I offer you a hit of John?
What's in what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, why don't we go right to what I just
had?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at this for some reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one, you definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will hit that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll double you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll give you a small one of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on John, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peer pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's John doing for the rest of the
day after this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well, I'm going to hang out here and
I'm going to puff hard with Greg and Al.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got their weekly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're puffing on Wednesday at your
place most of the time, I don't get a
[SPEAKER_02]: chance to come by and see these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm here, of course I'm going to see
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, I'm going to puff their room
anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not some killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no shortage of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No shortage.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty of it to be had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm down to the nitty gritties of me
having to go do some work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was something here that I recently
just kind of took a quick look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, it's going to be some
cleaning I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought a little microscope today with
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just grabbed it quickly and I was like,
you know what, this is something that
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely needs some work because I know
it doesn't melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of tried because I already know the
work I did with it was just minimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit of contaminant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, probably about maybe 30 or
40 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I figured.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of nice heads though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That there is my happy bone cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get down and look at it at that
level and you see how small these things
[SPEAKER_05]: are with the naked eye, they seem to be
bigger to me when I look at them under my
[SPEAKER_05]: macro lens because sometimes I have the
back of my camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other times I do live view shooting with a
monitor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I can see it very big.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to look through this little scope and
to see how tiny these little things are,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you want to check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty incredible to think of the
work that it takes to get those
[SPEAKER_05]: contaminants out, separated from just the
heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's tricky work.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's definitely my next step.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, generally at this level,
it's just around 60 percent won't quite
[SPEAKER_05]: melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might sizzle a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually when you get up to about 80 is
when people think they have full melt
[SPEAKER_05]: because it does actually melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's really into the 90s that you see
the real full water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really a photo?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a little lazy sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to the 90s and I'm like,
I gotta go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that 90?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm confident.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have this microscope.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the joy of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how was your time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it was really great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a great time seeing my friend Ron.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely watched the videos,
but I had a chance to sit down and say
[SPEAKER_02]: hey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing Paul.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was just good.
[SPEAKER_02]: How were the guys from the Holy Smoke when
I saw those guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I ended up just seeing Paul.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy Smokes is actually not around
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It closed a while ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I got to see Paul and I got to see
Dave, the garden sage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: He came over with the tumble now and we
did the little video.
[SPEAKER_05]: All around fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Kootenays is a great place to go see a
bunch of cool people.
[SPEAKER_05]: At 5am you were out sifting?
[SPEAKER_05]: 3am.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 3am.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was out in Ron's backyard with the dry
sift screens and the T5s.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had like 15 of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lighting up the whole back of his yard.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the trees looked like daytime back
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was pretty cold too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is definitely helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only when you're doing a single screen
extraction, but when you're... The last of
[SPEAKER_05]: John's fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only say ours because I narrated while
he made the whole batch and cleaned all
[SPEAKER_05]: the bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun when you get things down to really,
really pure and clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Little things like hair and dust and
debris can really jump in and affect
[SPEAKER_05]: things easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah yes, what's next then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice Hanoma and stuff here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all from Matt who just hit this.
[SPEAKER_05]: House of the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a little fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hanoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is his Afghan.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a big dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoked a lot of them, but now I've
smoked... Oh I haven't smoked yours yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm about to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've smoked Al's and I've smoked mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've smoked like two or three
varieties of Matt's.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's so many different flavors at
this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know what to try.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe this is the fresh frozen you said?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I should probably hit this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some of the last hash that John
and I made.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not on the boat, but in the back area when
we... We had that beautiful rose colored
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have been puffing on it like every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't bring it out and I figured I
would definitely bring the last little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of the 120.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of course the 90s have been gone
for probably three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, something just came in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sublimate on the right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa, you had to step up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to guess, go out on a limb and
say this is sublimate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the sublimator that Al the Alchemist
just put on He's very sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what sublimate is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: From like a hundred varieties of herb?
[SPEAKER_05]: All the herb you smoke on a daily basis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it tastes like just killer flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tastes like killer flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hard to say no to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let John step up to bat first.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know all the times I was like we'll
let John try this first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well you're the guest on the show,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go when you're ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sublimate.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is... Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the sublimator is this little
product right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful, unreal, long vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which you've seen me use before.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've seen John use before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Enrico Bouchard, who's the inventor,
is a real wild guy and an amazing
[SPEAKER_05]: character that we get to spend time with
often here in Vancouver when he visits and
[SPEAKER_05]: staying here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We spent time with him at the cannabis cup
this year and he's come up with this,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, kind of unbelievable way of
extracting using hot air the resin from
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not your everyday vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally like what guys like me and
Try Home Farmer and even Skunk Man Sam
[SPEAKER_05]: have been saying for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could only get like, you know,
like 50 or 100 of those volcano bags all
[SPEAKER_05]: put into one bag then that would be a good
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, you know, pretty much what the
sublimator is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course in the meantime it
makes this oil that is by far so medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I just kind of relax.
[SPEAKER_05]: While you're just hitting it, hitting the
sublimator, you're making oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of like the sublimator is
like bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really... The real product is the
thing you make.
[SPEAKER_05]: It puts the fun back in working.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was making resin and I just came here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's payback.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's payback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, have some grams of resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'll hit a little sublimate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Al's going to come rock us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm invading the set.
[SPEAKER_02]: He puts his sublimate on there and he
goes, because I don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you try this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I need to get high right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I'm getting high over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoked some really nice back push just
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, getting high over here too,
that does taste beautiful.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfection.
[SPEAKER_02]: How disgusting is a little contraption
that all of a sudden just... So nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blower sublimate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot air extracted and basically
recondensed in this stem, pulled out and
[SPEAKER_05]: puffed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not reclaimed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use a D-nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: It produces reclaimed and the stem here is
not the same stuff at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find that the D-nail and the sublimator
are stand-alone products that I don't even
[SPEAKER_05]: really compare.
[SPEAKER_05]: People ask me all the time which one I
like better and I find them different for
[SPEAKER_05]: different reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing I've learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the volcano for me gets me
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do a nice bag in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the nice little smooth
little... Little rip in the morning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I always have that bag sitting
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of nice when you get up in the
morning and you got a little bit of thing
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can plug that volcano in and come out of
the shower that's there and I kind of walk
[SPEAKER_02]: around with that bag and set it down when
I'm doing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the sublimator, of course it's
fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little fun things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, geez, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all this great hash on the table
and just hit the sublimate a couple times.
[SPEAKER_05]: What to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel it nicely baked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feeling like Mark Emory should be out of
jail and in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's in Vancouver right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm kind of feeling that right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how long it's been since the
US said that they would let him go if
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada accepted him.
[SPEAKER_05]: But wow, we should really be getting in
touch with the minister.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't look good upon the
government.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, come on, he's a Canadian.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's down in prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to keep him in jail,
keep him in jail, but do it up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring him up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let him finish his sentence up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sold seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's crazy that he could sell
seeds and be in jail in the US for five
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be good to have him back anyway in
July.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe he's scheduled to be released
regardless of Canada's inability to accept
[SPEAKER_05]: him from the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: He will be released in July, I believe
Jodie was saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be really good to have him
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure he'll be doing all the shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going for some Afghani?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: See how that does for pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently this was chosen by all the
members.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure nice looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always nice to bump into other hash
makers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt is one of the island hash makers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always got nice product.
[SPEAKER_05]: House of the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys definitely know what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got, in my opinion, a good
foundation.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're good people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing it for the right reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it shows in their end product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasty organic medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice, but coming April 1st I'm going
to have to take all of this and mix it
[SPEAKER_02]: with cow butter and water and put it over
my curry.
[SPEAKER_05]: What if we had a March 31st Bubble Man's
birthday bash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which just happens to actually be my
birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: March 31st.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could throw a party in Vancouver and
invite everyone down who has herb and hash
[SPEAKER_05]: that they need to destroy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll have a big destroy party.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's an awesome idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Epic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: John and I are going to finish a couple
more rips here, but we're going to end it
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might hear more about this big end of
the MMAR license bash with Bubble Man,
[SPEAKER_05]: John B., and many more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace, guys.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
