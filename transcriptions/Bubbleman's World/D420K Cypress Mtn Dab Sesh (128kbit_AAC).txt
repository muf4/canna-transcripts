[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with D420K and we're up at
Cypress Provincial Park Lookout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to hear a lot of cars
going by.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll probably see people in the
background over there sort of looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: this pretty beautiful city view in the
background in between D and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that the city of Vancouver is
back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably show you guys another little
glimpse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a video up here some time ago with
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might remember this view,
but we never actually sat down and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: did the session like we're going to do
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my new Plasma Mini battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a real nice little unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just turn that on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a check.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, she's live.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, so let's tell our story as we're
waiting for this to heat up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crazy story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a speeding ticket coming up the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did get a speeding ticket coming up the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a little excited coming up the
early part of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear these guys ripping because
what did the cop tell us after he gave us,
[SPEAKER_02]: first of all, he gave us a huge break.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were so much over the speed limit that
he could have impounded the bikes and
[SPEAKER_02]: given us a $400 ticket each.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas instead what he did was he gave us
$120 ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: $138 ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a discount on it if you paid it
early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he said it would be $120 or $125.
[SPEAKER_02]: No taking the bike, which was huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remembered this is my 2.0 D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, it should work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope this works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually only used this battery with
my Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't tried the D now on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's possible that if the electronics
are too powerful in here, too much wattage
[SPEAKER_02]: is needed and this isn't enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got this for the battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have the backup and hopefully this
will turn on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's just going to turn off
and it's not enough power.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally spaced that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been nice to... Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to 93.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's three degrees hotter than it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because I've had this problem
with my D now just not working with the
[SPEAKER_02]: batteries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what kind of electronics
they're putting in here, but they are good
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'll tell you, they pull so much
power that a giant battery like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't even basically heat up a nail
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you want to do the torchy action?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I did bring a couple of varieties
of nails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought that little titanium one that I
was showing you earlier, which is this guy
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I brought the banger as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got both the quartz and the
titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like the banger, the quartz,
just because that's what I like the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to set it up and start getting it
going here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to get this going eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems as though if I want to use my
battery, I'm going to have to bring my
[SPEAKER_02]: dabinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be the tool for the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: This D nail just doesn't seem to want to
run off of a battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until those guys get that organized,
I think I'll probably just stick with my
[SPEAKER_02]: dabinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thus the reason we have a quartz
quiver of these tools in our arsenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you never know when one might not
be able to get the trick done while the
[SPEAKER_02]: other one simply can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you having a good time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got the quartz banger in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got all sorts of varieties here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to hit some rosin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd like to hit some rosin dipped in
my harmony dry silt.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me pull something out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this harmony dry silt, I had such a
problem with my stuff turning into caking
[SPEAKER_01]: out when I'd come down to the coast
because of the moisture, right?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then we were on Haas Church there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked a Cuban grower and yourself,
what's the deal with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How come it cakes out like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, you've got to cure it for
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, get it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I did is I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cured it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even I brought it down here in my
pocket on my motorbike, all the way down
[SPEAKER_01]: from Prince George to back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still nothing but sandy,
beautifulness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the difference on the cure big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of denailage for the denail.
[SPEAKER_02]: D-Man minus the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been having quite the time with this
battery thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was so excited to finally get this
going with the battery and be able to show
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys, I got a battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: The denail works on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so sorry that the denail does not
work on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But next time you see me and I'm out and
about, I'm going to have my Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And big shout out to Maximillian for
producing a unit that it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: different from denail.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll tell you, the unit works on both
UK power, European power, and Canadian
[SPEAKER_02]: power.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also works on this battery for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll continue to troubleshoot with
denail, because I, of course, love to
[SPEAKER_02]: support those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a tasty rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better set that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm definitely down for one of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nice to have the torches,
the backup, which is what I told you to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of knew what was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already had it, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the rosin dipped in full-melt dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: The holy grail melts, you know,
that top-grade full-melt bubble hash or
[SPEAKER_02]: full-melt dry sift, 99.9% heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really hard to beat, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really hard to beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I'll give it a little second
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm learning this culture of, you know,
feeling the nail with my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say, I still am not good enough
at it that I really appreciate the denail
[SPEAKER_02]: for that reason, where I just know the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention, also, when people watch
this video, they'll notice that whenever
[SPEAKER_02]: the torch gets lit, it dilutes the sound
of our voices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't hear the stories that we're
trying to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The torch, you know, is a bit of a pain in
the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to brace them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a beautiful hit for me,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one thing I've seen guys do and
it was the, I think it was the Van City
[SPEAKER_01]: extract, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Q-tip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were doing, they put their
iPhone on the timer and time it 45 seconds
[SPEAKER_01]: after they got to crisp the quartz red or
orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time it 45 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hit them do their hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some do 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some do 25, 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice, cooler hit and, you know,
that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, if you really wanted to get
tactical, grab one of those little laser
[SPEAKER_01]: pointer things that does the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch what the temperature drops to after
that 45 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why I want to invent a torch
that has that built into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're just torching with a little LED
readout and it tells you when the thing
[SPEAKER_02]: has reached the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: You turn your torch off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do a double check.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're at the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hit right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the idea of waiting to have a
hit, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And wasting your butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wasting the butane when you don't have
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm so glad that our bikes are still
here and not impounded.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We always hear the stories about the bad
cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're here to tell you today that
Darren and I dealt with a pretty decent
[SPEAKER_02]: cop.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had zero attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was zero suspicious of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could have easily ran our names and
found out we both had felony records.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just was decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he gave us a break on a $400 ticket
and he didn't impound our vehicles for
[SPEAKER_02]: seven days at $70 a day, which is another
like $400, $500.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it ends up being a $1,000 pinch when
they give you that ticket and they take
[SPEAKER_02]: your vehicle away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of that happening, Dee and I
each got a $120 pinch and five minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: later we're sitting at this table enjoying
some bowls of some beautiful rosin and dry
[SPEAKER_02]: sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta like the way that worked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what people think when they drive
by on their bicycles and they just happen
[SPEAKER_02]: to be walking by and they see this big
tattooed bearded guy with a blowtorch in
[SPEAKER_02]: his hand heating up a fatty piece of
glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope what they think is, damn son,
I think that's D420K and Bubble Man
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting the mothership over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should head on over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you should, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see us in public and we're filming
a Bubble Man's episode and you just kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of recognize us for whatever reason,
absolutely come right over, interrupt and
[SPEAKER_02]: become a part of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely wouldn't say no to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've taken guys right back to my
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I'm so big.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even know their name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I met them on the SkyTrain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were yelling at me down the street
one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: D420K out the window in traffic right in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on Canada Day, I'm on the
SkyTrain and the same guys that were
[SPEAKER_01]: yelling at me go, hey, D420K, we're the
guys that were yelling at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you're the only guys that have
done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, where are you going?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, to the commercial drive one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, we're going there
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you want to get baked?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got them peeled on the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fucking loved it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that for a word?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love doing that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got them peeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he says that, I really do believe
they were peeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps if you were the guys that D420K
peeled out that day, feel free to leave a
[SPEAKER_02]: comment in the comment section and let us
know your side of the story and how things
[SPEAKER_02]: went and how peeled you actually were
because I bet you he's downplaying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were really peeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's something I just got at.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long was that that I was telling that
story after I heated that up and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe like 30 seconds, 40 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the taste of that low temp dab was
fucking phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That rosin and the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I love the low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the intensity of a hotter rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the idea of producing a rip that is
both of those things, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the best of both of those things and
neither of the lesser parts of those
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Truck going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already condensed quite a little bit
of rippage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go for some of this crazy
reddish purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some seriously looking fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tasty too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I squeezed some rosin out of it and it is
absolutely just freaking ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you can't even like touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you I could squeeze rosin out of it
with my fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you a hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be like, I can feel it on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just touching it leaves a clear,
oily residual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty nice and cooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to back it up with one of these
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, the motorbike is so shiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels nice when you pick it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so great when you leave the place
and then get a ticket, but who would have
[SPEAKER_02]: known that that guy was a police officer
following behind us from like miles back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing a buck 40 on the freeway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fucking ripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cruising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then up the hill, fucking just being
fucking kids on bikes, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not obeying the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily being dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just maybe going just a little bit over
the speed limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, well we got caught as,
uh, as generally we do when we do things
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, normally I would dispute tickets
and stuff because it's, it's the thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: do just in case the cops on vacation or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing they do these days is they pay
cops double time now to go to court and to
[SPEAKER_01]: test and have to go like that because
before in the old days you disputed and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes the cops would be off duty and
they'd be like, I'm not going in on that
[SPEAKER_01]: day and fucking wasting my day off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just wouldn't show up for court.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking no ticket, no point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happened quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that Ducati again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing is insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a fucking bullet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You were telling the story about,
uh, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to fucking laugh at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have to rewind cause they won't
know what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many potheads does it take to screw
the light bulb?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think we're all fucking
stupid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cause we smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to finish it off with one more
ripper because I should burn off D for 20
[SPEAKER_02]: K's residuals here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke those off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's nice about ports.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it so nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a nice view from up here,
especially for like fireworks or any of
[SPEAKER_02]: that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let that cool off a little bit before I
rip it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it really as clean as I would
have liked to.
[SPEAKER_01]: How hot is fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the laser pointer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for anybody out there that's concerned
about us smoking and riding, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to sit here for another four or five
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be here for a long time.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to watch the sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might share it with you guys if you're
lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Battery time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can plug that battery into yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well fucking a that was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good little Cypress poles rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanted to fucking give you guys a video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't given you guys one for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
Yeah, bro.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
