[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, give thanks for life, give thanks for
the timing, give thanks for all great
[SPEAKER_00]: things on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now a horizontal move in terms of
Jamaica legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a joy for us to partner with
foreign investors, especially from UK and
[SPEAKER_00]: from the bubba man, working together to
get this thing properly done in our
[SPEAKER_00]: island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is it a great financial benefit
to individuals involved, but it brings
[SPEAKER_00]: forth great financial benefit for people
of the nation, which is very and most
[SPEAKER_00]: important to these people who are here
with us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Richie, it's just a joy for me to be
here with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's a joy being here right now,
right in Blue Mountain, drinking a little
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Mr. Sears here and our team from
out of Canada, representing for the music
[SPEAKER_01]: and the herbs, you know, good herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me answer to the fullest, because you
see right now, you see, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the herbs right now and the music
together, you know, it's a great venture,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a great development right now,
because, you know, it can only do good for
[SPEAKER_01]: the people, you know, I mean, physically,
mentally, spiritually, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, I mean, you know, this vibration
right now, you know, if right now we have
[SPEAKER_01]: our herbs and, you know, we have the best,
one of the best herbs, the best herbs in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world right now, come from right here
in Kingstown, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I mean, right now, you need to
be get out there, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so a lot of people can, you know,
get implied and, you know, send them kids
[SPEAKER_01]: to school and, you know, you know,
create jobs, you know, the music likewise
[SPEAKER_01]: said speed, you know, the music and the
herbs go together, you know, in a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination, brothers and sisters,
you know, so it's just a one love vibe and
[SPEAKER_01]: a good vibes right now, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.
[SPEAKER_00]: From you say cannabis and you say herb,
you say reggae music and Rich is all about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's why our combination with
each other, being working together as
[SPEAKER_00]: partners, not even no management,
because, you know, we don't really endorse
[SPEAKER_00]: that aspect, the two tough, we love work
together as partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Together as partners and team.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teamwork, you know, yeah.
Team.
[SPEAKER_01]: A brotherly love vibe, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: For real.
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.
[SPEAKER_00]: For real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and just like how we work
together, that's how we are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in the item from Canada,
work together from Colorado, River Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are doing some tremendous work
outside the world, which we see from afar
[SPEAKER_00]: and we appreciate it and we love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Jamaica, everybody love the vibe,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been out and hopefully we'll go back
out into some fields and you can't say
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teaching the grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stood out important to me when the
bubble man was out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and John teaching people, educating
our local farmers and growers of the herb,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it can be done with their knowledge
combined with your knowledge, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should get a positive meditation
because as you and I know, Peter Tosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Marley, all of them, you name it,
they've been singing about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Richie was pioneering this movement as the
younger generation of Rasta Firehands who
[SPEAKER_00]: at one point in time, they wouldn't play
marijuana on the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't play music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even videoed up till now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even videoed because of the
fight we must have got within that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody would have videoed it much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never want to play it, Richie.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have to give thanks to RFM
who go out of their way and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear me, I could play this song because
the world needs to hear it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Richie has been an advocate for the
herb since, since the beginning of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since about time, until this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're going to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, because you know that,
you know, it's a good thing and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: good plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plant where I really meditate and
wonder at times, you know, why is it that
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant gets so many fights,
you know, and people fight against this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant so much where in which means it's
just a herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like any other tree, you know,
just like where we have like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a lot of herb tree right now in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have for different, different use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have aloe vera, you know, you have many
type of trees, bush, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we would call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the herbs now, you know, we really
wonder why, you know, people really fight
[SPEAKER_01]: the herbs so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where in which mean it give us more time
now to look in it and check and realize
[SPEAKER_01]: something must good about it because only
good things a person would fight against.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, rebel against, you know,
so we get to understand that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a, it's a plant that, you know,
it's the king of the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, it's the king of the
forest and it's a plant that have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning and have a lot of use,
you know, and the more I learn about this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, I learn to know, I get to learn
that it carry this pharma medicine within
[SPEAKER_01]: it where in which it heal a lot of people
worldwide, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess probably if them free it up and
legalize it and thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those like pharmaceutical and all
these things, you know, don't have to take
[SPEAKER_01]: them out of the shelf because,
you know, this would come and replace
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so when you check back now,
you really check the measurement and check
[SPEAKER_01]: the ratio of things and get to understand,
you know, that is the reason why they
[SPEAKER_01]: fight against this tree so much,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then come to find out, say,
within one's human being structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the cannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning all about these things,
it really enhance our knowledge to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand, say, certain areas of the
plant, the trichomes, the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC, you know, where we as Jamaicans
and we as a people, as a people need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are talking about the educational
aspect of growing and learning about
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana from the universities,
from CASE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come right back to you, to NCU.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'd like everybody to take it
on the scientific level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, say, there's great opportunities
and there's great medicinal value for this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which we continue to hold back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though there are some federal
governments who say, yeah, free it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still having problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what is free?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what is free to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to thank the Jamaican
government for making such a positive step
[SPEAKER_00]: and we trust within the policy element
that it will continue to move forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: where it ought to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: To where it ought to be because,
you know, herb is not about just smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about smoking and smoking and
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herb, herb way beyond that, way beyond
that, way beyond that to save cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was richly singing to him, saying,
you know, we use the herb for more than
[SPEAKER_01]: one reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to tell you too, it's not,
you know, the music make a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, shoes, said speed, soap,
you know, roll on, you know, a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like it serve a whole heap of
different purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we can't just name a few,
but there's a whole lot of things out
[SPEAKER_01]: there which mean, you know, it can use
for, you know, and it's a thing that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: meta that I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: We right now as Jamaican, you know,
we definitely, we need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our economy and all these things right
now, we need it because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we still have to go back again to,
you know, providing jobs for people
[SPEAKER_01]: because right now in Jamaica, it's really
rough, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really rough because, I mean, you know,
the economy is very low, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you find that people suffer right
here, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only herbs can free it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the herbs can free it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only cannabis can free it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GDP, the balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trade, you know, right now we're in a
horrible deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the herbs can create the export
increase there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, see?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'm saying, Richie, the man will
grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll get a donation for his work inside
of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll now turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trickle down effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll turn and he'll decide, say,
I'm going to the next room in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll go to the hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardware store man now send him kids
to go to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a trickle down effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great to know that all the
ministers of Jamaica have realized that
[SPEAKER_00]: and have stepped on it in this format,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't do that now, with the
right people, which is most important,
[SPEAKER_00]: because nobody must just feel so they can
come to Jamaica and sing and come
[SPEAKER_00]: grab-a-licious this movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we won't allow that as a people
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as my partner always say, you know,
we're careful of the suits because we are
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that bubble, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we keep that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the energy there, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the energy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the energy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a good vibe and it's a good
movement, you know, to see the ministers
[SPEAKER_01]: arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, make a move towards it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just looking right now forward
towards it for the greater part of it
[SPEAKER_01]: right now and, you know, until it just
free up, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're in which mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just free up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free up, because His Majesty couldn't say
it any clearer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a big nation is a first world nation,
think them can do it out of a small nation
[SPEAKER_00]: like Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have problems inside of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to come together as a people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get race, class, creed, and color,
come together in one soul, one harmony,
[SPEAKER_00]: for one objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mission is use cannabis to enhance
the welfare of the entire human race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we say at CID.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just basically our view.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta.
