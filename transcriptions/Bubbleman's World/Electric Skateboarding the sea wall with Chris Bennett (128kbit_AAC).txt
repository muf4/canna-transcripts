I tell you the way the rest of men consume
[SPEAKER_03]: the meditation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bind to CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get number 9, receptors in the brain and
body.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happiness for me and you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the TNC, tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it's from the CBD, cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get with the cancer finale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to perfection.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the MEDICAL, medical cannabis in this
sick patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: MEDICAL, put the cannabis on the pharmacy
shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis can make it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do without the stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's plant up many many acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: To all of the organic farmers,
I'm on a two mile risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they come into my area,
I treat them like a case.
[SPEAKER_03]: The men in the office, they talk about
them all the days.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a jacket and brilliant pants and shirts
and a couple of footpanties.
[SPEAKER_03]: They never come out dirty, but they can
linger yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they make the money, you're not
really getting paid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to perfection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking in the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the sweet trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the stump we get the full melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dyson for the rising.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the sweet trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like a good spot for a sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure mine does too, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you tell?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to tell with that one,
but I think you still got a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: left too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely feels like I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only got four minutes left on the
camera, but we got the puff go out here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the seawall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're pretty much there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's our selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Lost Gardens, West Coast
Collective, Maple Butter, and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more Lost Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the puff go going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect landing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'll tell you, it's perfect right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puff go peak for the win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well let me get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: West Coast Bubble Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: AK-47 from Lost Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acapulco Gold from Lost Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some CBD Isolate with some ACDC
terpenes from Our Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I'm going to hit this twice,
get it vibrating, and have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: session here with Mr. Bennett here on the
seawall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty good spot actually,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right across from Science World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really on the cusp of East
Van and downtown Vancouver, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at this, a little electric bike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is going to vibrate soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as I questioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little bit of Acapulco Gold mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me clean that out and get one ready
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One whole minute for Chris to get his dab
in and for us to be done this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to get your dab in
and as you exhale it, it'll start playing
[SPEAKER_00]: the bubble man music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puff go peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Convenient, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been giving hate on this unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, I've been loving mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm taking it all the fuck over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely not babying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the battery until it's all done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm puffing tough with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitting the 20 plus dabs that we get out
of it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less conspicuous than a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a torch is too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we'll call it a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Bennett, bubble man signing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everybody.
Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
