[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Bubble Man here today to talk to you
about Fresh Heady's brand new product
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Bubble Bags Lite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bubble Bags Lite is a reply to the
marketplace being created around the
[SPEAKER_00]: high-end original bubble bags,
which I'll speak to you a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: later, which are pretty much one of the
highest grade levels of extractors that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can purchase, warranty, lifetime,
parachute thread, the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created a fairly expensive product that
not everyone was able to afford into,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we created a marketplace where a lot of
companies were selling cheaper inferior
[SPEAKER_00]: bags, and unfortunately in the corners
that they cut to get those cheaper prices,
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects were felt by the end user in
the lack of quality, in the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential workability or usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the bag straight up didn't work,
sometimes the screens were in the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: order, sometimes the materials used were
extremely cheap and threads came apart and
[SPEAKER_00]: other things came apart, so you basically
ended up with a product that you were not
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Bubble Bags Lite is a reply to
that, a reply to the marketplace that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been created around the higher-end bubble
bags original in order to release a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that the end user can afford,
first of all, and be able to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: world of water extraction, get into trying
it and experimenting with it without
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I want to talk to you first of
all about the five-gallon, eight-bag kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar with bubble bags,
we sell generally eight-bag kits in all
[SPEAKER_00]: our sizes, which are one-gallon,
five-gallon, and 20-gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all come with eight bags,
but we also do four-bag kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've discontinued our threes,
but we sell individual bags so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: make any kit that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to these bubble bag lights,
five-gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things I did right off
the bat, I can show you, I have an
[SPEAKER_00]: original set of bubble bags here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of a more expensive
fabric material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's softer and thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is quite a bit thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right off the bat, I thought what a
great way to cut costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still make it a carry case, still allow it
to hold the bags, and so you can carry it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but cut the costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't affect the quality of the end
product that is being used to make the,
[SPEAKER_00]: with these bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was step one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step two, which was a fairly big step.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar with the original
bubble bags, there's eight colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got them right here, the originals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue, the 220 micron bag, the green 190
bag, the red 160 micron bag, the orange
[SPEAKER_00]: 120 micron bag, the black 90 micron bag,
the yellow 73, the white 45, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly expensive to buy cloth for all
those colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly exhaustive investment,
and I was able to cut some corners and
[SPEAKER_00]: save a little bit of money by with the
bubble bag lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, the main reason I did this,
I was able to cut the colors down and only
[SPEAKER_00]: release three colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these particular, the lights are always
going to be red, white, and blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those three colors in eight bags will
still represent these original colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how I did that was, if you notice,
the work bag is a 220, and you can open it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's actually inside out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a band on the bottom of each bag
and the thread as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably can't see it, but I have
photos of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thread is blue and the band on the
bottom of the bag is also blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this blue band signifies the original
work bag, which I just showed you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: original bubble bags, which is a 220
micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our 220 bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move into the next bag is a white bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next four bags are going to be white.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the 190 through to the
90 micron, and each one is going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: that same original piping of the original
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 190 original bag is green,
green piping, green threading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red for the 160, orange for the 120,
black for the 90, and so on into the last
[SPEAKER_00]: three bags, which are blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the 73, the 45, and the 25,
so they're going to be yellow,
[SPEAKER_00]: white, and purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It correlates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always liked the bubble bags that it had
both the micron sizes, but it also had the
[SPEAKER_00]: color coordinated thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always a nice bonus, and it's for
sure people are still going to always want
[SPEAKER_00]: to, that are serious about the game,
always go with the original bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those that really want to
experiment and get into this game without
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting your end product, you're still
going to make as nice of a product as you
[SPEAKER_00]: would with the bubble bag originals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just won't be getting the lifetime
warranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's those in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also going to be receiving three
pressing screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in these little books,
pads, whatever envelopes you want to call
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and you open that up and you'll have
a 25 micron pressing screen with a band
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way around, and that folds in
half, and that's how we dab the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't want to cut corners so bad
that I gave you a lesser product,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why I'm still giving you three
pressing screens, because it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important part of the process to dry it
and to get it properly opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely was going to make sure
that three of those went into every kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
