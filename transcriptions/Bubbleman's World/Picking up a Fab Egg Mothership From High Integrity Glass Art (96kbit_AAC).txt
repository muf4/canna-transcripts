Marcel is a fab egg Yes, and one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorites for sure This one is I said the
name of this and got attacked by like 800
[SPEAKER_02]: people on my youtube channel What did I
call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I called it the exosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's a ball exo a ball exo Okay,
we heard it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a ball expo exo.
[SPEAKER_02]: He he believes so please don't attack us
if you are Slightly more obsessed about
[SPEAKER_02]: this than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people very Obsessed like we had
somewhat the first actually kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so Scott called him an FTK I was at
the shop when he pulled him out I was
[SPEAKER_01]: probably because it was the order that
they were all put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and now apparently they're called
FKT's and Some kid was going at me for a
[SPEAKER_01]: little while about it saying like well,
you know You should know the name man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you find one you should know Well,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a little glimpse of it when we
were in Whistler and you had everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: went at the table and it was Aaron and
yourself and that cool Mike from Pemberton
[SPEAKER_02]: and Christian well Christian is into this
like he had an in-depth like he was just
[SPEAKER_02]: like You could tell that he spends a good
amount of time researching it focusing on
[SPEAKER_02]: it and it's it's a serious It's a serious
way of collecting people Christian has the
[SPEAKER_02]: love for sure He's got I'd say he's got
the obsession and I don't say that as a
[SPEAKER_02]: negative Christian keep up your obsession.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a it's it's contagious and here I am
buying a mothership egg, so Should we pull
[SPEAKER_02]: it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty exciting pretty exciting So yeah,
you guys these as you know are fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to find I've been looking for
one for probably three months and I know
[SPEAKER_02]: these guys I know these guys and I've been
looking for one of these for three months
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't looking very far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just looking for them to get me one
and here it is Here's one so I guess we
[SPEAKER_02]: better open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's very exciting It's always nice
when more mothership joins as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: You know heading off to other parts of BC
or Alberta, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I feel that even though,
you know Probably end up hitting those
[SPEAKER_01]: ones, too Yeah, well, I'm gonna do
something will come by and actually bring
[SPEAKER_02]: it for you to hit so it's possible I like
the idea that this particular piece will
[SPEAKER_02]: be a very very very well traveled
mothership It'll be internationally
[SPEAKER_02]: traveled it'll probably be going to
Jamaica at the end of the month and if it
[SPEAKER_02]: does it will be celebrating Bob Marthley's
70th birthday party down at 56 Hope Road
[SPEAKER_02]: That's of course the house to be purchased
off of Chris Blackwell when he kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: started making it He really wanted to own
that house and that's actually the house
[SPEAKER_02]: that he he ended his life in He didn't
pass in that exact house, but he lived
[SPEAKER_02]: there right up Until the time he passed
away Yeah, so that's 56 Hope Road and I
[SPEAKER_02]: was really excited to see recently that my
buddies the Nomads got Basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are one of three Bob Marley
ambassadors for the 70th anniversary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got Kronix Obviously Kronix is
one of the top names in reggae music right
[SPEAKER_02]: now Kabaka pyramid also really really
powerful lyricist and conscious reggae
[SPEAKER_02]: artist and then finally the Nomads which I
was really really stoked for man is this
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give that a little gentle
[SPEAKER_02]: The thinner mouth stems are nice man is
that nice really really sweet Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty excited to slam a d-nail into
this now Dave and I we are federally
[SPEAKER_02]: exempt obviously, so we are able to give
it a little shot and What an unbelievable
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful little piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still excited about clear ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I mean I really am I'm not even
joking There's only so many of these yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the level of precision and perfection
like we were talking about Function yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: everything like yeah, every single one is
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not it doesn't leave the shop
Yeah, it is perfect like the level of
[SPEAKER_01]: precision the level of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's second to none anywhere I mean,
they're the Rolls-Royce This is a very
[SPEAKER_02]: like perfect I mean I appreciate you guys
for having these and I love the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: collectors are out there and they're
giving the You know, they're putting the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of money in that that in a sense
Well, whether you want to think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: deserved or not, obviously Mothership and
some other artists out there have taken
[SPEAKER_02]: this art form to the next level where in
our society how we usually acknowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: that is in the rising of prices and I mean
you guys have very much so these got to be
[SPEAKER_02]: two of the most beautiful Motherships on
the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they've got a fair amount of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really this is I'm just happy that I
can come visit you guys And have a rip on
[SPEAKER_02]: these every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well since we enjoy sharing them so much
with quality people It's always a pleasure
[SPEAKER_01]: to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'd be more nervous traveling
international borders too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I would say so like this Just roll
into Barcelona or Jamaica You should have
[SPEAKER_01]: seen the look on the on the custom guards
faces when I came back with the with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Radium FTK and they were like Okay,
so because I said like they were like do
[SPEAKER_01]: you use this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, it's fully used but it's
clean And they're like it's clean because
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what happens if it's not clean,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, yeah, you guys will arrest
me You'll confiscate that I'll never see
[SPEAKER_01]: it again They're like, yeah, that's right
And they're like, so yeah still though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, it's cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cleaned It's all good But then after
they took it away and swapped it and did
[SPEAKER_01]: all their things They started talking to
me about it and like the value of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things and like how they're made and all
that kind of stuff Yeah, I had a good
[SPEAKER_01]: hour-long conversation with the border
guards about the glass world I'm glad that
[SPEAKER_02]: it came to that you were able to get
through get all your pipes back into
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada and just have no real experiences
because that would have been that must
[SPEAKER_02]: have been Are really hard for you because
he didn't have one piece or two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: or four I'm pretty sure he had nine or ten
super Super any pieces that you take over
[SPEAKER_01]: the border not as heavy as the sublimator
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true the real reason that the
sublimator Ruhr take first place over
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces of this Quality is a simple fact
that it's the only piece in the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: competition That everyone's hitting the
whole cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's and this year the cup was cancelled
Yeah, so it was it was even more so the
[SPEAKER_02]: only place that people could go was to the
greenhouse Try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it was and as the damp ring
gallery is a little Step back because it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have the exposure that a coffee
shop would because you're going to the
[SPEAKER_01]: gallery You're going to see art.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to buy something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna go and look at the pipes
You're gonna go and look at the teachers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have this the hang,
but no Yeah, exactly the like the constant
[SPEAKER_01]: walk through, you know, but other than
that, I mean we actually did I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: was great I think the damp ring was in a
position that they could have become even
[SPEAKER_02]: more They could you know, they will yeah,
I think the cup this year not to get
[SPEAKER_02]: off-topic but It was almost like an old
90s cup because of the way it was broken
[SPEAKER_02]: up and because there was no main venue It
was like oh you could go to all these
[SPEAKER_02]: little shops It would have been cool if
all the people who had booths were able to
[SPEAKER_02]: go and get and set up in a coffee shop so
if you had like Soma and myself and a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple others in amnesia You know what I'm
saying, and then you just have a list you
[SPEAKER_02]: have your you have your little because
Nowadays we know that the herb itself
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't enough to bring the people to each
shop But if you had like hitman at this
[SPEAKER_02]: place you had so much this place You had
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of these you check over here
exactly, you know Emu tech held it down at
[SPEAKER_02]: the noon and that was pretty cool Those
guys were really pretty much the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did one little video there and it was
good Yeah I pretty much want to get this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing watered up and do a little water
test show you guys a close-up video of
[SPEAKER_02]: that and Maybe we'll have a little
session.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we might have to Thanks,
dude Okey-dokey well session time indeed
[SPEAKER_02]: clear egg Dude, I'm telling you break it
in break the cherry You can feel this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing rumble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh it does like it when you put your
fingers just on the bottom of the base
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an actual Emotion to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the glass almost wants to move
when you Chubble it up, so pretty excited
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta say I brought some hash,
but jeez you guys you have so much hash
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might as well hit a little bit of it
Well, what do we got here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little patty just got handed to me,
so I'm gonna have to Hit that we got the D
[SPEAKER_02]: nail turned up to 738 got the Peking bee
quartz bowl with the 16 millimeter I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: hit the 16 very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very small, but this dab would be
perfect For that so here we go breaking in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Faberge egg high-integrity glass art
If you guys if you're in BC, or you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: Alberta or Western Manitoba, I mean
There's a high demand in limited
[SPEAKER_01]: availability, but always contact us if you
are interested in getting a hold of some
[SPEAKER_02]: other show I Can attest these guys can
hold it down oh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow I really like that that's incredible
look at one little little bit of reclaim
[SPEAKER_02]: already on my Well that tasted really good
And I know people are gonna ask me so what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do is all I'll write it in the
comments When I find out what it was it It
[SPEAKER_02]: was a little Congo esque chemo esque
[SPEAKER_02]: And Congo there you go wonderful the The
combination of those two I think can only
[SPEAKER_02]: be a win-win of course I was lucky enough
to check out Remos sweet skunk the other
[SPEAKER_02]: day in fact I brought in that little pouch
right there Remos buds if you guys want to
[SPEAKER_02]: roll yourself up a joint or if you just
want to look through them and smell them
[SPEAKER_02]: those were grown with Remos nutrients Hmm
cool and a lot of people asking if Remos
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients are organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say absolutely not However,
I have to say all the stuff that I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: Used from Remos whether it's been
vaporized or made dry sift or made wet
[SPEAKER_02]: washed It's been on point, so you know I
of course I'm a bit of a purist I do
[SPEAKER_02]: prefer Organic outdoor sun-grown tropical
Jamaican residential, but that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that that's all I ever hear I know
that years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a sweet skunk outdoor crop done
and it was Unfortunately not flushed and
[SPEAKER_02]: so it was beautiful sweet skunk bud But
when you rolled it up and tried to burn it
[SPEAKER_02]: I would burn the very black ash so I took
the same Material almost a pound of it and
[SPEAKER_02]: turned it into some really lovely hash and
the hash smoked with a white ash
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what I'm saying is that through my
own bioassay my own hyper awareness I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: very sensitive like if someone with a
cigarette I would feel ill Speaking of
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who smokes cigarettes I can and
trying to quit but me and Mark travel
[SPEAKER_01]: often and When I smoke 20 minutes later
I'll come into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been 20 minutes 20 minutes for sure
no one else can smell a thing and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been outside the whole time Totally and
wear your jacket with a sweater,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll take my jacket off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll sit down next to Mark He can still
smell so I will definitely attest to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you my olfactory has been off
the chain for a long long time It's pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: hyper intensive That thing rips
wonderfully it really does I mean I'm I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty excited about this
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what it's good that There's a
company like high integrity glass art
[SPEAKER_02]: who's bringing it to BC because so many
people want this trust me on this guys
[SPEAKER_02]: There are enough people down in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_02]: That want this that if mothership and
Scott Deppie Weren't you know decided they
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't want to send them up to Canada they
could easily get rid of them down in the u
[SPEAKER_02]: .s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's very generous that a I'm
stoked that these guys have created a
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship with mothership and Done good
enough business and had a good enough
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship that they continue to send
These beautiful pieces up here It's very
[SPEAKER_01]: fair it is but I mean also like Like
there's a love for the art a love for the
[SPEAKER_01]: artists a true appreciation for the art
itself, which is why you know like prices
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't hyper exaggerated or overextended
to the point you know worth where Where
[SPEAKER_01]: some like online internet sales and stuff
like that some sometimes it can be like
[SPEAKER_01]: that But you know so there's like a love
and appreciation both ways between the
[SPEAKER_02]: artists and us Well I'm completely baked
the battery is about to die I've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: brand new fab egg and I just want to say
thanks guys and you'll be seeing a lot
