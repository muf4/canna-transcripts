[SPEAKER_01]: Action.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am down here at Eaton, the vapor lounge
in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say one of the premier vapor
lounges in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got ourselves a mothership ball
rig that we've rented from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're about to do a little dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta love mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Eaton if you're in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely worth the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
Thanks for watching.
