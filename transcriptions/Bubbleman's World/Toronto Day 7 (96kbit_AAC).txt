[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, John, that was a whirlwind trip,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our last day in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sorry we didn't get to film as much
as we wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just across the street from our
hotel and we're with our buddies who we
[SPEAKER_00]: linked up with here that are going to be
definitely, you're going to be hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: more from in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: John and I are super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: To potentially have this opportunity to
work with them and it involves a little
[SPEAKER_00]: island in the Caribbean called Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be more on that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to give too much up,
but watch Bubble Man's World for some
[SPEAKER_00]: serious Jamaican footage coming in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, John, I guess it's head to the
airport, have a session and get on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a good week and hey,
new adventures to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: New adventures to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for watching us on Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome back to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: John and I unfortunately didn't film our
entire journey back from Toronto,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're back in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Vancouver, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only are we in Vancouver,
but we have tracked down the owner of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Med Tamer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's even in the camera right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't think he is, but he's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in and we're going to give him the
camera back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike, my neighbor jumped out of the
truck, dropped his Med Tamer, kicked it by
[SPEAKER_01]: accident, probably, and this rolled into
the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a hypothesis because we really
don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is this yours?
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, it's purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you recognize it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many joints do you have, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some loose stuff in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, I gave one away to a
gentleman that truly, truly needed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that joint was very similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy was crying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to give him one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we gave the guy who was crying a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lit this one just out of good faith and
wanted to try whatever was in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't recognize his own weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently it was mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, let's give it back to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I found it, but he picked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was walking and I saw the Med Tamer and
I thought you guys were playing a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he had no idea because he didn't
believe that you had left the truck when
[SPEAKER_00]: you dropped him off to go in the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think he went in the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't know and I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have figured out the mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our good friend Mike who had the Med
Tamer full of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Med Tamer came with us to Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to share a joint or two with
some people that were in definite need.
[SPEAKER_00]: John got to puff half a joint and now I
think they've all been replaced,
[SPEAKER_00]: have they not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you roll a couple others?
[SPEAKER_01]: I rolled one in there from a nice
gentleman that had me a nice butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you roll the chocolate tie?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should... And then we brought you some
of this too, Mike, because we forgive you
[SPEAKER_01]: about what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Share the love and you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Share the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little nugget.
[SPEAKER_00]: John likes to pretend to pass containers
and then hold on to them when you put your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that?
[SPEAKER_01]: He came used to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to celebrate here coming
back to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me Mike back because he's like,
ooh.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to hook Mike up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great guy drives my truck to the... Well,
I drive myself to the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: He drives my truck home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drives to the airport with my truck to
give me my truck so I can drive home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly than that,
he's taking care of your garden while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was really nice that he was able
to look after the garden that I have just
[SPEAKER_01]: stood outside for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you do if you had no one to
take care of your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be not having any vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be no herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike grows amazing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, he even makes nice treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had them on the way down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: He shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shows up with an array of baked goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you get that?
[SPEAKER_01]: A neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the gardener-baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because you're a gardener and a
baker, but a different variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've taught Mike a lot of my gardening
skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Mike's transferring it into growing
awesome food.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a small space too, eh?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw your garden out back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got peppers already this big and it's
not even the May long week that just
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, Mike's ahead of the game right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got their food on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's actually going to garden my
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to garden your backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's the local gardener now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a Facebook thing called My
Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go to My Garden on Facebook,
you'll be able to see a lot of what Mike's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we've told you, you're going
to have to start updating more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're all about teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're just talking about Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has My Garden and we have the
cannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have water extraction and drying
techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have dry sifting, which I always say 50
Sundays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all these educational things
we have out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chronic Pain and Pharma Free is another
great educational site that is run by a
[SPEAKER_01]: group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, there you go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some full hits here happening with the,
I'm loving my little Ruhr Dabber that I
[SPEAKER_00]: got from Martin in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the glass dabbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been a big fan of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw these ones, I thought those
were way too breakable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it for about a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been carrying it around with me in my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ended up in my back pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They almost took it away at airport
security, but they didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I convinced them that, well, that I needed
it to dab my hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called it my stuff and I remember the
security guy going, your stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, my hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You going to get a rip of this,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was fun as we actually came here
with Toronto and Mark got through the
[SPEAKER_01]: security line really quickly, but I did
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason being is because in front
of me was a bunch of family and they had
[SPEAKER_01]: all their baby bottles and juice bottles
and they got searched and they got their
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff taken apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best part about this whole thing
is after everybody was searched in front
[SPEAKER_01]: of me, all my bags went through.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy behind me goes, I go, you know
what the funny thing is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was opening up my suitcase full of weed
until the guy with all the weed got
[SPEAKER_01]: through with no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people beside me were just like,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dab of the barb, the award
winning barb that took first place for
[SPEAKER_00]: Solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you get a little nip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a little nipper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite a good event.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chaps treating yourself excellent when
they treat yourself cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really nice that actually a
friend of ours, Redbeard, blew all the
[SPEAKER_01]: cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: This cup was won by a friend of mine for
growing, well, he grew us Super Lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from Greenhouse Seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the seed company came from Greenhouse
Seeds, but the grower was Hempman and he
[SPEAKER_01]: did a fabulous job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually went up on stage to accept
the award on behalf of Hempman and
[SPEAKER_01]: involved Greenhouse Seeds for their seed
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Redbeard did a really good job with
the cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really nice to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get a custom horse, something that
we know that we would love.
[SPEAKER_01]: All in all, I didn't get a chance to go to
any events for the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see anything with the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at the chaps event the whole time,
but I got to get up on stage again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this time it was to accept an award
for another great grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, this goes out to Hempman.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an overview of cannabis like I did in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be in regards to cannabis that's
medicinal, cannabis that's recreational,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis that's industrial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've changed the name so many
times that we've come to believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana is what you smoke for medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is what you use for industrial
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't even know what people
think cannabis is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all a great plant that helps us every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medicinal, there's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met many people in Toronto that told us
about how they got off most of their pain
[SPEAKER_00]: meds, or some of their pain meds,
or all of their pain meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say thanks to all you guys that
actually came down to see us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we didn't get a chance to say,
hey, as we were running the background,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, I guess we're going to
wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are taking off their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking off my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for checking us out in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you maybe tomorrow for Puff
Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you tomorrow for Puff
Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
