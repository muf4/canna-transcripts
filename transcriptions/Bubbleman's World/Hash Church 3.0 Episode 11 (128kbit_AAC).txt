[SPEAKER_08]: I have very few people who have replied
today and I'm gonna have to go on to
[SPEAKER_08]: YouTube, but then I'm gonna have to find
the actual link.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there it is right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about this guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit rusty today, but I'll send
the link over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not sure if anyone's even gonna
show up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this could just be me hanging out
puffing bowls and talking.
[SPEAKER_08]: With everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a while since I did a spur of
the moment hash church.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, our last hash church was in
honor of Horatio Delbert, our past church
[SPEAKER_08]: alumni who passed away recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we wanna send our regards to his family
and all the friends and all the people
[SPEAKER_08]: that he sort of supported over the years
and inspired and blew away with all of his
[SPEAKER_08]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we're back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was frozen for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, so let's say hi to the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got, oh, we got happy guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got Kelly, Kelo, N-O-G.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got squishy, Manitoba Goat,
Medically Fit, Bingo Lombardi's in the
[SPEAKER_08]: chat holding it down.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got Dirty42 and K2LED and Justin
Cash.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got about 120 people watching right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got people in the room that I'm
gonna let in right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got Hemp Guy, I got Colin, and I got
someone I don't even recognize,
[SPEAKER_08]: but let's see who it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on, boys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm literally in the world.
Oh!
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see if my headset will connect
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cutting out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not working.
[SPEAKER_08]: You there, Hemp Guy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Your microphone, I heard you there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything's rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we got this other one here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know who that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on, buddy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning, Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: You there, Hemp Guy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I gotta be honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, who the heck is that dig on
M-O-E-Q?
[SPEAKER_08]: How did you get that?
[SPEAKER_08]: How did you get your name to be such a
crazy name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Firewall.
Weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Mike?
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Howdy, howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm on the coast of Maine right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just chilling out?
[SPEAKER_04]: See why my headphones should be working.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife wanted to come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We live so close to Maine that we've never
had a chance to really explore it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an hour and a half from us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I committed to it, and then I got your
email.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, it's hard to back out of
the commitment when you've committed to
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, the last time I was in Maine was in
1994, and I drove all the way to Bangor to
[SPEAKER_08]: see Fish play at a high school gymnasium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember the Bangor Maine
Festival, and that was just an incredible
[SPEAKER_04]: run of music for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did the 37-minute long tweezer from a
live one at that show that I was at.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the first time, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not the first time, but it was one
of the longest ones they did, and I guess
[SPEAKER_08]: it was a special enough one that they felt
they were going to put it on their live
[SPEAKER_08]: double album titled Alive One.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, let me put you on view so we can see
that, Colin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, welcome, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: With the long hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mute myself, and I'm going to figure out
how to put my earpods there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, you rocking those pros?
[SPEAKER_04]: I am, and they're giving me so much
trouble these days, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not connecting to my phone right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's no bueno.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some cold cure lemon cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you went on mute there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just went and pressed some hash church
last night.
[SPEAKER_08]: How is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually really quite nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: The photos were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely didn't get the yield that I
was expecting, but I'm going to do some
[SPEAKER_08]: more, so it was just really a small press
on my Helix Pro here on the side of my
[SPEAKER_08]: desk, so it was the crank unit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the most amount of pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning, sir.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you know, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a message yesterday from Ian
Davidson, and I've been trying to get him
[SPEAKER_08]: onto Hash Church for a long time to come
and share all of his incredible knowledge
[SPEAKER_08]: on not only growing in greenhouses,
but also starting the tissue culture
[SPEAKER_08]: company and getting into the explanation
of initiation and multiplication and
[SPEAKER_08]: meristemic micropropagation, basically.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything I learned about tissue culture,
like 95% of it has come from Ian,
[SPEAKER_08]: and probably 5% of it came from Chimera,
because he was talking about it almost 20
[SPEAKER_08]: years ago, way before anyone was,
I guess, really able to make it
[SPEAKER_08]: economically viable as a business.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know skunk man Sam as well had done it
25 plus years ago, so it would have been
[SPEAKER_08]: good to have him on.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's impossible to get on in the weekends
because he's got a little girl that he
[SPEAKER_08]: spends his time with, his daughter,
but he said last night he was going to try
[SPEAKER_08]: and make it in, so I'm really hoping today
he's going to be able to come in and share
[SPEAKER_08]: with us some good stuff on tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: But otherwise, we can chill out and puff
some bowls.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do that regardless.
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew a group in central California who
did that a decade ago, but they had
[SPEAKER_06]: brought in a woman from South Africa who
had did it in South Africa for 27 years,
[SPEAKER_06]: and just after she did it, she's like,
okay, I'm going to retire now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They couldn't continue it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically had it started,
and they had to let it die because they
[SPEAKER_06]: couldn't perpetuate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: With tissue culture, do you guys have
anything to say about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people offering it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get emails all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple of people in the
Massachusetts state or the state of
[SPEAKER_04]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_04]: My earpiece fell out.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The main theme that I keep being told is
it will replace your mother room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, is that something that everyone feels
like the techniques and the, I guess,
[SPEAKER_04]: the SOPs that you would follow are that
solid that we would not have to keep live
[SPEAKER_04]: plants any longer, or would you say that
we would want to keep maybe both at the
[SPEAKER_04]: same time?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on that kind of
stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: As somebody who's worked with tissue
culture, I can say that when you reproduce
[SPEAKER_01]: meristems under tissue culture,
so in a glass container with agro,
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever your formula for nutrients,
one of the problems is every few years,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really need to take the plants out and
refresh them by growing them as a big
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and taking fresh new pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely takes up less room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're big enough, it may make economic
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian at Segrim is the man to talk to about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who's interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope he shows up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an interesting discussion because it
was perpetuated in a lab, so I always
[SPEAKER_06]: thought about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you maintain the genetic,
as well as keep it perpetually going?
[SPEAKER_06]: My thought would always keep some sort of
backup data always.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have that problem with a computer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I would think of to do
would be to maintain that same situation
[SPEAKER_06]: with genes because if electricity goes out
and then the chamber that that's stored in
[SPEAKER_06]: dies, now what?
[SPEAKER_06]: You crack, start from those, start
collecting genetics from other people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think one of the great ways is
maintaining it under very small pieces of
[SPEAKER_08]: it, just the tissue.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't even have to be the living
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can maintain that in liquid nitrogen
in a very small, inexpensive method.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that way, you can really get into
redundancies where you could have two or
[SPEAKER_08]: three different sites where you maintain
your library.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes up a very, very small amount of
room versus how much room it would take
[SPEAKER_08]: for you to keep those mothers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's gotten quite to the
point yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also when we compare it to
strawberries or raspberries, they don't
[SPEAKER_08]: seem to have the same variation when it
comes to commercial production.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got your one banana and your
Driscoll's does your one strawberry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this one cultivar that everyone's
just like, oh, I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just buy the Driscoll strawberries.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they grew 10 billion plantlets
this year all over the world in different
[SPEAKER_08]: parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: From those companies' perspectives,
obviously it's going to be a lot easier to
[SPEAKER_08]: keep a plant that's one single genetic.
[SPEAKER_08]: We come from the cannabis industry where
on average, I'm sure we're going to want
[SPEAKER_08]: to have at least 500 plus genetics kept
alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's 1,000, maybe it's 1,500.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but there's a lot of
different varieties of cannabis out there,
[SPEAKER_08]: little variations in phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Losing those from a cannabis connoisseur
perspective is frightening.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to maintain all those flavors and
all those different effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you think of the nostalgia that
occurs in an old-school puffer when
[SPEAKER_08]: they're like, oh yeah, we used to get this
one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've asked Sam how many times people have
asked him about the roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, whatever happened to the roadkill
skunk?
[SPEAKER_08]: We have nostalgia over these different
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roadkill skunk actually ran over on the
road and doesn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm feeling it on that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you heard it here first.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I was doing this work
originally 30 years ago was exactly to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it maintained.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had 600 clones at that time,
and keeping them all alive and maintained
[SPEAKER_01]: was a pain in the butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted a method where I could take
meristems or callus, freeze it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and keep it the way you're talking about
in liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have 1,000 in a small portable
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't even have to be liquid
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get freezer to minus 50 really
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'll do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: To Mark's point, it's frightening to lose
some of these varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: The security that I always had was to give
it to your closest buddies and make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that if anything were to happen,
you could at least call upon them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're so far from that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The paradigm has really shifted.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1,800 square feet of mums are not going to
be sharing 1,800 square feet of cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was going to say was I'm sure many
more varieties than exist now have been
[SPEAKER_01]: lost in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've got some good news.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like good news.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got word from Ebony Worsley,
who is Sean Worsley, who is the veteran
[SPEAKER_06]: arrested in Alabama.
[SPEAKER_06]: For traveling through with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our group, the Veterans Action Council,
actually sent a letter to Alabama full of
[SPEAKER_06]: a whole bunch of people who have served
saying, let him out, let him go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ebony let us know that Alabama is going to
be releasing him on parole.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some positive news there.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the same side, we got some bad news.
[SPEAKER_06]: A friend of mine at the Veterans Virtual
Happy Hour, Jose Balen and them,
[SPEAKER_06]: were vying for a reschedule.
[SPEAKER_06]: They applied to the Supreme Court of the
United States and got it all the way
[SPEAKER_06]: through to there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then this week, the Supreme Court decided
not to hear the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, the rescheduling that we
tried for, vied for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, again, it was on
hypotheticals where the court wants to see
[SPEAKER_06]: you actually be damaged or hurt by the
proceedings somewhere along the lines and
[SPEAKER_06]: they just threw it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to try again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got to try again and wait till
after the Democrats win and pack the
[SPEAKER_01]: Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then use it with facts instead of theory
and you'll do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're trying to use.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've assembled the veterans from across
the United States and we're going to use
[SPEAKER_06]: our power to go after Biden to work on a
Beau Biden medical marijuana bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because his son, as even he spoke of,
could even have used it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to not stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to embarrass them or use our
power and our voices to continue the
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two steps forward, one step back,
take it on the chin, regroup, reorganize,
[SPEAKER_06]: and fight again.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Mr. Worsley is going home.
[SPEAKER_06]: That leaves some good news.
[SPEAKER_06]: A drug war prisoner is going home.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, when the fuck does anyone ever get
let out of prison in Louisiana?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Alabama, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Alabama.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a challenging case.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hard finding a counsel.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of challenges there because
there's no medical defense and he had been
[SPEAKER_06]: busted in Alabama prior and was let go to
Arizona to do his parole and he got busted
[SPEAKER_06]: on parole there, which is why he went back
to Alabama.
[SPEAKER_06]: That he was even to get parole due to this
is pretty much a miracle in itself and one
[SPEAKER_06]: we're thankful for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, our pressure helped.
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to continue to use whatever
voices we have to help people who are
[SPEAKER_06]: still hurt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget, if you're free, send the
elevator back down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Help out people, brothers and sisters who
are still in jail for this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sharing is caring, which, for me,
reminds me to give a big shout out to one
[SPEAKER_08]: of my mentors, Ron Hickey, my good old
buddy Ron, who recently sent me two
[SPEAKER_08]: beautiful five-foot tall Congolese plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's full circle because five or
six or seven or eight years ago,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know when, whenever I started
really giving the Congo away, he was one
[SPEAKER_08]: of the first people I actually gave it to.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of a controlled cultivar for a
while.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people felt like they were going to
keep this cultivar and really control this
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivar and make seeds and sell it and
make the money.
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of put the kibosh on that by giving
it away to everyone, literally like Dr.
[SPEAKER_08]: Atomic and Remo and Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: I gave it to everyone, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I gave that thing out to everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's come back to me, John.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday, two five-foot tall Congo
plants, beautiful Congo plants that Ron
[SPEAKER_08]: was growing out on his deck arrived.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the Congo back and I'm pretty darn
proud.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty darn happy to have the Congo back.
[SPEAKER_08]: On that note, I would like to welcome Mr.
Regenerative Joshua to the room with the
[SPEAKER_08]: orange tuque.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: The tuque.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Canadian for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Colin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you on top of a rock somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm actually in Maine right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I drove up here with my better half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just exploring the coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry if I feel towering today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Josh?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just heard you guys talking about the
Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that cut a couple of years back when
we went up there to do the regen
[SPEAKER_00]: conference in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It trickled its way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been pollinating with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few rounds of pollination on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool plant, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Roberts Creek one, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one we're probably out talking
about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I call it Le Mano Negra cut because it was
my friend Alex who actually collected it
[SPEAKER_08]: from the Pygmies in the Congo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it went to Reefer Man, and Reefer
Man, I think, ended up taking it to the
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then people on the Sunshine Coast got
control of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you had your Green Supreme and your
Alvie Alchemist and befriended Le Mano
[SPEAKER_08]: Negra's wife, Reyna Genga, and started
trying to control this plant that just
[SPEAKER_08]: needed to be shared.
[SPEAKER_08]: It needed to be gifted.
[SPEAKER_08]: It needed to be given to people because it
is a really unique cultivar.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a nice ... I've heard it has THCV
in it is actually what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never actually seen the COA from the
Congo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't be surprised if some of that
South African found its way out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was tested by Tim through Kind
Selections.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the Congo here right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what it was on the bottom,
tested by him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, THCVA.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is right now, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you're saying it, I got gifted this the
other day when I was at Horatio's,
[SPEAKER_07]: actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who do you think gave that to Tim?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Along with the East Coast Sour Diesel?
[SPEAKER_08]: You bet, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good to give these things away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it smells so amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: On that note, I'm doing a dab of the
Congo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hit the Congo, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I've been smoking a joint of
this entire time, which I'm like,
[SPEAKER_06]: y'all like, Congo, Congo, Congo.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend Amber has a company called the
Congo Club, which Amber's senator.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amber's senator.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: She does the Congo Club.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's actually going to be doing a
concentrate infused where she's taking
[SPEAKER_06]: keef and actually infusing the Congolese
joint with the Congo keef.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're stacking Congo here, Cali.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the Congolese terpenes profile
like, guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had the terpenes, I believe,
from the Blue River terpenes, Marcus,
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Congo, but I've not smoked the
flower or hash from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the profile?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very exotic.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very perfumey.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just something different than what
you constantly get with the gases and the
[SPEAKER_08]: fruits and all these different sort of
musky flavors.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Congo is definitely a special one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a big bag of it right now,
actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty excited to start squishing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I squished the hash church last night and
made a little bit of rosin, but I think
[SPEAKER_08]: today, maybe even during church,
I might press out a little Congo with my
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit of nug that I got left.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much of that hash church did you press
and how much came out?
[SPEAKER_08]: I pressed a very small amount and I didn't
get a ton, but I pressed it on my Helix
[SPEAKER_08]: Pro and I didn't have it sort of tied to
my table with these.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need a really proper table because
when you crank the last little bit where
[SPEAKER_08]: you go from about 8,000 pounds up to
14,000 pounds, you really need it to be
[SPEAKER_08]: steady.
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't really get it much over 10,000
and it was low.
[SPEAKER_08]: I put in four grams and I got out 0.5,
so it was about 12%.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I did hit it a second time and I
actually didn't collect the rosin from the
[SPEAKER_08]: second press.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm guessing it's probably around 18%.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said he got around 20% to 22% when he
pressed rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me a little suspicious as to how
it can be so resinous.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it is these hooked trichomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get in on the bud later today
and photograph it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really reminds me of an old cultivar I
used to grow years back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking almost 30 years ago from
Holland that I got called Dutch Treat.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never seen another Dutch Treat that
looked like this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just coated and resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It had a really musky, almost hashed plant
smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, I've got a little nostalgia on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the way the plant looks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still going to wash it, see how much
the mouth comes out, what kind of yields I
[SPEAKER_08]: get.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty excited about it, actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to hop in back on the Congo
before we moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just on the phone with Vision
Creator last week talking about the Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember his partner's name,
but they're working with a university up
[SPEAKER_00]: there in BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done an S1 line of it that they
are just about to release.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have 1,500 seeds of S1s they're going
to release on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe give a follow-up to Vision Creator
if you guys are interested in getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: hold of those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's usually in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's been really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one that was getting it out to
all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It trickled out, too, in my circle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of those cuts, especially now,
where legality isn't really a problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: I generally just, if I have it,
I give it to whoever asks me for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't imagine being like, one of the
guys that likes to control this cultivar,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I won't call him out because it just
makes him sound like such a piece of shit,
[SPEAKER_08]: but he was like, I've got to make sure
that the person is worthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh, dude, that is everything
that's wrong in the world right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: The person is worthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: What if the person isn't worthy,
but his little girl is worthy and is
[SPEAKER_08]: having seeds and needs this cultivar to
stop those seizures?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do we create these reasons to be
greedy and to maintain control over
[SPEAKER_08]: something as awesome as a cannabis
cultivar?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, listen, I get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you spent 20 years or 10 years in your
greenhouse and you collected the seeds,
[SPEAKER_08]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is a cultivar that was collected
in Africa.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was meant to be given out as a gift.
[SPEAKER_08]: The pygmies meant it to be a gift.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just seems like a strange thing to
try and collect and control someone else's
[SPEAKER_08]: work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just give that shit away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a variety from the Congo one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was given from the pygmies to Jean Paul
Hallet, who was a famous explorer down
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had all these plans to grow massive
amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a logo all picked out,
get small.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem was the weed just didn't
cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your Congo is great by its side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask you, Ms. Sam, because you're
probably the guy that's gone through the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was here, Marcus said that I was
thinking, well, that's usually someone
[SPEAKER_00]: that has a lot of insecurities that's
holding onto something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I've started to run through larger
sifts, a 500,000, I've gotten really
[SPEAKER_00]: confident that I'm kind of sitting in this
position right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's an immature position to be
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like I don't need any one
specific elite cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can find enough stuff if I go through
big enough populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess the question is,
do you find that to be true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you still think that it's like,
yeah, those elites are elites and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: outliers?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you consider a big population?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could be whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 20,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 20,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at 20,000, you will probably get a
very elite cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a closet with 10 plants, you're lucky
to get an elite cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Ian.
[SPEAKER_06]: They tried to do the same thing with OG
Kush, where people tried to hold onto it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people swore, and it wasn't until the
person who made that original swear died
[SPEAKER_06]: that it finally made its propagation out
through the 90s and made its way out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've never understood the absolute
sentencing of a genetic to private use and
[SPEAKER_06]: nobody getting access to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also different ways to pass things
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you felt you worked for years and years
and selection and selection to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular cut, then make seeds and sell
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can make millions of seeds and
pass it out to the community and everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: that wants one can get one.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I like is that you actually speak
from experience when you said you can make
[SPEAKER_08]: millions of seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that motherfucker has done this
already.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done it many times.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about sweet skunk crossed with
Congolese?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, snapper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I wanted to welcome Ian Davidson to
the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Segura himself has arrived and I got
to welcome him to the room, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran a little late.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was chasing some horses around here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you know, I was in the forest.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in the forest yesterday in Squamish
picking mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were picking yellow foots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, chanterelles and a horse was
walking through the forest.
[SPEAKER_08]: At first, we thought it was a wild horse,
but it actually had had a person with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it reminded me of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know how much your daughter likes to
ride horses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we had some breakouts this morning
here, but it's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a little bit into the conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Etienne asked a good or maybe it
wasn't Etienne.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember who asked the question,
but it was basically like, are we in a
[SPEAKER_08]: place with tissue culture and cannabis
right now where people, oh, it was Colin,
[SPEAKER_08]: that we could get to a point.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, actually, before I ask this
question, what I would really like,
[SPEAKER_08]: Ian, is for you to introduce yourself,
let everyone know a little bit of your
[SPEAKER_08]: history in the industry and let them know
how you came to start and become a part of
[SPEAKER_08]: the tissue culture company Segura
International.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a good start, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a little spiel here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pushing the buttons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, probably like most
people here have been in this for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time in California primarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you guys have heard of my
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started this company, Biologic Systems,
and we've got a whole line of certified
[SPEAKER_03]: organic spill amendments and et cetera
down here in Cali, primarily in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've done that for a long time,
kind of seen the industry through that
[SPEAKER_03]: lens quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I ended up spending about
four years down in Santa Barbara County,
[SPEAKER_03]: scaling a fair bit of the several of the
big greenhouses down there, working with
[SPEAKER_03]: these Dutch guys and helping them to kind
of figure out, you know, what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, in that process,
we scaled up to producing about around
[SPEAKER_03]: 150,000 clones a month and just really got
out of control, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to manage a half acre of mother
plants and trying to do all that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, with the pesticides that we have
at hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and it's just a huge challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, about four years ago,
I started looking at tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, down in Cali, you know,
we watch these strawberry growers come out
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, they'll plant a million
strawberry plants over a weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All from TC.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all look exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's the way that they're
doing business ticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they got a little jet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're flying around with their tissue
culture plants, making it happen,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in all their locations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, the question was like,
why can't we do it for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do it for these other plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I started doing my
homework and I spent about a year
[SPEAKER_03]: traveling around the world and that pretty
much every company I could find that was
[SPEAKER_03]: claiming to do this work on cannabis and
learned all about it along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned the questions that you ask and,
you know, the key metrics, how the
[SPEAKER_03]: business works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and then I met the team at SEGRA in
Vancouver there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they really, to me, seem to be kind of
the clear leader in the in the space,
[SPEAKER_03]: really for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, our doctors abide that runs our
TC program.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been working on cannabis for 15 years
under a federal research license in
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, we also have a
genotyping lab that allows us to do,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we do over a thousand samples a
month right now, just checking everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, checking to make sure we don't mix
stuff up, you know, starting to look and
[SPEAKER_03]: observe at and managing soma clonal
variation, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a huge piece of the of the TC puzzle and
is really kind of the big risk that's
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can elaborate on that a bit,
I'm on a little bit of a tangent now,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's probably a real important one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you got all these TC labs
popping up all over for cannabis right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, what happens in
conventional tissue culture, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: is usually around like four years after
making clones from clones from clones and
[SPEAKER_03]: TC, you start to see mutation,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants start to mutate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you're literally,
you know, compounding that clonal process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's any kind of mutation that
happens, there's a good chance it can
[SPEAKER_03]: carry on because you're making these
clones so fast from each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, managing that risk,
like we're seeing in cannabis at about two
[SPEAKER_03]: years into the process that some clonal
variation starting to rear its head at
[SPEAKER_03]: like statistically relevant levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, there's a whole process
of how you manage that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can isolate shoots, you know,
we have a genotyping lab, so we can
[SPEAKER_03]: isolate a hundred shoots that have not
mutated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you start building a population from
those, you ramp that population up and you
[SPEAKER_03]: start ramping down the old population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what they do, you know,
blueberries, bananas, papayas,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's the way that business
works where, you know, they all know the
[SPEAKER_03]: mutation is a risk and you watch for it
and you monitor it and you react to it and
[SPEAKER_03]: you can actually manage it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you know, if you're running a TC lab
and you're not watching those things and
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't have the capacity to do that
kind of testing, it can be a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: disaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're starting to see that in Cali
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen several of these labs out here
where they're at about that process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're two years in,
two and a half years in, and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to see really weird things
happening and they don't really know any
[SPEAKER_03]: idea why or like the tools to be able to
study it and figure out what's going on
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you see the same thing like that in
the same moms over years of taking cuts
[SPEAKER_07]: and trying to hold that mom, say,
over 10 or 20 years?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you see the same in what you're
talking about right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm just raising a question to
myself as you're talking about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had the same genetic drift 15 years,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: 18 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So genetic drift is when you're going to
have that mutation happen in live plants
[SPEAKER_03]: right outside of TC.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you know, our assumption at this
point from everything that we see all this
[SPEAKER_03]: research we're doing right now is that 99
percent of those symptoms that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing are not mutation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are either viruses or they're
intercellular bacteria, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And more than likely, the second of those
categories, the intercellular bacteria,
[SPEAKER_03]: where what that is is when you're making
clones, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you say you're the mother plant and I
come in with my razor blades and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: slicing you up all over the place,
you're probably going to get some
[SPEAKER_03]: infections, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, bacteria are going to start
working their way into your body.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when we do the tissue culture
process with these serial clones,
[SPEAKER_03]: like these really, really old clones,
a couple of the worst have come from yours
[SPEAKER_03]: truly on this call or Marcus truly on this
call.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, these old clones, they've been
they've been cut so many times and each
[SPEAKER_03]: time you're building up this bacterial
load.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these aren't plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are essentially functioning like a
parasite in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like yeast infection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they slow the plant down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make the plant's immune system drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and when you do the tissue
culture, the initiation process,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we've got a technique we do that
literally migrates all that stuff out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like snot coming out of the side
of the stem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's some tricks you do
to just kind of keep sucking it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, so mutation from cloning is
very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does it does happen, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it happens very slowly over a course
of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what we can see from all the
genotype testing we're doing in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: we haven't seen an example yet with a
clone where we've seen a documented
[SPEAKER_03]: mutation between two clones and any
connection to a symptom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, what we all really need to
be focused on there is the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the pathogen side of the equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what's causing the problem
in the cloning, you know, serial cloning
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask a definition question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissue culture versus like Mary stem
scrubbing, you know, I think that a lot a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people I've heard and so I'm asking
you can clarify for me and for everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've heard a lot of people misuse the
word tissue culture when they're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to a true tissue culture or they're doing
some sort of scrub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain that to me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of I'm kind of guilty right here
misusing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so tissue tissue culture is is a
family of technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, the majority of people
in the world who are studying the field of
[SPEAKER_03]: plant tissue culture, they're actually in
the genetic engineering world.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so like there's there's really two
forms that you can execute tissue culture
[SPEAKER_03]: from.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is callus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a little blob of
undifferentiated cells like you'll see in
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little blob in like a Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those cells are essentially like stem
cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where you can go and like
insert your pig genes or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever kind of crazy GMO you're trying
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That all happens through callus tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which has nothing to do with mass
production, nodal propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you start with meristematic tissue
culture, you isolate the meristem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start growing from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then literally you're making clones
from clones from clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd refer to that as nodal propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so 90 percent of the field of tissue
culture are these probably more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninety five are these guys that are
studying callus tissue culture really with
[SPEAKER_03]: the goal of developing genetically
engineered plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people doing nodal propagation for
production is this really small subset of
[SPEAKER_03]: the business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, this guy, doctors abide
that works for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only about a hundred of those guys
in the world that know how to manage these
[SPEAKER_03]: labs that produce over 10 million plants a
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a it's a, you know, that world is
as much farming as it is a science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these guys that know how to run these
big production labs, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they can look at a crop of jars like you
could probably look at a room full of edge
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and be like, oh, they need a little
more of this or a little less of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's you know, it's art and
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, the you know, there's a whole
suite of technologies like synthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it goes on that all of
these technologies fit within the field of
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we're really focused on is just
that micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't trying to call you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's an important starting point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you could really be talking
micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, you know, like you're saying,
this is going on with strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hearing you say how actually small
the percentage of people you said that
[SPEAKER_00]: under 100 people are actually doing that
micro prop proficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are is it I mean, is it a bigger
big lab?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because there's about a hundred of
them in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the ones that are doing it can
throw out so much that they're making a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like VITRO plus, VITRO plus in Poland,
they produce 80 percent of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: ornamental ferns for the entire planet
from a single lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ian, quick question.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a bunch of people who are
watching.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's only 100 of these people in
the world, what would they if somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: were watching and wanted to learn how to
do this propagation and learn the science,
[SPEAKER_06]: what would you recommend that they take in
college?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd recommend that they go to Chiba
University in Japan and study with Dr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kozai, who is the father of tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have the most advanced tissue
culture program in the world there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where doctors abide studied.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, it's you know,
it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like like to get into the field,
you got to get in these labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like I see a lot of people
passing around this like plant and test
[SPEAKER_03]: tubes book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're not going to learn how to do
mass production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through that book, you know, like the the
real what really kind of qualifies these
[SPEAKER_03]: professionals is experience at scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the ability to like I kind
of started out talking about that soma
[SPEAKER_03]: clonal thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like managing all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's farming, you know, like you you get
good at it over years and decades of
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's kind of the most
profound part to me of this whole business
[SPEAKER_03]: is like it's this crazy intersection of
like manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And plants, you know, where we really are
getting about as close as you can get to
[SPEAKER_03]: like a manufacturing process, still
working with with a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the schools in Japan you're talking
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they teach in Japanese or English?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have to learn Japanese first?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: They teach the science is taught in
English.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, doctors abide when there is an
English teacher or English student.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this micro prop concept,
in my mind, I hear I've heard tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, you can hand
over your genetics to a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can chop it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it in the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's an refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can pull it out of that
refrigerator whenever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the same with the micro proper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more like micro up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's two different kind of
approaches on the storage side.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we're doing it right now, like at
Cegara, we've got germplasm collections
[SPEAKER_03]: now for 10 of the big LPs in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're like backing up their stuff and,
you know, in some cases, doing micro
[SPEAKER_03]: propagation.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all of that storage in our method.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're storing all the plants still as as
nodes, as live nodes in the jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we do is we put them in a special
media that makes them grow really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so they typically in TC,
we have to move all of our plantlets into
[SPEAKER_03]: a fresh jar with fresh media every four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't, they die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're you know, all the
nutrients they're taking up are in the
[SPEAKER_03]: agar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their their whole carbon source is in the
agar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The light isn't even the light is
basically just tricking them to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: stay alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're growing off of the sugar from
the agar rather than photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we can store plants by
slowing them down where that now we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have to transfer them every month.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can transfer them every three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it and in that kind of storage,
you can call it up really fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, let's say you decide, oh,
I want that plant, you know, then the
[SPEAKER_03]: other option is cryopreservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in cryopreservation, we can actually
put that stuff away in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you say you want and there,
you know, without touching it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it can last essentially indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you say you want to call something
up from cryopreservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for us right now, you know,
that's still an experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we think that timeline is
probably somewhere between six and 12
[SPEAKER_03]: months to be able to bring something out
and actually start working with it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Ian, before we get to taking something
out or even putting something in for
[SPEAKER_08]: storage, can you explain now as you
explain the you know how 80 to 90 percent
[SPEAKER_08]: of problems with plants are actually these
viruses or fungi or intracellular
[SPEAKER_08]: bacterias?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you explain the importance of tissue
culture in the sense of initiation?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so, you know, TC tissue culture and
micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: More specifically here, it's a four step
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got, you know, initiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same four steps, whether you're
doing blueberries or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, initiation is the process where
you're going to remove all the
[SPEAKER_03]: contamination and then you move into
multiplication, where you're going to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, grow them, multiply them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Third stage is rooting, where you put the
roots on the plantlets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the fourth stage is acclimation,
where you 're going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just like with clones, right, slowly
reduce the humidity and bring them onto
[SPEAKER_03]: the real world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the initiation process is is
really quite fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's where a lot of people
are really struggling, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they think that they've made it through
the process and they think that they've
[SPEAKER_03]: got a clean culture and they start trying
to move into the next phase and the
[SPEAKER_03]: multiplication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they really don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still some intracellular bacteria
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still things or virus that are
that are slowing that process down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, initiation for us,
we've done now over 150 cultivars and
[SPEAKER_03]: we've been successful at all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't been able to get through the
process yet, but they range.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some of them are going as fast
as five months through that process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are taking 12 or 14 months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really depends on how dirty that
stuff is when it comes into us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, these serial clones that
have come in, yeah, some of them have
[SPEAKER_03]: taken a year to get through that process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other times when we're working right from
a seed, you know, that can go super fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the seed isn't chock full of all
this contamination yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can move a lot faster with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you'll hear a lot of people
talking about, you know, doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: process in two, three, four months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just really not realistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you really like when we make a
promise to a client, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we say it's going to take nine to 12
months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've done about 80% of the cultivars
in like six or seven months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really it's just these outliers that,
you know, do take that extra time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, basically what we're doing,
right, is we're isolating the meristem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so, you know, in the plant,
you know, the meristem is essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: separated from the vascular system of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's floating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's kind of a gel layer that
separates it from the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how these plants have evolved
to protect themselves from viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that growing tip is essentially growing
faster than the viruses can move in and
[SPEAKER_03]: infect it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you isolate that little tiny meristem,
you know, it's microscopic, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're going to grow that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to go through that
process again, and potentially again,
[SPEAKER_03]: if we have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so that's where,
you know, if it's clean enough,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can kind of catch it on that first
turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: But usually it's going to take more than
one cycle to get through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing you're going to need,
of course, Ian, and I'm sure you guys got
[SPEAKER_01]: it already, is test to confirm the fungi
was there and gone now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Test to confirm bacteria is there and then
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And test to confirm viruses were there and
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And few people know how to do that
properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we've got a lab,
our molecular biology lab in Richmond,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we've developed molecular based
assays now for what is like Cotapthera,
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhizoctonia, Sclerotinia, Botrytis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple more on there that we
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the, you know, the virus testing
right now is really a disaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in our opinion, we haven't seen a lab
yet that we consider to be validated doing
[SPEAKER_03]: a virus test on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like A&L in Canada, they're ripping tons
of these tests, they're issuing what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: assessing and assuming are false positives
left and right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, virus testing, like we're
learning with coronavirus, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the hardest analytical testing in the
world, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like viruses are constantly changing and
mutating and are extremely difficult to
[SPEAKER_03]: fingerprint and identify.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, let me get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be on that, Ian.
[SPEAKER_01]: The truth of it is most of these companies
don't know how many viruses have been
[SPEAKER_01]: identified in cannabis, whether they have
symptoms or not, it's a separate issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But identified 27.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, are you seeing things with the elder
clones like Bucerium and things that have
[SPEAKER_04]: been passed on from just backyard to tent
grower to indoor grower and back again?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were not testing for fungus and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking at viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think the key here is like,
if you look at how these other industries
[SPEAKER_03]: manage this risk, like strawberries,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in the strawberry business,
like they know that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the use of meristematic tissue culture
removes 99.999% of any of these risks,
[SPEAKER_03]: viruses, bacteria, etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, yeah, they're like studying
the viruses, of course, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's millions of dollars that goes into
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you know, really from the
production side, you know, they're like
[SPEAKER_03]: the bristles and stuff, you know,
they're not wasting their time,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they know that the technique
removes all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, on a very rare occasion,
something slips through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you know, of course,
they're trying to understand these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the key backbone of all
this is that when you look across all of
[SPEAKER_03]: these other crops that have gone through
this process, you know, that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: statistical reality is if you do the
process correctly, you're going to remove
[SPEAKER_03]: everything, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it might be another 20 years
before we really understand all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: viruses that are in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And absolutely, they're there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the majority of them may
well be completely benign.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're in really, really early days to
be able to understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would use huge caution in trusting
the data coming from any lab on these
[SPEAKER_03]: virus assays, like, you know, our,
you know, our chief science officer is a
[SPEAKER_03]: PhD virologist, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: He taught epidemiology at UBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, his take on this is
basically like, you know, for us,
[SPEAKER_03]: even at SEGRA, it's going to take us
probably another two years to have our
[SPEAKER_03]: first virus assays out, you know,
really trying to do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're talking like, you know,
millions of dollars of research money
[SPEAKER_03]: that's being designated to get to that
goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's a very tricky issue
right now, because we really don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: the analytical tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, several of these labs
appear to really be kind of running wild
[SPEAKER_03]: with this testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like in California now,
the whole hoplite and viroid deal here,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there's several labs offering
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we've been doing our due
diligence, like interviewing these labs,
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to see if we can find a partner
anywhere in the world to do this testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we haven't found anybody yet that we
feel like has really, has a validated
[SPEAKER_03]: process for looking at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I think the key for all of us in
the near term is like, we do know like,
[SPEAKER_03]: from looking at these other crops,
we have a technology that statistically
[SPEAKER_03]: should remove all of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, we don't have, you know,
the ability to do all of that testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, when things leave our
door, we go through our list of six,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we've got these six pathogens we
can test for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then obviously, you know, we're doing
microscopy and, you know, everything that
[SPEAKER_03]: we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's really early days,
still in having credible, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: virus detection at scale for for this
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be the early days, but at the same
time, it is the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at wine growers, so when they
plant a new field of grape varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: you better believe they're all certified
virus free, because they use any anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and who's, you know, who's
developing most of those cultivars,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's university systems, you know,
and and they've got, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, like UC Davis, you know,
they got hundreds of millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes into, you know, developing these
lines and developing the processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so, you know, I think as as
you start seeing, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the big, you know, ag institutional
universities in the country in the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: start to descend on this, you know,
we're going to get answers a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, right now, relying on,
you know, like small companies like Sagra
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, private small labs to like
figure this out, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: none of us have the budgets to be able to
really to really do it, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you say there's did you say there's
only 27 viruses that have been isolated at
[SPEAKER_06]: this time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so I.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you say, David?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I don't have a I don't have a
number on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you threw a number out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found 27 viruses that have been
identified in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than half of them do not have any
symptoms, but there's some controversy
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not if you have 10 of those non
symptom viruses, then collectively they
[SPEAKER_01]: may start to show symptoms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And are these listed and they have viruses
and diseases book or are these
[SPEAKER_06]: unclassified at this time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe maybe half of them are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones I've collected and been in
contact with viral researchers and Adam
[SPEAKER_01]: one by one by one by one until now the
total is 27.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a question and I've seen a good
bit at scale in terms of viral decline in
[SPEAKER_04]: a plant's health and specifically when it
when it goes from veg into flower,
[SPEAKER_04]: you see the you see the transformation
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've documented with with photos and I've
done this over the past few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my question is, is from a couple of
these things I've kept just to just in
[SPEAKER_04]: hopes that I could bring them into a
tissue culture environment and kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: clean them and bring them back to quote
unquote life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess the real question is,
is that hope and that dream to bring that
[SPEAKER_04]: specific variety back, is that real in
terms of what you were talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: When you bring it in to clean it,
are you going to come out with genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: drift?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how real is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what does that look like for someone
like myself that wants to save things and
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of preserve and keep things?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that everything is has been like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just there's two or three varieties
that I've noticed that just don't perform
[SPEAKER_04]: the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can clearly see it through photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you just got to get them into the
into the tissue culture process,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like we can't, you know,
we can't answer those questions yet of
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly what's, you know, what's there,
what's not right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but it's really kind of unimportant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like remove the stuff and,
you know, let's see what happens with the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of these plants like,
you know, we did over the last year and a
[SPEAKER_03]: half, we've done trials with four of the
big LPs where we built a TC lab in their
[SPEAKER_03]: facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: We grew their strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: We plowed the clones next to the TC plants
like 18 months later.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in some of those examples,
some of those examples, the plants came
[SPEAKER_03]: out and they don't even look like the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there was one that was like was like,
you know, narrow leaf indica, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plants that we initiated looked
like a long leaf sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after we removed whatever we did,
I don't know what we removed, plants
[SPEAKER_03]: looked totally different.
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked and the grower was like,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he showed me a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, dude, look at this plant from,
you know, six years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's the effect of all of
this on the plane, you know, is far and
[SPEAKER_03]: beyond, you know, potentially just like
slowing it down or, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: having little differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it can be it can be drastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's an extreme example I'm giving
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, most of the plants, you know,
what I see are extreme examples.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I could I should send you some
photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're extreme.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see that even the internode,
you know, nodal banks are just it's
[SPEAKER_04]: insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're you're looking at very
different, completely different plants on
[SPEAKER_04]: us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's that's really good
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: So are we at the point where you think we
can replace mother rooms and and put them
[SPEAKER_04]: into you know, with with the trained
operator to really run your varieties over
[SPEAKER_04]: and over, like you're saying with micro
propagation or are we still in that
[SPEAKER_04]: in-between stage where we're still
learning what the best path forward is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think, you know, I think we're
we're still kind of in the middle of that
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like at at Sager, I mean,
we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're we're now producing plants
at scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shipped out orders this year up to
forty thousand in a single order.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: The you know, the real challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a couple of things, you know,
is cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they don't all perform the same
in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some that, you know, really seem
to slip right in there and be very happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's others that aren't right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't multiply as easily,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, like I said,
you know, we've got about two hundred and
[SPEAKER_03]: fifty cultivars that we've put through the
process, you know, and out of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's about 30 now, you know,
that we feel really confident,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in our ability to consistently
produce them and and the acclimation,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to know how to bring them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you'll see you'll see a lot of
these plants that come out looking like
[SPEAKER_03]: Chia pets or, you know, kind of crazy,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's that's, again,
the whole talent of like, how do you make
[SPEAKER_03]: that transition really smooth,
you know, as you're coming out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: process and and, you know, that's
something that takes years of of trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and so, you know, there's really kind
of like at this point in the in the
[SPEAKER_03]: evolution of tissue culture for cannabis,
at least for us, you know, it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of a phenotyping process that we go
through again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the plant where it's like you give me
your thing that's got everything you like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I put it in TC and,
you know, it's going to take us some time
[SPEAKER_03]: to figure out how to work with it in that
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and we've got some cultivars
that we're just like, that one's going on
[SPEAKER_03]: the shelf like we're, you know,
we could maybe spend a bunch of time and
[SPEAKER_03]: energy working with it and figuring it
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's, you know, at this point in the
game, we can't, you know, we're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: just focus on going with what we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the, you know, I think the integration
into like production, the thing that's
[SPEAKER_03]: been really interesting is that,
you know, these TC plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's this term called like a signoidal
curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when you look at the growth of a
cannabis plant, you know, it kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: exponentially starts growing faster and
producing more biomass as it, as it gains
[SPEAKER_03]: momentum and gain size.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, what we've noticed with the
TC plants is, you know, for the first two
[SPEAKER_03]: to three weeks of their life, they grow,
they do grow way slower than a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, essentially if you're going
to do this, you really are adding about
[SPEAKER_03]: two weeks of time, two to three weeks of
time into the overall growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that sounds like a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, wait a minute, I got to grow
that plant for another three weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's time and money and resources,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, however, you know, what we're,
what we're tending to do now is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, our product is, if you look on
our website, you know, we call them a
[SPEAKER_03]: microplug where they're tiny, you know,
they're, they're, instead of a 50 cell
[SPEAKER_03]: tray of clones, you know, there's 200 in
that same space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, most of our clients are
taking those and then they're putting them
[SPEAKER_03]: into a 50 cell tray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And putting them on a rack for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, yeah, it's taking an extra two
weeks, but it's at, on a vertical rack
[SPEAKER_03]: using almost no square footage and very
little lighting, you know, so,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, little energy in the trade off
is you get a plant that's consistent and
[SPEAKER_03]: clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it does have that extra
workflow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's a lot of complaints
around, oh, that, you know, the TC plants
[SPEAKER_03]: grow, you know, too slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, they do take a little longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, let's say you're doing,
you know, an ultra high density indoor
[SPEAKER_03]: where you only veg for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, you know, that's a challenge
because, you know, it's, it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: take longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, our little plants grow so slowly
in that, in that first phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's, you know,
one of the challenges, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the two real big challenges that we're
trying to manage are, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: getting that consistent growth coming out
of acclimation and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping our eyes on this whole mutation
risk, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian, there was a question in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about viruses and they said,
are the viruses airborne?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as I know, they're spread by
tools, by people and by insects with
[SPEAKER_01]: direct contact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only place I think there could be an
airborne risk is, is in, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: post-harvest processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're grinding up, you know,
lots of fresh material, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're literally grinding material and
putting it in the air, yeah, you can have,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but it's particles flying around
in the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like, you know, necessarily just,
you know, like, like us with COVID of like
[SPEAKER_03]: breathing bacteria, you know, it's not
going to just breathe off the,
[SPEAKER_03]: off the stomas of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, tools, you know, and I mean,
like you see, you know, down here in
[SPEAKER_03]: California, like guys that I know down
here that are getting more sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got systems now where like every
employee is sanitizing all of their tools
[SPEAKER_03]: between plants, you know, and that's
sanitization is an enormous deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like cloning, you know, like if you
are doing cloning, like you should be
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it in like a laboratory type
environment, you know, like you should be
[SPEAKER_03]: doing everything you can, you know,
like, I mean, I'm guilty over the years,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's like, you just start
getting used to it and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: use an old cutting board and some razor
blade or whatever, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: the use of, you know, peroxide and,
and what's the stuff and cleanse?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it calcium?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they call it stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hyperchlorate.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this other substance in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hypochlorous acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hypochlorous acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you should be using these tools,
you know, to, to make the absolute
[SPEAKER_03]: cleanest plant that you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, just going into the grow
room with your dirty hands and your dirty
[SPEAKER_03]: scissors and, and your tray and chopping
away, like, you know, you're asking for
[SPEAKER_03]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, definitely cleaning up that
workflow can make, you know, enormous,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, differences in your ability to
manage, manage the problem, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the, you know, the real solution will
be a concert of these things, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like moving to a real clean stock
kind of starting material like TC,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and then also, you know,
amping up the hygiene, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, like when you go in the big tomato
greenhouses, you know, those guys have,
[SPEAKER_03]: in a couple of them, I've seen these
things, like, I haven't seen the product
[SPEAKER_03]: yet and can't, in, in productized,
they make them themselves where like,
[SPEAKER_03]: when they squeeze their, their scissors on
the plants, it like shoots out a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of the sanitizing liquid right onto
the blade of the scissors, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they've got a little like pouch of
their, of their, you know, little
[SPEAKER_03]: sanitizer stuff that they're actually like
using out in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that in a couple of these big
million square foot greenhouses and like
[SPEAKER_03]: they both made them themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious if anybody has ever seen a
product like that, like I've searched
[SPEAKER_03]: around for one and I haven't been able to
find one, but, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The closest I've seen in is where people
use a tool for one plant, whether it's one
[SPEAKER_01]: chop or a hundred chops on that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they put the tool in a jar of a
disinfectant of some sort and use a
[SPEAKER_01]: different tool and leave them soaking in
there a half an hour or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they can reuse them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it sounds like fun, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you're in a greenhouse with a
hundred thousand plants trying to use
[SPEAKER_03]: clean tools on every plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, but it's, it, it will
definitely make it, you know, all the
[SPEAKER_03]: sanitation, sanitization efforts like
really do, really do pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also depends how big your plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother plant used to be 15 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could easily get thousands of clones
from one mother, then change a tool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So most of these viruses and bacteria come
through the cut part of a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not being transferred between each
plant as they touch each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically get stored in the plant
because of how it's propagated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're, you know, the cut is,
you know, just creating an open wound
[SPEAKER_03]: site.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, you think about in a
greenhouse or a grow like the amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: bacteria flying around in the air in
there, you know, of thousands and
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's really that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that cutting process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, like, again, when you're
making your moms, you know, using
[SPEAKER_03]: sanitized tools, you know, if you're
making really big cuts on a plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, using something, you know,
any of these tree, tree wound type
[SPEAKER_03]: substances, you know, to, to cover up that
big wound, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you wouldn't walk around with a huge cut
on your arm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're going to put something over it
to keep things clean, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, you know, I like anecdotally,
you know, these, these risks really from
[SPEAKER_03]: what I've seen so far seem to be much
higher with people who are running soil
[SPEAKER_03]: based systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, you know, I mean,
I'm a big organics guy myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: but gosh, you know, and you got soil in
that room and, you know, all the biology
[SPEAKER_03]: that comes in with that, you know,
is, is just another, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: another, another variable, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, however, you know, a lot of
those organisms may be really good at
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping your plant clean too, you know,
all the good guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it's a game of roulette,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So beneficial versus non-beneficial,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who wins?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the real key with it is that we
want to support ecosystems that promote
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial organisms, you know,
the, the new, the micro bacteria that
[SPEAKER_02]: within the soil that are going to feed the
plants, but at the same time, creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: sterile, you know, propagation line that,
that way that, you know, each time we
[SPEAKER_02]: propagate that clone, it comes out more
sterile than the previous time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, it's just a matter of
as, as you see those bad, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether bad insects or bad microbes show
up, there's a, there's generally a bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: insect or microbe that'll eat them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to, you know, there's for
example, lactobacillus eating mildew,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the mildews, but the, you know,
with the rules and regulations around
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, you have to, you know,
start from as clean of a cutting as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible, just to minimize that
contamination when you're restarting rooms
[SPEAKER_02]: or greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian, I want to say one thing and that was
that many viruses can be transmitted by
[SPEAKER_01]: both seeds and pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know about bacteria,
and fungi, but viruses, I would say the
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of them can be transported in
seeds and in pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a, that's a key comment right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like, if you look at,
crops like payas, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, they are produced
through tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also, you know, they're a prolific
seed producing plant, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, and why they're still done
through TC is because of the virus issues
[SPEAKER_03]: where, you know, they carry right through
the seed and, you know, you wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: to, hey, like a global viable,
you know, papaya industry without the
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to control and manage the virus,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on just one sec, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say on the,
the reason I was so quick to pop on on the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypochlorous acid is because I bought this
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a year ago that makes hypochlorous
acid water for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a weird deal and it's
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brand that I bought, it's not really
for farm use, but I think there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some models out there that are for
farm use and they basically electrolyze
[SPEAKER_00]: and use salt water to make a sterile,
low pH 2.5, electrolyze water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got it as it was sold as an IPM
deal, like I could spray the low pH to
[SPEAKER_00]: kill insects and then spray the extremely
high pH to kill pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's been all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working for me, you know,
to be honest, I haven't used it as much
[SPEAKER_00]: for that, but what I have used it for,
and it's really at my game and in taking
[SPEAKER_00]: my cuts and all my tools, because I just
pushed this button and out comes this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sterile, but it's not bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't not toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't mind being, being on me or
spilling or whatever, using excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I had this machine, I just pushed
the button and out it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I use it all over the place and
it's really stepped my game up in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my sterility, you know, cause I am an
organic guy and there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of stuff floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other comment on that is just
like being, being smart, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, things compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is a bigger guy to eat
something, but you know, there's a time
[SPEAKER_00]: and a place for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I, I leave the composting for the
compost pile and try to keep, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: things pretty, as clean as I can,
given the fact that I have a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, tons of plants growing in there
that are not just cannabis, there's all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about another thing I wanted to talk
about in regards to, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: what you guys are doing with tissue
culture is, is the lab work and the
[SPEAKER_08]: potential future of being able to use,
I guess, genetic identification,
[SPEAKER_08]: like being able to see the gene synthases,
find them in a way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we're not quite there yet,
but can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have any ideas?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm actually talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, anything about the breeding side?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it's, yeah, like, you know,
Segura, like I mentioned, we've got two
[SPEAKER_03]: different businesses, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the tissue culture operation led
by this guy, Dr. Zabide, and then we have
[SPEAKER_03]: a separate facility that's really run like
a different business.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our molecular biology lab run by
this guy, Dr. John Brunstein.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they're very intentionally
in two different places.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like at the genotyping lab,
we've got permits there to possess and do
[SPEAKER_03]: testing with all these controlled
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, obviously we want that to be in
a different place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, in that division of the
company, you know, we are working on
[SPEAKER_03]: developing a bunch of different genomics
tools that should lead us towards the
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to start doing marker assisted
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for us, there's a couple of
things I'd mentioned here where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the first genotyping test we
developed is called this VNTR test.
[SPEAKER_03]: And VNTR is what's used in essentially
every forensics lab in the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And VNTR has been established to be able
to tell, like, is the blood on the table
[SPEAKER_03]: your blood?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if so, you're going to
prison for life, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and it's, you know, used in all of
these forensics labs around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they have, you know, a standardized
test to be able to do this fingerprinting
[SPEAKER_03]: and everybody uses the same thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be nice in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, so we've developed that test
where, like, you give me a plant sample,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You give me two leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can test the two of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you, like, a fingerprint if
they're the same or not, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the same fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't tell any of the trait
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell if that plant's going to be
tall or short or high THC or low THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, that VNTR looks at 12
markers, which is, like, we found
[SPEAKER_03]: statistically to be just enough for us to
be able to, you know, with an extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: high level of certainty, guarantee two
things are the same or not, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, the key there is, you know,
as we're collaborating with other
[SPEAKER_03]: organizations, right, you can give us your
germplasm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's the only kind of
genotype test we would do on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in our contract.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says we'll do a VNTR.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just so we can guarantee that
we're not mixing things up and that when
[SPEAKER_03]: we ship it out, we VNTR it, make sure it's
exactly what it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, you know, behind the scenes,
we're developing other genomics tests that
[SPEAKER_03]: are really going to be useful for plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the whole kind of genomics
world of late has really been chasing this
[SPEAKER_03]: Illumina testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you'll hear, you know, phylospores
bioscience does, you know, and that's like
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely high resolution testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, really expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been developing tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like like that's like a
digital recording, you know, versus,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the I lost my train of thought
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the you know, the really high
resolution testing like Illumina is like
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at a digital recording,
whereas like the VNTR is kind of like a
[SPEAKER_03]: cassette tape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much lower resolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but it's way cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can run these VNTR tests for super
cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we're working on developing
tests that are kind of between Illumina
[SPEAKER_03]: and VNTR that are like stepping stones to
getting you to those to using the the
[SPEAKER_03]: higher resolution tests like the Illumina
test.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the whole like world here of
being able to identify high value markers
[SPEAKER_03]: and utilize those markers actively in a
breeding program, you know, is still very
[SPEAKER_03]: much in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we figure we're probably about
another, you know, two to three years out
[SPEAKER_03]: from being able to apply these
technologies to actually utilizing marker
[SPEAKER_03]: assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm sure some of these big
LPs are are making some moves there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to take quite a while to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you say, it's not it's not so simple,
Ian, because some markers, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a particular cannabinoid or for a
particular turkey that that you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you can't see is how much is a
plant going to express under optimal
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, is it going to produce a
whole lot of CDC or practically none that
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody's really got their hands around
that yet?
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's another question.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they do see that synthase, can they
tell if it will be on or off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not with certainty yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's it's, you know, I think all of
this is, you know, we're in we're in the
[SPEAKER_03]: dugout here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not even in the first inning,
you know, with the application of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, molecular breeding tools for for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's, you know, like a big
part of this is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: really like the university systems,
like once they start getting in and sink
[SPEAKER_03]: in there by budgets into this stuff,
it's going to start really, really rolling
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot faster, you know, because like on
the private sector, you know, the
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that really have the tech,
you know, they're not in cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're not they're not here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's, you know,
small companies like ours that are,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, chipping away at the bigger
picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think the, you know,
the big boys will be coming in here at
[SPEAKER_03]: some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they know for many other commercial
crops, much better than cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they have scratched the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they can find synthases and
terpenes and other markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ones that they really need for
vigor, for resistance, those are the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going to really change the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to do a jump off here,
fellas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm here at 1030.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, thanks for throwing it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a good start.
[SPEAKER_03]: We I mentioned you, Marcus, we're doing
this webinar on Thursday with Dr. Zabait
[SPEAKER_03]: is doing the ABCs of PTC on Thursday
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if any of you guys want to learn more,
that's going to be an awesome opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to go through a deck that goes
through, you know, all the different
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and then we're going to have a Q&A and
we're going to try and start doing those
[SPEAKER_03]: like once a month or something like that,
different related webinars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're getting on the webinar train.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if any of you guys want to join us,
it's free.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can register on our on our pages.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put your website up in the comments
in the description of this video so people
[SPEAKER_08]: will see it and be able to click on it and
go right to registering.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to come check it out as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: For making it on to Haschurch,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was an awesome throw down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And heads up, we're going to be in we're
going to be in the starting to operate in
[SPEAKER_03]: California this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working on that right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're getting we're we're making the
move.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you in California?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_06]: So come see us when if you're in northern
California.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to give you a tour of Berkeley
patients group.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in Auburn up by Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm in the hood for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So great to connect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should definitely go see it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: You will be very happy that you did.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can promise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great Sunday and love all your
families and be safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk to you later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I felt like that was some pretty
good information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice little conversation for about an hour
there on tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully I'll be able to get Ian back
here one day because he is a wealth of
[SPEAKER_08]: information when it comes to this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love asking questions when I can
understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you, it is the future of
cannabis breeding and mass production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the way they do strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the way they do grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if we're going to have our Costco
ounces.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to be that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if it's going to be propagated
nationally in a way that is consistent so
[SPEAKER_06]: I can get my same Oji Kush here is the
same Oji Kush on the East Coast without
[SPEAKER_06]: any issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Congolese or whatever genetic.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's still the issue and still the
problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: So every growers manufacture producers
dealing with this problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of how to propagate safely their genetics
and it's one I had problems with when I
[SPEAKER_06]: was working with Ed because we definitely
at Rosenthal went because we were
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely not in a sterilized room and
environment and we had, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: certain problems that just inadvertently
happen and to know that this type of
[SPEAKER_06]: research is out there that they're calling
and pulling out these viruses and bacteria
[SPEAKER_06]: and that there's actually methodologies
that are sound that can be doing so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't see why any type of large company
isn't looking for these type of
[SPEAKER_06]: propagators.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people are watching.
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave you the University in Japan to
go to and learn this.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of we need a lot of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow in the future when they have a
choice will take the safe road,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the clean road.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it as an opportunity for small
growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love cannabis to get to a point where
you could just open up the computer and be
[SPEAKER_08]: like, I'm going to order up some of these
different cultivars that I hear them
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then knowing with like it's amazing to
me how many people in the chat were kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of tripping.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, oh, they're hacking plants
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is some scientific GMO shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's literally telling you this is the
opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's taking fingerprints and marking a
plant so that if you order it,
[SPEAKER_08]: he can give you a guarantee and out of a
lab that's actually been validated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is not a cheap thing to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes a couple of years and it's
millions of dollars to validate a lab.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually cloning.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the first thing Ian ever told me
about Dr. Smiley said he's as much a
[SPEAKER_08]: farmer as he is a scientist and he has to
be an equal of both for this world to
[SPEAKER_08]: exist.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not callous tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is meristemic and to think that you
could order microplugs of safe genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a huge advantage to give.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the true gift for a patient.
[SPEAKER_08]: In my opinion, like if patients could be
ordering clean plants, do you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, let's all be honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not as easy as people sometimes say
it is to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like having a bloody puppy dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to take care of this thing or it's
going to die.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you really have to take care of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so to be able to order clean plantlets
and have that sort of advantage right from
[SPEAKER_08]: the beginning rather than get like mited,
aphid out, pests ridden, bacteria loaded
[SPEAKER_08]: virus and fungi the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you're supposed to grow something
with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, Oh my God, like 26 grams.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: They need the advantage.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also that way with seeds markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy seeds in the hope that they're
going to give you what the breeder has
[SPEAKER_01]: promised.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may or may not be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get one with 10 different
phenotypes in each seed batch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a virus in that seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, yeah, I didn't even want to get into
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or how many of those 27 potentially are in
that seed?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's great for initiation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it as a service.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you imagine if there was just a
facility one day where you can just bring
[SPEAKER_08]: your dirty ass, nasty infested fucking
plant, pay a fee.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in like six months, just like return
back and be like, have the chance to a put
[SPEAKER_08]: it into the library, you know,
especially if they fingerprinted and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: nothing they've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a part of anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: They connect it to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you somehow are making something off
that plant and you give it to them to let
[SPEAKER_08]: the rest of the world have access to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you give it to them only to hold just
for you, whatever your mentality is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just like the idea of being able to
clean the plants, make them available to
[SPEAKER_08]: people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly wouldn't like it if it just
got locked into like giant universities
[SPEAKER_08]: and it was like, oh, no, no random,
no regular people could access it or you
[SPEAKER_08]: could only buy the product.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so be it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's still probably going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I like the idea of it being available
to everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: That to me is a successful, successful
business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice if it was a little
faster, like a car wash, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that would, that's a, that's the
super duper future.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're, you're living in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even the super duper future of you
could actually test that seed to find out
[SPEAKER_06]: what viruses are actually inside there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to grow the plant out currently,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam to actually test seed embryos.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, that destroys the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you no longer have that seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with a little plant, but you just
need a punch of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_07]: Need the home unit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Need a home unit, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a home unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw you going in your garden and looking
at your garden like, yeah, that ain't
[SPEAKER_07]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I got like, I got plants
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got like, yeah, I'm just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do different feeding, different grow
meeting, see what's taking what under what
[SPEAKER_07]: LEDs and what's feeding better and seeing
what's, yeah, I'm just having fun,
[SPEAKER_07]: happy for months.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, but there's nothing sterile here
at all zero.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just kind of looking at,
you know, it's my own research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny, I've had a greenhouse for 30
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it would have, the plants wouldn't have
grown as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely a lot of fun looking at
how he's doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I did some of those first grows
with Cigar.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the strains right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that Mark?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I remember that first tissue culture
one and just thinking about that and just
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking how he's able to kind of keep
those strains alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the same time, just like you say,
disease bug free, everything that comes to
[SPEAKER_07]: your fresher curious after like 15 years
of having this strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what, what, where are the
problems?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it, it would be quite different
if you got it all cleaned up and
[SPEAKER_08]: initiated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love a mechanic shop where I could
take my plant in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you please pull this shit out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said earlier, can you imagine
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, clean your genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody would make a killing off of clean
your genetics company.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, but that would take decades to
even just get up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only clean your genetics, but imagine
taking a plant or seedling or a leaf or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: They examine the DNA and they say,
well, this plant has the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce a medium large amounts of THC,
medium large amounts of XYZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they know not only which compounds
they have the ability to produce,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in what sort of ratios and amounts
that will be the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be interesting to see anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the idea of clean genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel a lot of growers, you know,
are would, would probably instantaneously
[SPEAKER_08]: take the credit, but they're taking the,
you know, the grief when they're growing
[SPEAKER_08]: these plants that are just unable to
express themselves, even with fairly
[SPEAKER_08]: decent growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you get plants that are sick
enough and it's a, once they're sick,
[SPEAKER_08]: do you not agree, Sam, that they tend to
attack attract pests?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's like these little insects,
like just see that they're weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, because they, their resistance
is down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either dialed down or it just doesn't
exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those bugs see that in some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, everybody would prefer to have
the best, not only the variety they want
[SPEAKER_01]: that expresses the smells and effects and
tastes and cannabinoids they want,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they'd like the plant to be
dependable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't have health problems when
you treated it in the normal way you treat
[SPEAKER_01]: plants successfully.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's a, that's a lot to take in
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ian was going off on a pretty high level
of, of tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: My brain's mush, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: After that, I'm just like, I have,
I'm just right in my head.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_08]: me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You what?
[SPEAKER_06]: You love science.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't just like science.
[SPEAKER_06]: You passionately love science in a way
that porn producers could never get the
[SPEAKER_06]: pictures of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, science is almost a religion to me,
but I'm not a particularly religious
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_06]: But your perpetuation of science has
helped propagate generations of genetics
[SPEAKER_06]: that we wouldn't have known or had
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for your science nerdedness
and willingness to, you know, go there
[SPEAKER_06]: because, you know, you've, you,
you made your mistakes early on to
[SPEAKER_06]: realize, I mean, I would assume that you
realize early on that science was your
[SPEAKER_06]: friend and not your enemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and I can honestly say that
because most of my life I've been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: research and development that I often
learn more from mistakes than,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I definitely had made more
mistakes than successes, but you learn a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot when you remember don't do this and
intellectually you may know it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when you do do it, then you don't do
it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do it again when it's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now would they say Einstein made like over
a thousand mistakes before he invented
[SPEAKER_07]: them?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you just say Einstein invented the
light bulb?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I said that wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like a Johnny B quote.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going back and that's going to be,
that is going to be, I was going to use
[SPEAKER_08]: one of Ian's little audio bits for the
podcast, but now it absolutely has to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, did you just say Einstein
invented the light bulb?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you smoking, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that's some good shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's, it's been hanging for 30 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's getting me super stoned,
especially for breakfast.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like on like number like five or
six, plus I'm smoking the hash,
[SPEAKER_07]: the bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing dabs of the Congo.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a great day this hangover Sunday,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally agreed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to bounce some dude from the chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just kept saying the most ridiculous
shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's threatened by our conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember I talked about those little.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember, I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to be sending these out to
certain people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys know who you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please send me your mailing address.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can send these out to you at chat and
everybody else to play, follow the hashtag
[SPEAKER_07]: and that he wants and knows he issue very
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please contact me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm definitely a little momentum.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm a good friend of ours, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, I don't know if you guys want to
chat for another half an hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, I'm down with making it a couple of
hours, but I did just plan for a really
[SPEAKER_08]: short hash church this morning because it
was such last minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys had things you wanted to
discuss, I'm absolutely down.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've polarized the chat pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe it was just one guy had to bounce
from the chat because he was seemingly
[SPEAKER_08]: upset about our conversation about tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: He, he suggested that we were going to be
creating the technology and giving it to
[SPEAKER_08]: the sharks to rape us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel that some people are not puffing on
very good herbs these days.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that people are stressful and
are stressed out due to, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: this whole weird mind control thing
everyone's going through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like any other tool, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used for good or for evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just try to keep it good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying, you know, it's just Sunday
morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want everyone to have a good day and
enjoy each other's vibes and not to not
[SPEAKER_08]: give audience to, you know, cause we
worked hard for, for this audience.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a, if when I see people being
negative in the chat, I feel like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know what, there's just, you got to go
create your own audience for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to be here and enjoy and
spend, you know, spend your time and
[SPEAKER_08]: share, then everyone's welcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're going to be negative,
you gotta, gotta go for the hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: One last bong rip for the hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we lose Joshua?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he bounce?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is he still here?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, he's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was going to get in touch with Kevin
Jodfrey and see if he wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent him a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just here actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sterilizing my cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have four, you know, big clone or water
cloners, and it was on my list today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, there's a lazy part inside me
still, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, you know, I had this voice of
this, this guy ringing in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Oh, I just fucking put a little
bleach in there, run them and then go
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually work them down and scrub
them really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes me almost all day to clean my
four cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he said that I was like,
damn it, Rutherford, like do your thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean that shit up proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just started.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just torching a bowl and probably
nobody wants to hear the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I love the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, I'll just, I'll hop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm always thinking from,
uh, you know, I long time ago realized the
[SPEAKER_00]: food system and realized cannabis is going
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's taken a lot longer than I thought
it would take, but I'm okay with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm okay with the folks that want to
fuck us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, not really that, but I just am okay
that they exist and that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a reality and there, there's
going to be big, big mega cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to have a lot of bad impacts,
but it's also going to have a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have accessibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this whole mixed box, but I look
at like my place and our place in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's always like, we say the
smaller thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, yeah, let's let them
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're triploid, you know, fucking sour
dub that comes in at like 67%,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, total cannabinoids and blows
everyone out of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be here in a couple of
years and that's going to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have is something a lot more
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they cannot be produced, you know,
with our, our, you know, terroir,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, you know, whether it's
regional individual, the way we cultivate,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, you know, Just, and then,
and then thinking how does tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: play into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my like craft breeding program,
because there's no way I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: compete in my breeding with these,
these mega cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to focus on doing something
that's unique and, and then that someone
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to, you know, smoke because
they, they, they care about it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more rather than buying the
Costco weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just really interesting thinking
like, you know, maybe I need to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: this out on a small scale and set up a
small little sterile room so I can be
[SPEAKER_00]: running batches this way and breeding
larger batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just having the ability to
initiate your plants would be incredible.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you just have a little closet area
where you're like, I'm just going to clean
[SPEAKER_08]: my plants and you clean them and you
plant, plant them and start growing them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I saw some of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you breed with it, like you're
like, Hey, I'm going to, I'm going to set
[SPEAKER_00]: off this room for La Pala and I've got
everyone lined up what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's sterilize it all and then breed with
that clean and you'll make the best seed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to just run over you there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also listening, trying to talk to a
dude in chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was asking me something about like
PGRs.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, he can only get like three and
four star from PGRs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, well, no shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you, so your consideration then is
going towards something that's more
[SPEAKER_06]: artisan specific, artisan specific
genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, is that what you're considering?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artisan specific, you know, unique,
the old stuff, the stuff that doesn't work
[SPEAKER_00]: on mass scale, which is what I was doing
when I took a break and did tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: farming, I was growing these heirlooms
that no company can grow because they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't ship and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I grow them in regionally and
support just the local industry and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: drop off my heirlooms on Friday,
that they're going to cut up that
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon and serve Friday and Saturday
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked and I could get a high dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my whole like, you know,
I took a break from cannabis and learned
[SPEAKER_00]: all this by reading organic agriculture
books and how to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do all the things that we talk about,
take your product and stack the benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: by maybe make it into something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and just being an outlier and,
and, and not, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of gave in like, you guys won
a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have big business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to take cannabis where I love
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can I fit in this?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't think they realize how
cannabis is going to affect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that is the other factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what people, people should have
faith in cannabis because, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a reason why they kept it at bay
for so long and kept the nine foot steel
[SPEAKER_08]: door shut on cannabis for so long,
because even deep down, they have to know
[SPEAKER_08]: how deep it's going to get into everyone's
heads.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether they're wearing it or eating it
for health or taking different
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoids that are different from THC
or straight dabbing or recreational using
[SPEAKER_08]: or preventative using, or, you know,
the, the, the dozen new methods of using
[SPEAKER_08]: that will pop up over the course of the
next 10 or 20 years as the science gets
[SPEAKER_08]: deeper and the cultivars get, you know,
you know, bred and created that have
[SPEAKER_08]: higher contents of different cannabinoids,
different ratios.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, for one, I'm looking forward to
where we're going.
[SPEAKER_08]: With cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, look what they did with wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, wine, you know, they had bottles
of wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: They realized, well, I'm just selling
bottles of wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe if we create an area where people
can come and taste the wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I could see many cottage or artisan
cannabis doing exactly that model,
[SPEAKER_06]: creating a nice area, a beautiful
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: When people come in from when they drive
up to when they walk in, come sample the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's our smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Room, our ingestion room and create that
vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the way they'll sell their
genetics just the same way as there's
[SPEAKER_06]: certain vintners here in California that
only sell their wine through a mailing
[SPEAKER_06]: list or through their door, like visa to
eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll never find them in a store shelf,
but you'll go to that winery and pick up a
[SPEAKER_06]: couple of cases because that shit's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just produce enough just to sell
that way or through their mailing list.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I see that model definitely becomes
something that people want to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, I mean, you know,
it's, it's, it's becoming regional,
[SPEAKER_06]: like in the Humboldt or Mendocino,
some of those, the terroirs have now been
[SPEAKER_06]: set here in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that type of, you know,
Communal, but as well as for the artisan
[SPEAKER_06]: himself to show your wares, such as,
you know, here's, you know, you can show a
[SPEAKER_06]: glass off, you know, wall that shows the
actual cannabis growing, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, they can have the experience
of seeing it just like the wines growing
[SPEAKER_06]: there at the, you know, at the winery,
they get the whole experience there in a
[SPEAKER_06]: regional situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk in, you buy, you buy an ounce,
you get it, you get two grams of oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin, you get 10 cuts and you go home and
you get excited for six months or down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can call the, maybe you can
call, call me the breeder and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's going on with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: In July.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, Oh, Hey, I, you need a
compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll brew you one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come and pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that is, would be the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dreaming of that, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I, I, I'm sure it's going to be
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, I would not be surprised at
Costco and Kmart also have a tasting room,
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better for society, the wider it
spreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, some people like Bud,
some people like, you know, craft beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's room for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way it came in through medical,
it doesn't seem like they're going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: able to pull it away.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, here in Canada, we have,
it's very easy to get a license.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can grow your own, even if you don't
have a license, you can grow four plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone in the country that's over 19 can
grow four plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you want, you just go get yourself
a license and you can grow 30 or 50 or a
[SPEAKER_08]: hundred or 200, you know, well within
reason, it's not very difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, because cannabis is so effective
for inflammation, really anything with
[SPEAKER_08]: inflammation can get you a permit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm surprised no one's trying to do it
like Christmas tree places where you can
[SPEAKER_06]: come buy a live Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go cut your tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about that in Washington,
but it's all the laws, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been talking about that for
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically in COVID, it's kind of gotten
the legislators a little more open to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the things like,
Hey, we can bring a plant all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they don't have to pay for the
trimming, processing, drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can make it into oil, whatever they
need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could have a freezer on site.
[SPEAKER_06]: They could flash freeze it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's transportable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pushing this idea for 10,
20 years, and I absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And economically, I think if you grew a
hundred thousand plants and you sold them
[SPEAKER_01]: for $100 each for a plant that can yield a
kilo or two after it's cleaned and dried,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a lot of economic sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in California, the laws are in
the way at this moment, but we can change
[SPEAKER_01]: laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well we've established that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't like 215.
[SPEAKER_06]: We changed that and we don't like 64.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll change that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we just know what the parameters
are, we'll flick and fix it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did the same thing, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had that, the amazing group,
the coalition that took on with John
[SPEAKER_08]: Connor, I took on the federal government
here and just basically destroyed the
[SPEAKER_08]: federal government and maintain the
ability to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what the coalition did.
[SPEAKER_07]: The medical community got together and
fought for a cause and we won.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Patience stood up for their rights.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we stand up more for cannabis than we
have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's great to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need the rest of the world legalized.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't we?
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to do this for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's happening here in Canada and
different parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Access is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every person for any reason, anywhere in
the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about these Ammonita mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are like literally in the parking
lot of my work.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have those all over my yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are, they're all over Richmond.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all over Squamish, which is both
directions of my, from my house,
[SPEAKER_08]: North and South.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually just fairly prolific in
and around Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually took some a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did you like the Ammonitas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't you supposed to dry them and smoke
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that the- No, you don't have to
smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine were dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I collected them in Santa Cruz and it
gives you, it's sort of a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispersonalization drug and it makes you
sort of take big things where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: dreams that you can remember,
hallucination dreams or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my idea of a good clean
psychedelic, but there are people who
[SPEAKER_01]: liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the ancient Viking were called
berserkers because they would eat these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a funny thing about them is of course
that you could take the urine from a
[SPEAKER_01]: reindeer that ate them and it cleaned out
the impurities that made you more sick if
[SPEAKER_01]: you can swallow the reindeer piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the berserker Vikings would pee into
the bowls of their servants who would eat
[SPEAKER_01]: it, drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually had a better trip than
the berserkers because the mushrooms also
[SPEAKER_01]: have toxic chemicals, which are not passed
along, but the psychedelic is pretty much-
[SPEAKER_08]: The psychedelic doesn't metabolize in your
liver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Piss it out, active.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to harvest them,
it's good to try them, expose them to 130
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that 130 degrees Fahrenheit will break
down the hydrazine, I believe is the
[SPEAKER_02]: poison that causes the nausea.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Sam, have you drank actual reindeer
piss?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've never seen that or a berserker
piss, but I cannot recommend these to
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blurs your vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a true, clear psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't be eating it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you that much, but I find them
beautiful to photograph.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's really why I share them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always remind me of Santa Claus or
maybe it's cabalters.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, why don't I share my golden foots?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll put the golden foots up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These I'm going to be- I'm going to bounce
out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could talk about mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting really excited about it,
but I got some folks here, but- Dude,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's the season.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you're picking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you're picking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my son are into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a cool, fun thing that we're
learning together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine too, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're both just like- Dude, we got to talk
about it offline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good night and good afternoon,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for coming in, Josh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are edibles, chanterelles,
golden, sorry, yellow foots.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to go into some cream of
mushroom soup later today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I all froze up?
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw Johnny move, but Etienne's still
froze.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm moving.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you.
[SPEAKER_07]: My shirt, I think, and it's my friend of
mine made, has this brand, you see him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's all over Vancouver back in the days.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I trim, I wear my West Coast croppers
shirt, so it's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: West Coast croppers.
[SPEAKER_08]: West Coast croppers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, dude, thanks everyone for coming in
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate all of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm maybe going to go pick more
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's edible mushrooms out there and
they're only going to be going for so long
[SPEAKER_08]: before the season is over.
[SPEAKER_08]: I implore all of you to go for a hike in
the forest.
[SPEAKER_08]: See if you can't even just take some
pictures of mushrooms and check them out
[SPEAKER_08]: on the Google app with the camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can sometimes help identify.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, don't eat anything if you're
not practicing mycologist, but definitely
[SPEAKER_08]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's worth going into the forest and
photographing all these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to become a part of a really
great group on Facebook, I'll hit it up
[SPEAKER_08]: here real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a group called Mushrooms,
Wild and Mysterious, and then it says
[SPEAKER_08]: Seminar with Paul Stamets.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if my phone now won't let me
with the background.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out that Facebook group,
Mushrooms, Wild and Mysterious,
[SPEAKER_08]: Seminar with Paul Stamets.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can photograph mushrooms in and around
your place, put them up there,
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's incredible amounts of
mycologists.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ideally, if you're going to photograph a
mushroom for identification, you
[SPEAKER_08]: photograph under the gills as well as the
top and the side, three good photos,
[SPEAKER_08]: and to see what substrate it's coming out
of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't cut the mushroom off at the top so
you can't see what it's actually coming
[SPEAKER_08]: out of, whether it's wood and rot or life
or all these different things that
[SPEAKER_08]: mushrooms grow out of grass, etc.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit, even, for that matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Etienne Fontaine and Skunkman
Sam and Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: and Mike West, and thanks Josh and Colin,
who was here earlier, and of course Ian
[SPEAKER_08]: Davidson, who came and gave us the drop on
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been wanting them to come on for a
long time, so I was appreciating that,
[SPEAKER_08]: and really thanks, guys, for coming in
such a last minute and making a nice
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation happen today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the, I don't know,
443 people watching in chat live right
[SPEAKER_08]: now, I think they appreciate the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fairly polarized today.
[SPEAKER_08]: May the full melt bless your bowl sooner
than later, everybody, and peace out for
[SPEAKER_08]: now.
Peace.
Peace. Peace.
