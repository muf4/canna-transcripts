[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
and welcome back to high integrity glass
[SPEAKER_03]: art with mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rowe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see you buddy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm always this is like a kid in a
candy store when I come here I see you've
[SPEAKER_03]: got the ball rig on the table as well as
Ball Exo with major opal awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got a call today and it's a really
wonderful day because I'm getting to a
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care of a good buddy of mine and I'm
also able to pick up something that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been dying to get for quite some time So
why don't we just get right to it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the one tell me about the
Taurus
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've heard from quite a few people
that smoke a lot of motherships I think it
[SPEAKER_03]: was even both you and flab who just
mentioned that the Taurus has a Special
[SPEAKER_03]: hit for sure the recycler, you know,
I mean, yeah More flavorful I'm sure I've
[SPEAKER_03]: ever hit the Taurus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I've hit the ball and I know I've
hit about the FTK and the straight fab and
[SPEAKER_02]: the egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh right, you used to have a stick on the
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gosh I'm so stoked to open this up Wrap
them really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind that at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean really don't you want them to wrap
it really good?
[SPEAKER_03]: One level As you get down you can just
start feeling the solidity of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how like completely awesome it is
This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow That's a beauty right there Look at
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've definitely never hit one of
these before because I've never seen this
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of I guess that's how he's created
the recycler by the two opposing holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is unbelievable And then the what is
it called seed of life?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep Well, that's pretty damn sweet dude
Hats off to the mothership Now I say we
[SPEAKER_03]: might as well open up the egg because it's
going into the pelican case to go to its
[SPEAKER_03]: new home Probably the best way to ship an
egg wouldn't you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say so too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any real high-end glass it just makes
sense to get it in that Get it in that
[SPEAKER_03]: pelican case or turtle case or whatever
kind of case that you can find.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that's a nice sweet little bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really little bowl The
[SPEAKER_03]: eggs feel so great Such a big fan I only
really got into motherships in the last
[SPEAKER_03]: year, but I'm addicted This is how I got
mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pulled this right off my egg and got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are wrapped a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Yeah Tee man look at that beautiful
Real nice that one won't be getting hit
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this one go with this one actually?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one go with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or vice versa?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're all tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interchangeable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice teeny stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Right well I'm super stoked to get
this tortoise in action.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the deep dish banger here from
D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna go right in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Badoo Get this into position.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn it a little bit at an angle there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always good to make sure this isn't hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Click and what are we puffing on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably already told me twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chemo 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chemo 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I'm gonna be hitting some chemo 90
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really stoked on this little Yeah,
I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of going up she's just doing
circles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's about the right amount of
water right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each to each their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like it a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: That feels pretty good to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it's got a good drain too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god does that look unbelievable when
it drains.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a macro movie waiting to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are gonna love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling ya.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well super stoked that you guys are taking
care of I guess what do you got?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got right to the center of Canada or
we got British Columbia and Alberta?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two provinces that would otherwise
potentially not have motherships.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any motherships in Winnipeg?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well come on Winnipeg get on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just said he's taking care of Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can give him a call.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get in touch with him through
Facebook or Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our website will have a shop up in the
next two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude I'm telling you Spreezy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I not tell you about Spreezy?
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be photographing one of these
right now and selling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you it would be like that
fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spreezy.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway we're up to temperature here to
about 600.
[SPEAKER_03]: 661.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sitting at a solid 730.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you like the ready coil?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty beefy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The components look good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the big strong thick cable and it's
got a titanium nail on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I can't wait another minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: No need to wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give you guys a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabs up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deep dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Banger dabs out of the Taurus.
[SPEAKER_03]: You only get to hit your pipe for the
first time once.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you once again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really nice with the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just shuts it right down almost
completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got holes on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a hole right on the bottom but I
don't there's a dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that hole has something to do
with the way the quartz like right at the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom of the dish there's a hole and then
it's just like a little space that goes up
[SPEAKER_03]: to the flat dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured it was something to do to keep
the glass from exploding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it or the crystal the quartz
because I maybe if you seal it completely
[SPEAKER_03]: you can run into some issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured everything about these guys
Puking Beagle and the D-Nail guys they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't do anything just because.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single thing they do is like majorly
been designed thought of utilized and gone
[SPEAKER_03]: through like a long process of actually
getting to the point where okay this is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually a working model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man is that beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so happy I want to come back every
week and get one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I'm going to load one more up I
think.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else we got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some Congo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kimo?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kimo, Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: D420K is in the house as always D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta thank you once again man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean what a generous gift that was to
kick down that sort of amount of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been puffing it with everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone I puff it with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk about you and your kindness and I
give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring the fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about that D420K diesel
that's reminiscent of a Jilly Bean or an
[SPEAKER_03]: Agent Orange or a Callio or a Tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Velvet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the small compactness of this
piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's substantially smaller than the Yank.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even get a drop of water in your
mouth on this pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I probably sound like a total noob.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big recycler guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have hit quite a few pipes though and I
just have to tell you there's a I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: this pipe just gets to a certain point and
it's just the water spinning so hard at
[SPEAKER_03]: the top that when you stop pulling it
drops into this perfect funnel and
[SPEAKER_03]: actually starts dropping beadlets of water
through the tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you guys a macro show of the
nice clean pipe but later when I get time.
[SPEAKER_03]: For now I'm going to continue puffing
bowls out of this new piece giving much
[SPEAKER_03]: homage to Ro here at Higher End Glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry High Integrity Glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got so many names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Art in my head.

needs and thank you dude.
