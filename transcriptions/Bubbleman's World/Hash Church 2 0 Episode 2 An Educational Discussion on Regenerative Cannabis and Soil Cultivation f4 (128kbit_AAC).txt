[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, welcome, welcome to Hash Church
episode two.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Hash Church 2.0, and this is the
educational discussion on regenerative
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis and soil cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to tell you, I'm pretty excited
about this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little bit nervous.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing troubleshooting with all
the different new panelists, and I say
[SPEAKER_05]: let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to send the link out right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've got a really, really wonderful
panel that Dragonfly Earth Medicine has
[SPEAKER_05]: helped put together for us today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm excited about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell you guys are as well,
because we already have over 250 people in
[SPEAKER_05]: the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the link has just been sent out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hope and pray that it all works
wonderfully and everyone can click on that
[SPEAKER_05]: link and get in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we're going to be talking to
some pretty interesting people today about
[SPEAKER_05]: the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_05]: And about living soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got, well, I'll wait for
Dragonfly Earth Medicine to get into the
[SPEAKER_05]: room and help do the introductions for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see if we are going to get some
folks in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope everyone's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got 350 people in the room right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, Bubble Man did shave.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hi to everyone in the chat there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Kung Fu Vapes and Anne Bannister,
John Vidal, of course, Sal Shatino,
[SPEAKER_05]: Bing Go Lombardi, and 70s Momma,
Sam Allen, and Polar Bear, Skone Fark,
[SPEAKER_05]: Chelle Simpson, Trichome Farmer,
whole slew of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just going to get another email
ready just in case to make sure that that
[SPEAKER_05]: email went out properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Swami and Nikki in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy Sunday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Sunday as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragonfly Earth Medicine in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our first three panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very excited for today's conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very excited to hear both of you speak,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, I know about Swami Select,
but I've never had you guys on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very excited that Dragonfly Earth
Medicine helped facilitate you guys to
[SPEAKER_05]: both come in and chat with us this
morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thanks to all of you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And good morning, Josh and Kelly out there
too.
Hi, Josh.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: So nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to figure out our camera
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: For some reason, it's being on.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: So how are you feeling today?
[SPEAKER_15]: How's the farm?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the farm is kind of in winter sleep
mode.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had a bit of rain, which is quite
lovely because we've been more or less
[SPEAKER_14]: back into drought conditions for the last
three months up here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've had almost no rain.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now January is starting to bring some
rain.
[SPEAKER_14]: So things are coming alive.
[SPEAKER_14]: The moss is all green and so on.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's beautiful, actually.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's super good to hear.
[SPEAKER_15]: How's Tipu doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's right here with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tipu the Wonder Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you guys got some winter mode soil
building happening right now, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what happened is we put out some,
you know, soil builder, all those seeds
[SPEAKER_14]: and so on that we put out early.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the turkeys came along and ate
almost all of them.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've got another batch to throw out
right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to be doing that probably
tomorrow and early this week.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, soil building was a clover and
vetch and pea and fava and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_14]: to keep the soil alive.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Turkey mating season.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's about we have about 30 turkeys
that live in our meadow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dances with their feathers all spread out
about six males, six males with their huge
[SPEAKER_14]: fan.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really an exciting little and their
heads.
[SPEAKER_13]: So clearly they fly over the fence to get
to those seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't think they could do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they're crafty.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, they sleep up in the trees every
night, so they're probably wake up scoping
[SPEAKER_15]: the gardens and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's fun to see them fly into the
trees because they can't lift off very
[SPEAKER_14]: much.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's like a big 747 for them to
get that huge body up.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they kind of cruise up into the lower
branches of the trees.
[SPEAKER_13]: Poop can't be a bad thing in the garden.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, no, it's good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's definitely beautiful for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_15]: All poop is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just sent the email out again just to
make sure that everyone I've been in
[SPEAKER_05]: communication with almost everyone this
morning, but maybe the email didn't go
[SPEAKER_05]: through.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just sent it out again to make sure
that everyone else got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 13 different people that are going
to come in today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So excellent.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Scott.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're working on our camera here.
[SPEAKER_15]: So give us a minute to adjust.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the meantime, hey, Swami and Nikki,
it would be great to hear a little bit of
[SPEAKER_10]: a history about the Emerald Triangle and
tell us you all have been up there for a
[SPEAKER_10]: long time and maybe how things have
changed.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been up here, actually living up
here and growing up here since 2003,
[SPEAKER_14]: four.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we have many, many friends who've been
up here since the early 70s.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've just been talking with them the last
few days.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were always having friends send us
down a pound or so of a city.
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually grew my first crop in San
Francisco up on Telegraph Hill under
[SPEAKER_14]: Coyote Tower in 1977, 78.
[SPEAKER_14]: Had 13 little plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in those days, what I realized,
my big realization was the plants needed
[SPEAKER_14]: food.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have to admit, my first thing I gave
was Miracle Grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was like a miracle.
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazing to see why they really liked it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they responded.
[SPEAKER_14]: But after a while, the whole learning
curve of finding out how plants really
[SPEAKER_14]: live and the whole living soil thing
underneath the soil was a revelation to
[SPEAKER_14]: me.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so then we moved up here.
[SPEAKER_14]: We started to move much more and more
toward organic soil.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I have to admit, in the beginning,
I didn't know much about this.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would just go down to the local
nursery.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they had all these bags, these five
pound bags.
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's see, I probably got some green
sand, some oyster shells, what else was
[SPEAKER_14]: there?
[SPEAKER_14]: Volcanic rock, all these different things
that I would put in.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of those other things that we were
putting in.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just threw them in.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know anything about what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the plant teaches you, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: But they would need bushes to avoid plane
surveillance and so on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was actually up here more like 99.
[SPEAKER_13]: Still the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was when there were still
helicopters circling overhead.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you had to really learn how to be
invisible in the forest.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was kind of exciting in those days.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it was a different thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And things have really, really changed
because it used to be that it was the
[SPEAKER_13]: family a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: It started off as basically communes and
families up here that moved away just to
[SPEAKER_13]: get out of the city in the late 60s,
hippies that wanted to get out of the
[SPEAKER_13]: city.
[SPEAKER_13]: They moved up to the Emerald Triangle in
Columbus and probably had a lot of seeds
[SPEAKER_13]: and stems in it because it came from
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure they dropped in the soil and
they realized, wow, let's grow this up
[SPEAKER_13]: here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they can make a living this way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so then the people in the beginning,
it was, you know, in the first years up
[SPEAKER_13]: here, first decades, actually,
it was very scary because there were
[SPEAKER_13]: actually federal agents that would hang
out outside of nurseries to see who was
[SPEAKER_13]: going in to get a bunch of soil or stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So people had to be very clever.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, people had to make their own soil
from the stuff in the woods.
[SPEAKER_14]: And people would piss and jugs all winter
long and save their urine to put on the
[SPEAKER_14]: plants all summer long.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was one of those things you had to
be really secretive.
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to hide your your drip lines and
grow under the manzanita bushes.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you got four to five ounces per
plant, that was actually a pretty good
[SPEAKER_14]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there were people who are real,
real renegades who would hike back into
[SPEAKER_14]: the remote forest with no roads,
you know, 10, 20 miles back in and have a
[SPEAKER_14]: little renegade grow back there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, they call it the money
tree.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they'd come back out with a bag full
of stuff on their back and hitchhike into
[SPEAKER_14]: town.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very rustic and very isolated up here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And and I'd have to say, as far as the
quality of the cannabis, actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, I started smoking cannabis in
1969 and it was, you know, Mexican.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not very great.
[SPEAKER_13]: By the time people started growing up
here, even in the beginning, if they
[SPEAKER_13]: didn't know what they were doing,
it was still better.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was homegrown and everybody wanted to
get California homegrown.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even I mean, the 80s in the city,
we were selling people were selling
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis for like five hundred bucks an
ounce is what it was.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could get cannabis from the Emerald
Triangle or pot, whatever we called it
[SPEAKER_13]: back then.
[SPEAKER_14]: We.
[SPEAKER_13]: And as far as it was good, it was really
good.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a step.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to have a piece of that to
compare right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: To what?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the big breakthrough was what what
everybody called since Samia, because
[SPEAKER_14]: everything from Mexico was coming up with
seeds and stems and sticks.
[SPEAKER_14]: And at least half of your weight was
material.
[SPEAKER_14]: You couldn't actually smoke.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so in those days, it was a curious
thing that, you know, you had to surf
[SPEAKER_14]: through your your all your weed and get
the seeds and the stems out to finally
[SPEAKER_14]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then all of a sudden, but a boom.
[SPEAKER_14]: Samia comes in from up north or from
Hawaii, too.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was a revelation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so as far as I mean, we've been judges
in the Emerald Cup since it started 14
[SPEAKER_13]: years ago in 2003.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess you could say we've seen a
whole lot of cannabis go through this
[SPEAKER_13]: county in this area.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the quality has changed.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I've noticed the most that's changed
over the years is what gets entered.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd say when we first started doing it,
it was a lot more.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Emerald Cup in 2003, there was a lot
more skunky kind of varieties than it
[SPEAKER_13]: moved into a whole lot of cushions for
many years.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was almost all Kush.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was so Kush.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now it's getting into a lot more
flower and floral and fruity flavors that
[SPEAKER_13]: are coming in.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the few we still hang in, though.
[SPEAKER_13]: They do.
[SPEAKER_13]: They do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And people like that mix as taste change.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have definitely watched the taste change
of what people prefer.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's interesting over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to add that that when you said
the money tree, that reminded me of this
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful movie from 1992.
[SPEAKER_05]: About growers in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_05]: The story, if you haven't seen it,
absolutely find it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The crop is real in the movie.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very rare that you see real,
beautiful, incredible plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the story goes that the guy grew the
crop, filmed the movie and funded the
[SPEAKER_05]: movie with the crop he grew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's really quite a bee kind of
movie.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think as any grower from Northern
California, it's very much appreciative.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is called the money tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just had to mention that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm writing that down.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that was the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was this underground society.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the one thing that all of us
are kind of worried that we're going to
[SPEAKER_14]: lose.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was based on trust.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was based on knowing each other.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was based on face to face contact.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you just knew that you only needed to
knew two or three people and then you
[SPEAKER_14]: could get rid of your entire crop.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they only needed to know four or five
people.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was a really closed cell kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why so very few people really,
few people got busted and so on.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was just a trust thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a knowing, a secret society.
[SPEAKER_13]: And people shared information constantly.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, up until this very information.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, not just information, seeds and
starts and tips and how to fertilize,
[SPEAKER_14]: when to harvest, all those things.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because nobody knew anything about this
plant and self being taught.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have a few more panelists that just
came in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know all of their names,
but I would like to welcome them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Kolem.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's Kolem Riley.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's here from Malibu Compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Steve Cantwell.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Steve.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good morning, guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: From Indoor Grow up in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice to see you again.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a great time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, maybe once we get Scott O'grinnell
has been in here for a minute.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what's up, Scott?
[SPEAKER_15]: We should introduce ourselves for a
second.
[SPEAKER_15]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be awesome if we just
went through each person.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could give a little sort of
introduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did the same thing on the past,
present and future of hashish episode last
[SPEAKER_05]: week, just sort of like how long you've
been involved and how your passion got
[SPEAKER_05]: ignited to learn about the soil food web
and living soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So who would like to start?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Kolem would like to start.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, my name is Kolem.
[SPEAKER_11]: I started a compost company about eight or
nine years ago after having grown up on a
[SPEAKER_11]: farm and being around biodynamic farming
and kind of being around the entire large
[SPEAKER_11]: biodynamic farming process.
[SPEAKER_11]: And wasn't until I got more into
sustainability, corporate sustainability,
[SPEAKER_11]: the landscape side of it, that I started
exploring compost as the individual
[SPEAKER_11]: component and its effects in horticulture
and started the company mainly for
[SPEAKER_11]: backyard gardeners looking for a good
bagged alternative to grow food.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was through this community and some
people on this phone call and a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: their friends that really came to us and
started embracing the quality of compost
[SPEAKER_11]: and really then kind of started this
discovery of learning more and more about
[SPEAKER_11]: how to make the best compost in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the kind of focus of our company is
mainly just focusing on that high quality
[SPEAKER_11]: biodynamic compost, focusing on the role
of the cow, of the biodynamic and
[SPEAKER_11]: probiotic inoculations that are used in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: And through focusing on this singular
lifeblood of the soil and of the plant,
[SPEAKER_11]: still trying to incorporate a lot of the
more holistic principles of biodynamic
[SPEAKER_11]: farming, the closed loop.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the irony is I love to talk about
compost and we sell compost, but our
[SPEAKER_11]: passion is teaching people how to make
their own compost so they don't have to
[SPEAKER_11]: buy our compost so they can make their
own.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we can go to someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the intro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Scott?
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up with Scott?
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's it going, Scott?
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I'm Scott.
[SPEAKER_08]: So welcome, Internet Worlds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where does it start?
[SPEAKER_08]: I come from a agricultural background.
[SPEAKER_08]: My uncle's a produce broker.
[SPEAKER_08]: So from a young age, we were crawling into
fields and talking with farmers and that
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some high school friends went pretty heavy
into the indoor scene back in the mid
[SPEAKER_08]: 2000s.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to participate and see that action.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think where I really got inspired was
when people inside my growing circle
[SPEAKER_08]: started asking me for things like Eagle 20
and whatnot because they thought because
[SPEAKER_08]: my family was in agriculture that we had a
magic account to buy all kinds of
[SPEAKER_08]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that's actually when I
really started getting inspired because I
[SPEAKER_08]: figured if people were resorting to
horrific chemicals that you can't even
[SPEAKER_08]: access to deal with problems, someone
should actually look into the real
[SPEAKER_08]: solution.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I became literally obsessed with
finding out why cannabis gets powdery
[SPEAKER_08]: mildew and how do we get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's when I really became
inspired.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at a certain point, I was working
on the family.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't very big, but it was some
acreage and we wanted to try some teas.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I called into Forever Flowering to try
and get a hold of some of the Dragonfly
[SPEAKER_08]: Earth medicine products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was going to try to use the lush
roots and the brilliant black and whatnot
[SPEAKER_08]: at agricultural scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had a long conversation with Eric at
Forever Flowering and he encouraged me to
[SPEAKER_08]: look into elating them.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said something to the effect of,
you know, if there's money on the line and
[SPEAKER_08]: this is a important, you should get a hold
of Elaine and figure out how to use the
[SPEAKER_08]: microscope as an actual tool, not a casual
observation device.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that was in mid 2013.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that point, the only way to get a
hold of Elaine was you had to find her on
[SPEAKER_08]: the road somewhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so at that time, she didn't have her
classes.
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as she offered her online classes,
we went pretty heavily with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've pretty much been obsessed with
using a microscope.
[SPEAKER_08]: To count organisms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we work with commercial
facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the last couple of years, my wife and I
have positively influenced well over a
[SPEAKER_08]: million square feet of indoor cultivation
and a considerable amount of outdoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're starting to get into the bigger
greenhouses with California going rec.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like today, I'm in a hotel and in the
middle of nowhere working on a 50,000
[SPEAKER_08]: square foot greenhouse, which is pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: So currently living, yeah, currently
living what I would consider a dream
[SPEAKER_08]: situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm super thankful that I've been
completely obsessed with how to produce
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis free of pests and disease without
using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now's the time to execute.
[SPEAKER_08]: So things are good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wonderful, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a super crucial tool to us all
doing the living soils.
[SPEAKER_15]: And these kind of biological systems and
knowing that the flavor is the best
[SPEAKER_15]: through that, you know, and just wanting
to be able to bring that to scale so that
[SPEAKER_15]: the masses could have it and not all just
your good friends.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, hey, Steve, what are you what's
going on down in Nevada?
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you tell us a quick thing about
green life productions and yourself and
[SPEAKER_10]: your soils that you've been working with
and how you came to know that you're
[SPEAKER_10]: doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_07]: The last part.
[SPEAKER_10]: How you came to the program that you're
working on right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so yeah, my name is Steve Cantwell.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up heavily involved in mixed
martial arts, kickboxing, jiu jitsu,
[SPEAKER_07]: MMA, UFC, all that cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got into cannabis just after years and
years of just physical abuse to my body
[SPEAKER_07]: and just kind of looking for that long
term solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always grew up smoking pot though my
whole life for the most part.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I started getting real heavily
into cannabis towards the end of my career
[SPEAKER_07]: in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sustained some pretty bad injuries over
time and didn't give them the proper time
[SPEAKER_07]: to heal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kept competing on top of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Injury after injury.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I found cannabis and it was really
helped me not just mask my injuries,
[SPEAKER_07]: not just help me with the pain,
but I felt like it was actually helped me
[SPEAKER_07]: heal my injuries.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was kind of a big eye opener.
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt healthy, felt good about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got dove into the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Learned about the plant, learned how to
grow my own medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was a patient for years under the Nevada
Medical Marijuana Patient Program.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then yeah, then the recreational scene
kind of started popping up, or at least
[SPEAKER_07]: the medical scene, regulated medical
scene.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was lucky enough I reached out to
some former sponsors of mine that
[SPEAKER_07]: sponsored me in the UFC, some small town
Floyd's Ace Hardware, the Floyd family out
[SPEAKER_07]: in Pahrump.
[SPEAKER_07]: They put together a good local team.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just built out the best facility,
the most regenerative facility we could at
[SPEAKER_07]: the time, being that we were the first to
actually get up and going in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no regulations as far as
greenhouses go, pesticides, things like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we went big on the indoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our goal has been to be like the most
sustainable indoor facility possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do everything we can to care about what
we're doing, not just the product,
[SPEAKER_07]: but the environment as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we introduced living soil to indoors on
a large commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been extremely successful.
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't mean that we haven't had
problems with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't mean we haven't learned our
lesson here and there, learned what to do,
[SPEAKER_07]: what not to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the most part, we've had an
extremely blessed opportunity to work with
[SPEAKER_07]: and meet so many amazing people like
yourself, Josh and Kelly, like Scott and
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarah, like other people in the industry
that just kind of shared their passion
[SPEAKER_07]: with us and kind of shared their
techniques and their techniques and
[SPEAKER_07]: experience and everything that they have
to offer to the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just soak it all in, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been doing the best we can,
working through these regulations,
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to put out the best, cleanest,
safest product possible while,
[SPEAKER_07]: again, contributing to a clean,
safe environment and cultivating this
[SPEAKER_07]: plant responsibly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like Nick and Liz have joined us
just now from Green Source Gardens also.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Nick and Liz, can you guys come on
now?
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll figure out how to unmute their
microphone here shortly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think their microphone's muted,
but it's okay to have some technical
[SPEAKER_05]: difficulties.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how we learn to make things flow
wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't mind a little hiccup and a bump
here and there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just, I want to tell everyone that
I'm super excited to get into this
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation today and have you all here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really lovely.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that we can take this conversation
and get a little more directed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was wondering maybe if we'd start
with the compost, maybe a column,
[SPEAKER_15]: and you could go a little deeper and tell
us about biodynamics and maybe some about
[SPEAKER_15]: Rodeale and composting historically and
how it affects your piles and what makes
[SPEAKER_15]: it, how the biodynamic preps really,
really help the piles differently than a
[SPEAKER_15]: regular compost.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and also since you all are,
you know, working with a lot, I know that
[SPEAKER_10]: you have a lot of other agricultural
people that you're working with,
[SPEAKER_10]: but you are working a lot in the cannabis
industry and maybe how you're,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, making your compost and things
that's particular to the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_10]: and to particularly to the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, those, those are all great
questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would typically say that, you know,
compost has four main elements.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's earth, water, air, and fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you think about compost just in the
broader sense is it's not, and this is the
[SPEAKER_11]: right audience.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's even in the agricultural circles,
compost is oftenly thought of as the stuff
[SPEAKER_11]: that you sort of throw away or you stick
in a corner of the farm and just let it
[SPEAKER_11]: break down and then you go back and you
use it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And not this active process, but it's
really a process between the decomposing,
[SPEAKER_11]: but also using that root word,
the composition.
[SPEAKER_11]: So going into making your own compost is
understanding that there's a composition
[SPEAKER_11]: to this that, and this is where I stress
then when it comes into most compost
[SPEAKER_11]: operations that you see, it's the
difference between organics recycling
[SPEAKER_11]: versus intentional composting.
[SPEAKER_11]: And organics recycling is what happens
under a tree.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's when you combine a bunch of
materials, you recycle organic material or
[SPEAKER_11]: you divert material out of the landfill,
all of which have their place and are
[SPEAKER_11]: absolutely critical for our whole
survival.
[SPEAKER_11]: But besides the organics recycling,
there's intentional composting and
[SPEAKER_11]: intentional composting though.
[SPEAKER_11]: You really should still start from the
perspective of what do you have the most
[SPEAKER_11]: of on your own land and then build from
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in Malibu's it's slightly different
because if we said we're gonna start
[SPEAKER_11]: intentionally composting, we wanna make
one of the best compost known to man.
[SPEAKER_11]: We looked at a lot of different methods
and we looked at the biodynamic method.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll get into a few of the reasons for
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But one of which then was looked at the
cow.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in my situation, I don't own a dairy
farm, I don't own a lumber mill,
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't own any type of operation where I
have a lot of byproducts.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in our company, we went out to go get
the byproducts.
[SPEAKER_11]: In your situation, you might have a very
wooded property or you might have a farm
[SPEAKER_11]: nearby or a vegetable processing facility.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in your situation, you might work
backwards based on what can you get your
[SPEAKER_11]: hands on the most and then build your
recipe from there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we started with the cow.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the reasons is the female
mother dairy cow, the truly organic mother
[SPEAKER_11]: dairy cow who's outside eating grass,
who's already given birth to a calf,
[SPEAKER_11]: produces very specific enzymes in her
digestive system.
[SPEAKER_11]: And not only are you looking at the same
probiotics that go through and come out in
[SPEAKER_11]: mother's milk that you'll find used for
kefir and for yogurt cultures and all
[SPEAKER_11]: these living properties and enzymes in the
milk, it comes out in the manure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Secondly, there's also this balance in the
manure because of the cow's digestive
[SPEAKER_11]: system.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the bacterial, the beneficial fungi,
everything within that cow's system
[SPEAKER_11]: produces a perfectly balanced manure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Chicken manure is very hot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Horse manure is very dry and fibrous.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pig manure is great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sheep manure is great.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have tons of different characteristics
of manure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Each one produces a different bulk density
when it's finished, produces a different
[SPEAKER_11]: pH when it's finished, has different
organic nitrate characteristics to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're all kind of have their
different things.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we use that.
[SPEAKER_11]: The second, though, is the cow,
because of eating all the grass,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's this kind of connection between
what the pasture needs and taking from the
[SPEAKER_11]: pasture and giving back to the pasture.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's almost as if the cow is sort of
balancing that level of fertility in the
[SPEAKER_11]: soil as it goes along.
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing that we find is,
and I'll let Scott talk a lot more to
[SPEAKER_11]: this, with just the beneficial bacteria,
the beneficial fungi, the living aspects
[SPEAKER_11]: of this finished compost.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when people look at a lot of the
aspects of biodynamic or organic,
[SPEAKER_11]: they're always trying to point fingers at
what it is or what it isn't.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you prove this?
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you prove that?
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of the purists just say,
well, my plants taste better.
[SPEAKER_11]: My plants are stronger.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the Cal Poly and UC Davis things
say, well, there's no negligible proof
[SPEAKER_11]: that we can come up with.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we're seeing a lot on one
scientific concept I'll introduce is SAR,
[SPEAKER_11]: systemic acquired resistance.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it sounds complicated at first,
but systemically acquiring resistance to
[SPEAKER_11]: pests and disease.
[SPEAKER_11]: And plants do this in the same form and
fashion that kids who are allowed to go
[SPEAKER_11]: outside and play in the dirt do.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're three times more likely not to
contract asthma and respiratory diseases.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kids who grow up on farms around manure
who play in the dirt are more likely not
[SPEAKER_11]: to get sick.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's an anti-bleach effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: It builds up acquired resistance in your
system.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the plants do this as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: If they have a healthy soil with a healthy
biological diversity to pull from,
[SPEAKER_11]: they are going to become stronger.
[SPEAKER_11]: So compare apples to apples in the same
exact environments.
[SPEAKER_11]: There might not be that much of a
difference.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you introduce pests or disease or
any of these stress factors, drought,
[SPEAKER_11]: heat, any of these stress factors that
we're seeing now more and more due to
[SPEAKER_11]: climate change, plants become stronger
because they have a healthier ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're also treating the soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're treating the entire biological
intelligence in the soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's directly stolen from Green
Source Gardens, the concept of biological
[SPEAKER_11]: intelligence planted between.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will keep stealing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: So every compost has these different
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_11]: So really, we're looking for that rich
characteristic.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you're blending your carbonaceous
materials in your manure, that's your
[SPEAKER_11]: earth element of your compost.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you think of the four elements,
your carbon and nitrogen ratio,
[SPEAKER_11]: that's your earthly component.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a certain ratio that it has to
fall in or the pile is not going to work.
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, that's why I say work backwards
from what you have in the highest volume
[SPEAKER_11]: and tweak your recipe.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going from there because your compost
is going to shrink 50, 60, possibly even
[SPEAKER_11]: 70 percent.
[SPEAKER_11]: We find moisture is a difficult variable
to control, especially here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_11]: We use some breathable covers on the
compost piles in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_11]: We build the piles much bigger when they
start out in the summertime and almost use
[SPEAKER_11]: like a layer of straw on the outside to
insulate it because moisture is your other
[SPEAKER_11]: variable.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not going to be able to start a
pile with a moisture above 65 or 70
[SPEAKER_11]: percent, but you're not going to be able
to get a pile to go and truly finish if it
[SPEAKER_11]: starts out at 40 percent or less.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you want a good moisture characteristic
in your compost pile to end up with a good
[SPEAKER_11]: moist compost that allows a lot of that
life to breathe.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is all going and air is the next
factor.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have water, earth and air.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the air, the pile wants to breathe
from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a lot of people don't understand it's
how you construct your piles that adding
[SPEAKER_11]: porosity in the bottom of the pile allows
the oxygen to circulate, which is going to
[SPEAKER_11]: allow the final variable of heat.
[SPEAKER_11]: So earth, air and water, you can control
and heat is the final byproduct of all of
[SPEAKER_11]: this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, certainly, you know, it's exciting to
have Jeff on the call.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll let him talk a lot more about the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we're looking in the compost is
to heat the pile above 133 degrees.
[SPEAKER_11]: We want the thermophiles to show up,
all the beneficials that show up above 133
[SPEAKER_11]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we don't want that pile to crack 160
degrees because at 160 degrees,
[SPEAKER_11]: some of those beneficial microbes start
dying off.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a delicate balance.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to get the pile to peak up
and to get to a certain level and then
[SPEAKER_11]: allow it to go to this kind of cooling
down mesophilic stage of the compost.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, in the biodynamic practice,
we use specific inoculations.
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are extracts that you'll hear
and you'll find at your same health food
[SPEAKER_11]: store.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dandelion, chamomile, yarrow, silica,
oak bark.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, you might not find the silica at the
health food store, but you'll find a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: of these at the health food store because
there's healing properties.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, they're composted themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just the yarrow, for example.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the leaf.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the flower of the yarrow plant that's
been juiced and pressed and hung out to
[SPEAKER_11]: dry and fermented through its own process.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then buried into the compost pile as
an inoculant.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is where I go back to this whole
concept that when you're making
[SPEAKER_11]: intentional compost, you're composing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what's exciting is to see so many
people in this world, especially now when
[SPEAKER_11]: you go to the question Kelly asked about
how do you make compost for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: world, you say, well, what do my plants
need that might be more unique to that
[SPEAKER_11]: crop?
[SPEAKER_11]: And how can I compose this pile of
material in my backyard or in my garden?
[SPEAKER_11]: To get this end result.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you see people now growing aloe and
comfrey next to their compost pile to
[SPEAKER_11]: include into the compost.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can take worms and add it to the
compost.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can put biochar into the compost.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can add rock dust into the compost or
into the work pile.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're utilizing these components that
you might be adding later on to the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead, what you're doing is you're
utilizing them to add to the compost to
[SPEAKER_11]: allow it to go through this transformative
process.
[SPEAKER_11]: All these materials together to homogenize
and to diversify.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're essentially you're building your
own compost by growing and adding these
[SPEAKER_11]: other unique inputs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Free soil application, which just,
in my opinion, makes it far more effective
[SPEAKER_11]: and makes the entire soil far more mature.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it just reinforces this concept when
you have truly healthy soil and healthy
[SPEAKER_11]: components and a lot of biological
diversity, especially adding some of these
[SPEAKER_11]: natural materials that are used by humans
and plants and have medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to grow strong plants and
every plant is going to be an expression
[SPEAKER_11]: of that unique soil, which then we can
also talk later about the concept of
[SPEAKER_11]: terroir.
[SPEAKER_11]: But terroir is really expression of that
unique characteristic of that soil and
[SPEAKER_11]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Rather than using pesticides or fertilizer
or anything from somewhere else to kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: create a generic baseline, you're
enhancing the uniqueness of all these
[SPEAKER_11]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's one of the things we love.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in Oregon, we use Oregon cows.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Oregon compost has Oregon based
mycorrhizae in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've learned about our compost from cover
crop experts who have stopped inoculating
[SPEAKER_11]: their cover crop, but use a dusting of
Malibu because it contains indigenous
[SPEAKER_11]: mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that's over my head.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't specialize in mycorrhizae,
but that's the beautiful thing about this
[SPEAKER_11]: community is sometimes you just learn so
much more than you ever think you have to
[SPEAKER_11]: teach by talking to people who use your
product and share your same passion.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the beauty of the community,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Colin.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was really awesome and totally
complete.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that, you know, there are going to
be a lot of questions as we go into this,
[SPEAKER_10]: but learning about compost is just such an
amazing basic thing to understand living
[SPEAKER_10]: soils.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or a base thing for our farm, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or even an inoculant, like you were
saying, you know, we've used Malibu
[SPEAKER_10]: compost as an inoculant into our teas,
you know, as much biodiversity as we can
[SPEAKER_10]: have.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're always looking for good positive
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this helps us get into Jeff now that
he's here and maybe dive into some of the
[SPEAKER_15]: microbes and the fungi.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you just got done finishing teaming
with fungi.
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe you can tell us a little bit
about what's going on with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a little bit about yourself and your
new book, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'd love to hear about what's been
going on with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that you can add a lot more to
what Colin just said as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got to unmute his mic first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, by the way, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll click on the old mic and we will
hear what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're still muted.
[SPEAKER_10]: Try to unmute.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_12]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm an old man, you know.
[SPEAKER_12]: This technology is really hard.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in Anchorage, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's still dark.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are my greenhouse lights.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's below freezing here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, other than that,
everything is just fine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wrote three books.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to call myself Lord of the Roots,
teaming with microbes, teaming with
[SPEAKER_12]: nutrients and teaming with fungi.
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, all three of them have a
lot to do with compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or I should say compost has a lot to do
with all three of them, because as far as
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm concerned, compost is the base.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you don't have great compost,
you don't have a good base.
[SPEAKER_12]: Compost, you're not going to have great
plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just all there is to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can make it or you can buy it or
you can buy it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you can add to it to make your
own, which is I think what Carmen was
[SPEAKER_12]: getting at there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, his products are all Oregon
products.
[SPEAKER_12]: His microbes are as much Oregon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: I live in Anchorage, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to have indigenous microbes from my
area.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I will take Malibu compost and I'll
add some Alaska humus or some of my own
[SPEAKER_12]: compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: into it so that I get my local microbes in
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that I've learned over
the years, reading about compost and
[SPEAKER_12]: dealing with compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, you know, pretty much anybody
that's into growing knows how to make
[SPEAKER_12]: compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not everybody knows how to make it as well
as the biodynamic folks do, but I think we
[SPEAKER_12]: all make compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: But over the past five or 10 years,
the big advice addition, there's been two
[SPEAKER_12]: of them that I've been given and that I
think are very, very worth following.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first is to add up to 10% clay into
your mix.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's obviously because the clay has
electric properties that enable it to hold
[SPEAKER_12]: on to some of the microbes as well as lots
of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think people don't often remember that
microbes can have an electric charge on
[SPEAKER_12]: them as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so adding 10% clay into your compost
pile obviously has been very, very
[SPEAKER_12]: effective for that reason.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other thing is, I know that
people think that compost has mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_12]: fungi in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Very often, there will be mycorrhizal
fungi in compost because it blows in from
[SPEAKER_12]: the area where it's being made.
[SPEAKER_12]: But generally, the number of spores of
mycorrhizal fungi in compost is either low
[SPEAKER_12]: or none.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what you need to do is really add
mycorrhizal fungi into compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the particular instance of
cannabis, there's really only one
[SPEAKER_12]: mycorrhizal fungi that works.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so after you make your compost and
right before you apply it and use it,
[SPEAKER_12]: then you want to add the rhizophagus
interacetes.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the only mycorrhizal fungi that
does anything with regard, as far as we
[SPEAKER_12]: know, with regard to the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it can be in your compost because
it blows in.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got plants or you've got spores
that are in the near vicinity,
[SPEAKER_12]: but generally, you need to add mycorrhizal
fungi to compost because the mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_12]: fungi are attracted by the roots,
which send out a signal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you don't have living roots in your
compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they're not sending out that signal
to generate the mycorrhizal populations.
[SPEAKER_12]: The age of the compost, I think,
is pretty important.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people use their compost when
it's way too young.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that has two implications.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first is that the compost might not
really fully be compost yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Compost piles have to be turned if you're
making active compost as opposed to static
[SPEAKER_12]: compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what people have found is that most
compost piles are not turned enough or
[SPEAKER_12]: completely.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that there are areas of the compost
that don't go through the 133 degree
[SPEAKER_12]: heating process.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have the potential, if you use manure
in your pile, of containing E.
[SPEAKER_12]: coli.
[SPEAKER_12]: But more important, you're not going
through the composting process,
[SPEAKER_12]: or as important I should say, you're not
going through the composting process if
[SPEAKER_12]: you don't continually turn and make sure
that all the material in the pile is
[SPEAKER_12]: composted.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's really kind of key.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I think a lot of people don't test
their compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, depending on what you put in your
compost, and Colin is absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we tend to do is take compost and
we make designer compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: All of us that are growing our own
cannabis, making our own compost,
[SPEAKER_12]: we're tweaking our compost, trying to make
the very best compost we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we add stuff to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've got to really think about how
we're making our designer compost and
[SPEAKER_12]: whether it's what we really want to have.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for cannabis plants, our cannabis
plants, we know like a more bacterial soil
[SPEAKER_12]: than a fungal soil in terms of dominance.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you can add more green material and
make your compost a more bacterially
[SPEAKER_12]: oriented compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can, as Colin said, add in the things
that you would normally put in your plant
[SPEAKER_12]: as fertilizers or into your soil to feed
the microbes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: You feed the compost and you can end up
using up to up to three quarters less.
[SPEAKER_12]: So in other words, up to one quarter of
the quantity of the stuff that you would
[SPEAKER_12]: normally need, you can use in the compost
pile much, much less because it gets
[SPEAKER_12]: worked into the bodies of the microbes,
which ultimately hold these nutrients and
[SPEAKER_12]: then ultimately end up feeding the plants
as we know.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, I don't think there's really too
much more to add.
[SPEAKER_12]: Compost is it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where I was getting at was that you've got
to test the compost to make sure that
[SPEAKER_12]: you're loading your plants with the right
ratios of material.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want to end up with way too much
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that can happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you make your compost one way,
it'll end up with tremendous amounts of
[SPEAKER_12]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you have too much phosphorus,
then once you do use the compost,
[SPEAKER_12]: things happen that don't happen if you
don't have so much phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't attract the mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your plants don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you don't get the same soil structure.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't get the same inputs coming in
from the mycorrhizal fungi and from the
[SPEAKER_12]: biology, biology that surrounds the
mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you got to really kind of fool around
and tweak what you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the things you got to do is you
got to test your stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Testing is knowledge and information is
power.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you don't test your compost,
even though it costs a little bit of
[SPEAKER_12]: money, you know, I think you're making a
big mistake.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I say testing, I think you need
to test for several things.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you need to test it for MPK.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you need to test it for the fungal
bacterial ratio and maybe which one is
[SPEAKER_12]: active versus which one isn't.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a soil food web test.
[SPEAKER_12]: And lately I've been talking about a new
kind of test called a microbial biomass
[SPEAKER_12]: test where you can actually measure the
microbial density of your soil,
[SPEAKER_12]: the microbial biomass of your soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: This wasn't possible before without
spending a tremendous amount of money.
[SPEAKER_12]: But now there's something called a
microbiometer, which you can get off the
[SPEAKER_12]: internet.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's going to be distributed now in
stores because they just made deals with
[SPEAKER_12]: several big distributorships.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for $10, you can test your soils to
see whether your microbiomass,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is really correlated, high biomass,
good nutrients, low biomass, not so good
[SPEAKER_12]: nutrients, and you can correlate with what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're adding something into your
compost, is it improving the biomass of
[SPEAKER_12]: your compost?
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're putting your compost down on
your plants, you can test them to see
[SPEAKER_12]: whether that compost is improving and
increasing the biomass in the soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very interesting new way of
measuring stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think you need to do those three
tests.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, the MPK is the other one.
[SPEAKER_12]: And once you do that, you get a real feel
for what you're doing and what you're
[SPEAKER_12]: making with your compost.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's super important.
[SPEAKER_15]: It tells us about the microorganisms,
their role.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it really is teaching us that part of
climate change is agriculture.
[SPEAKER_15]: A really big thing is runoff.
[SPEAKER_15]: And dead zones in the ocean have a lot to
do with agricultural runoff going into the
[SPEAKER_15]: ocean and killing the micro life and
everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's a huge importance, is retaining
what you're putting in.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just don't want to throw your money
away.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you don't want to throw crucial inputs
away.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're hard earned microbes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, in the end, it gives you a good
product of hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we're on a hash church,
after all.
[SPEAKER_15]: And to bring in the right trichomes,
to have a diverse microbial system in your
[SPEAKER_15]: soil is going to give you really good
plant health and then also hash
[SPEAKER_15]: production.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought that it would be nice to
introduce a few more people that are on
[SPEAKER_15]: the panel and then possibly move in to
keep going with the science aspect of it
[SPEAKER_15]: and talk to Scotto about some of the soil
tests he's been doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so let's move on to you,
Dan.
[SPEAKER_10]: And go ahead and talk a little bit about
your farm and what it is that you do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we know that you're running a rec
farm, a really large rec farm in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're doing it all organically and
way beyond your peer certified farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you guys are doing really awesome
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell us a little bit about who you are.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what you're doing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my partner, Dan and I have been
working together building organic soil for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production for quite a few years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a real learning curve to
find a lot of these elements of diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: and balance that are being referenced
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently working up to scale for
our tier two license in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running about 5,000 square feet of
light assisted greenhouse canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a few thousand square feet
of outdoor canopy, which is sheltered
[SPEAKER_00]: under the protection of hoop houses with
some environmental control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Components in there being as we are just
south of Portland up in the northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Willamette Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture is always a challenge for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of climate control
equipment that we need to employ in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to maintain consistency in our production
year round, which is a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're kind of figuring our way and how
to set up these greenhouse houses properly
[SPEAKER_00]: to utilize as much benefit of the sun as
we can and just really work towards
[SPEAKER_00]: minimizing our energy consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do see an important niche in the
market for producing extremely high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, indoor quality type of flour to
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so much of that slice of the market is
consumed by warehouse grows that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: many regards throwing a lot of energy out
the door and not utilizing the benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: that the sun gives us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our primary model right now is
the light assisted greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been fortunate to find a nice
piece of land that we moved into a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of years ago that's got pretty solid
native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little high in clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built our sort of custom gnome soil
blend with a lot of Malibu compost is
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And diversity as keeps coming up,
diversity is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've turned to some other local
compost suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Jeff referenced, we've really
learned the value of testing the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some rough and tumble along the
way through building certain batches,
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies of soil, as I think of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit willy nilly along the way as
far as we'll just say, hey, we'll take we
[SPEAKER_00]: like this fungal, you know, mushroom based
compost, and we like this real bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: based mint compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll combine it with a healthy percentage
of Malibu produced across the valley from
[SPEAKER_00]: us here in Oregon, bringing in a lot of
the indigenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collect indigenous microorganisms from
our own farm and are regularly
[SPEAKER_00]: distributing those, inoculating the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just sort of had a general
sense of a blanket amendment mix that
[SPEAKER_00]: would add value nutrient from a nutrient
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just kind of had some mixed
results along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing too bad, but you definitely see
when things are really aligned and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity is working well together and
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality of growth and production that
we see is, you know, that's the goal in
[SPEAKER_00]: all cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've really had to learn to understand
all these very complex soil analysis and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the balance between all the
primary and secondary nutrients and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is a web of information that
sometimes can be a challenge to unfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just through looking at a lot of data
here in the last couple of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: things have really started to slip into
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've learned that we can't
necessarily just take for granted that if
[SPEAKER_00]: we employ a certain X, Y, Z, we're going
to consistently have the same result
[SPEAKER_00]: unless we are very clear on what X,
Y, and Z represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been really exciting to learn and
apply a lot of these understandings at the
[SPEAKER_00]: scale that we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking to expand in the next year
to the full scope of our license,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be nearly double the production
that we're currently at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like we're primed really
well to rise up as we expand the market
[SPEAKER_00]: here and try to just hold our own as we're
facing pretty massive oversupply issues
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the state.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_15]: We really appreciate that information.
[SPEAKER_15]: Each farm has such a unique story and
we'll just move right on to Nick and Liz
[SPEAKER_15]: from Green Star so you can introduce
yourself and explain a little bit about
[SPEAKER_15]: your farm.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll keep moving through the people
and then we'll get to more conversation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if Nick and Liz can hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Nick and Liz.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it starts to... Kind of a weird spice.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are Green Star's Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Elizabeth and I.
[SPEAKER_15]: It might not work very well.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are coming in and out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's probably... Shoddy satellite
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we won't be able to take part.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we love and appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: There might be a way, actually,
if they go to the bandwidth button at the
[SPEAKER_05]: top of the screen, it looks like a Wi-Fi
signal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you click on that adjust bandwidth
usage, you might be able to take it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it usually is in the auto HD top
spot and you can slide it all the way down
[SPEAKER_05]: to the left.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't have a camera on, but it might
be able to allow your voice to come
[SPEAKER_05]: through better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it sound?
[SPEAKER_15]: That sounds pretty good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it sound better?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, maybe.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, anyway, so let's go to Duke.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys are worried about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we're, you know, we're working
through it, but that's the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess, you know, I guess I could
take a minute and just introduce you guys
[SPEAKER_10]: a little bit, because I feel like I know
you all so well and you all are now family
[SPEAKER_10]: to us.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've been out to your farm,
but Nick and Liz's farm out in Green
[SPEAKER_10]: Source is in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_10]: They moved on to their farm last year.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this was their second year cultivating
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a rec farm and they took a whole
hillside and turned it into beautiful
[SPEAKER_10]: terraces through hugelkultur.
[SPEAKER_15]: They mounted it on top of rocks.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a fairly rocky soil, which a lot of
people feel like that makes it to where
[SPEAKER_15]: you can't grow things.
[SPEAKER_15]: But they showed that a little effort and a
lot of love, you can bring the sticks out
[SPEAKER_15]: of the forest and you can have wonderful
animals and they can help transform the
[SPEAKER_15]: soil with, you know, some faith and hard
work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Nick and Liz really haven't brought
anything onto their property except for
[SPEAKER_10]: local, you know, no spray, all organic
hay.
[SPEAKER_10]: They feed it to their animals and then
transfer all the compost onto their soil
[SPEAKER_10]: beds with a tremendous amount of
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're utilizing king stropharia
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_10]: They are utilizing comfrey and all
different types of wonderful companion
[SPEAKER_10]: planting as well as food.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're pulling potatoes out from
underneath their their cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're having wonderful harvests of food
throughout the whole season, along with
[SPEAKER_10]: their cannabis at the end of fall.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, they really helped start
the hugelkultur revolution that's
[SPEAKER_15]: happening and the whole water retention
through roots.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, they have a beautiful farm
and we really love Nick and Liz.
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you can add some to the chat on the
side and maybe we can move over quickly to
[SPEAKER_15]: Colorado and see what's happening with
Duke Diamond and the Dominion Seed Company
[SPEAKER_15]: and soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: How y'all dudes doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Duke.
Welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Haven't talked to you since like a forum
back in like 2005 or six or something,
[SPEAKER_09]: man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Glad to see you're doing good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Still trucking along.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all you can do.
[SPEAKER_15]: So tell us, Duke, a little bit about your
story and a little about the soils that
[SPEAKER_15]: you like to work on.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you work with and what really
brings the flavor to your herb?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because when we met up with you all down
in the Emerald Cup and smelled your herb,
[SPEAKER_15]: it was definitely some of the top most
flavorful ganja going on there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what are you using with soils to
create that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'd say like there's a few different
factors.
[SPEAKER_09]: So ideally, with the soil mix and
everything, the bud that y'all were
[SPEAKER_09]: smoking on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's been grown in the same soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been in the same pot about three
years now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's the way I like to mix my soil
that first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a couple of things that I changed
here, you know, when I when I moved down
[SPEAKER_09]: here because, you know, change in
technology, one, the lighting and two,
[SPEAKER_09]: I discovered like grow stones.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was real nice because it used to be I
would, you know, at least yearly,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have to bust open those root balls and
re-amend with para light with the grow
[SPEAKER_09]: stone stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't they don't break down like para
light.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was like a big help.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I haven't had to do any of that,
which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I layer it with a layer at the very bottom
of the pot that's about two to three
[SPEAKER_09]: inches like a good, good drainage layer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I keep things.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I lived in Oregon or like in the
Pacific Northwest, I would aerate a little
[SPEAKER_09]: bit more so than I do here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the the the the environment here in
Colorado, like, you know, it's very arid.
[SPEAKER_09]: So sometimes like where somebody say in
Oregon might be having to run
[SPEAKER_09]: dehumidifiers, I might actually have to
run a humidifier, you know, to to to keep
[SPEAKER_09]: things where I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are, you know, a few factors as
far as the soil mix and what's in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to be very diverse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people say, oh, well, you know,
I added a bunch of, you know, this in from
[SPEAKER_09]: a calcium supplement and that's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to add like a few different things,
different sources for the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Things break down at different speeds and
all.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm looking at like a more of a
quicker, instant gratification as well as
[SPEAKER_09]: long term soil health, you know,
something like oyster shell that would
[SPEAKER_09]: take a longer, longer period of time to
break down.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to keep everything kind of even
keeled, not too hot, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: but a good, good stout mix.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like to I like to have things more
in my control to where I'm I'm kind of in
[SPEAKER_09]: control on the boost and the peaks and
being able to kind of pull things away to,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, encourage them to to not flush
out at the end, but to to get a nice fade,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, where I don't have anything in
excess toward the end of a run to where
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually getting a fade.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they kind of finish out naturally.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing I would say would be,
you know, I use, you know, of course,
[SPEAKER_09]: your dragonfly product all throughout.
[SPEAKER_09]: About midway through, I take it,
I take it away and I'll give it like one
[SPEAKER_09]: more good boost.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to do like a earthworm casting tea.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like to do like a bat guano from a
fruit bat, you know, specifically.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always figured like if they're eating
fruit, you know, and they digest it and
[SPEAKER_09]: everything, then, you know, that kind of
translates to to a higher terpene content
[SPEAKER_09]: at the end as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also so something like we figured
out back in the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, originally I'm from
Virginia, so it wasn't as easy as like if
[SPEAKER_09]: you have a light bulb burn out or
something go wrong, you can't.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you could run to a hardware store,
but you're probably going to go to prison.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you couldn't just get a light bulb.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we had HPS go out and we just said,
screw it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We ended up running a metal halide the
whole time and noticed how much resin came
[SPEAKER_09]: out like we lost.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, flower density and all and like
a little bit of weight.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the amount of resin and the stink
really came out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we kind of came on to something back
then.
[SPEAKER_09]: But translating in the current day,
like we have these lights, I like to mix
[SPEAKER_09]: the spectrum up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the plants, they're they're like
our eyeballs, you know, you have rods and
[SPEAKER_09]: cones.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're very responsive to different
different spectrums of light.
[SPEAKER_09]: We find that, you know, the blues,
they bring out a lot more of the resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm finding that, you know,
you're getting a higher terpene content
[SPEAKER_09]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the last 21 days, I like to try to curb
it as much pure blue as possible and,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, moving into more of just a
straight water toward the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to I like to kind of think of the
microbes, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like workers at a industrial plant that
are building something, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I like to kind of be able to curb the
microbial dominance toward the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, like throughout their whole
growth cycle, depending on what I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: looking for them to do, I like to
encourage the microbes that are going to
[SPEAKER_09]: be encouraged and what we want to be done
and kind of keep the other ones more just
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of subtle on the back burner and
change the dominance of the microbes as
[SPEAKER_09]: the cycle progresses.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, by the by the end of it,
you know, we went from a bacterial
[SPEAKER_09]: dominance to a bacterial fungal kind of
even to more of a fungal dominance with a
[SPEAKER_09]: few bacterial boost.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe like the bacterials,
they it seems like if you supplement a
[SPEAKER_09]: little bit more of the bacterials at
certain points when you're feeding for
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes, because like I'm not just
growing flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think like I'm growing
biomass, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the end of the day, I'm trying to
grow resin glands.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to, you know, grow trichomes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm looking for terpene content.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm building, you know, biomass and
flour.
[SPEAKER_09]: But my focus is really on the glands.
[SPEAKER_09]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like my feeds are starting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, say like around in the 30s,
my feed start to drift away from building
[SPEAKER_09]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'm feeding specifically for
resin and terpene content.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm doing that like a lot of people
laugh when I tell them like what I water
[SPEAKER_09]: my plants with.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, it works.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm like taking like fruit juice and
stuff and breaking them down beforehand
[SPEAKER_09]: with certain microbes and all and
supplementing little bits of that into the
[SPEAKER_09]: feeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's also the way like I get a good
magnesium boost to help facilitate the
[SPEAKER_09]: phosphorus uptake in the middle toward the
end of the cycle is cranberries.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they're like they're very rich
in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I can sit there and break those down
beforehand when I feed it, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: to the to the pots, it's more more
instantly available, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: because like I like things to break down
on their own and the soil pot,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, feeding everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like I said, you know, I like to have
things in my control.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's that's that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that might actually let us get into
Scott.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would love to hear from Scott if we
all have a little patience so we can get
[SPEAKER_15]: through, you know, just listening to
everyone and then we can get into some
[SPEAKER_15]: question and answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And and create some dialogue between
everyone.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to have maybe Scott.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would love to hear from Scott some of
the information that you're getting from
[SPEAKER_15]: the living soil tests that you're doing at
different places, what you're seeing as
[SPEAKER_15]: some of the limitations or some of the
parameters where you feel like it may have
[SPEAKER_15]: gone too far.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd love to hear some more about the
tests of brewing and what you're finding
[SPEAKER_15]: with that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, I think, yeah, we we're going to
get Carolyn Mountain Girl on here soon and
[SPEAKER_15]: we're going to have to get to hear her
story.
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyway, thank you, Scott.
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on and let us know what you what
you're finding.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for having me on again for the
people that missed earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the main reasons I'm here is
because the inspiration of Dragonfly Earth
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so just intense thanks to you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I'm a I'm a really
concrete, obsessive data guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys helped me introduce the
concept to my brain that all the answers I
[SPEAKER_08]: need are already around me in nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and if I can just look at my
environment, the the environment is trying
[SPEAKER_08]: to communicate to communicate what that
environment is telling to me, which has
[SPEAKER_08]: been tremendous to fine tuning my
intuition, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_08]: So so thank you for you guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe you can pepper in some of your
work with Steve, too, because,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, I know you're working with Green
Life there, and that's a really important
[SPEAKER_15]: project, I think, for the whole industry,
really.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you can help us, you know,
you know, fill us in with that as you're
[SPEAKER_15]: telling us.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I do is I use a microscope to
count organisms.
[SPEAKER_08]: I learned that through aligning them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many years ago, you had to find somebody
that knew how to do this technique and
[SPEAKER_08]: convince them to allow you to learn it
from them through work trades and things
[SPEAKER_08]: like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So back in 2014, when I was learning to do
this, I had to convince other advisors to
[SPEAKER_08]: teach me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you can jump on Elaine's classes
and pay six hundred dollars and learn in a
[SPEAKER_08]: few months what took me a year and a half
to really sort out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the community is in for some
really exciting, exciting change here
[SPEAKER_08]: coming up as more people come online that
can do this type of mathematics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think one of the the things that the
living soul community is lacking is,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, a measurement device of living.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we say living soil, but by what
measure?
[SPEAKER_08]: Intentions are very, very important,
and intention definitely has an impact.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is biological life that you're
creating.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're essentially doing animal
husbandry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So and we're doing animal husbandry with
animals that we cannot see.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we need to create a hospital
environment where they can actually live
[SPEAKER_08]: and thrive.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think one of the biggest disconnects
is, you know, how the biological system
works.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I got a little visual aid here and
see if I can put that in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me put myself up here so I can see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a timeline that represents a
concept called ecological succession.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we start way over here on this
side, we've got, you know, either a major
[SPEAKER_08]: catastrophic flood or
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe vellips, we end up over here at Old
Grove Forest, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So climax forest.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this timeline measures the biological
activity that's going on in the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So above ground, we can very clearly see
the ecosystem transition from rocks to
[SPEAKER_08]: shrubs, row crops, bushes, trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we eventually end up at,
you know, the Redwood Forest.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can very clearly quantify these
numbers with a microscope and,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, 30 to 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mathematically, the most common numbers I
see, this is reverse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it reverse for me or you guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or am I just high?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's tripping.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably three or higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, yes, I'm high as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing backwards, backwards,
and backwards.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so the most common numbers
mathematically I see from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: soil samples are 0.09 to 0.12 fungi to
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is one of the numbers that we can
measure very clearly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you calculate the biomass of the fungi
and you calculate the biomass of the
[SPEAKER_08]: bacteria and that gives us a number,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So the most common living soil is way over
here, much closer to bare rock than it is
[SPEAKER_08]: to the ecosystem that cannabis would
naturally thrive in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so mathematically, according to
Elaine's work that she's done,
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis really wants to be in the equal
bacteria to equal biomass of fungi and
[SPEAKER_08]: bacteria, or all the way up to five times
the fungal biomass as bacterial biomass.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is a very important number
that we can quantify very clearly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just one of the numbers, but it's an
important number because it speaks to
[SPEAKER_08]: stability of the system.
[SPEAKER_08]: The bacteria and the fungi are the storage
systems in the soil that provide nutrients
[SPEAKER_08]: to our plants and then they have predators
and prey.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I first started doing this work,
the last thing I wanted to do was be a
[SPEAKER_08]: lab.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that seems to be where we're the most
useful.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: My wife is also trained to do the organism
numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we both do this type of math.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is kind of what we came up with to
help convey these really complex concepts.
[SPEAKER_08]: On this side, we have all the different
organism categories.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's, you know, fungi and bacteria,
which are storage systems, flagellates,
[SPEAKER_08]: amoebae, these other protozoa are the
opening device to the bags of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_08]: that are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then down here on the bottom,
we have the anaerobic indicators.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are the disease causing fungi.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the ciliates, which are
anaerobic predators of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are the values that are defined
by Elaine Ingham for the productive
[SPEAKER_08]: systems that cannabis would naturally
occur in.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, here we have a sample that
was a healthy yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't by any means concrete or the
highest values.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just an example of a good soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So blue boxes indicate that we are
exceeding these minimum values and green
[SPEAKER_08]: means that we're within range.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we need a certain population of
bacteria and fungi to even be considered a
[SPEAKER_08]: living ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then how quickly those organisms
convert into nutrients is based on what's
[SPEAKER_08]: eating it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the conditions are oxygen rich or
oxygen deprived determines who is
[SPEAKER_08]: consuming the fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are three other samples that I've
done.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one says spider mites and mold and
russet mites.
[SPEAKER_08]: So red boxes indicate significantly low,
much, much lower or approaching
[SPEAKER_08]: catastrophic situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And orange is slightly under.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see that as we get to the worst
pest, we get more and more red boxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's significant about russet mites,
for example, are the extremely high values
[SPEAKER_08]: for disease causing fungi, which this is a
number that should be more appropriate to
[SPEAKER_08]: like the beneficial fungi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if we look at the good example,
we got 345 fungi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Way down here at russet mites and mold,
we have 300 disease causing fungi.
[SPEAKER_08]: So from my perspective, it's completely
flipped upside down as to what the makeup
[SPEAKER_08]: of a healthy soil should be.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if we translate that to russet
mites, the most common question I get is
[SPEAKER_08]: how do you kill russet mites?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not into killing things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm into creating living soil systems.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can tell you that in all five of
these russet mite examples, we have a
[SPEAKER_08]: tremendous amount of red boxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: These first three samples are from a farm
that had high elevation.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were brewing compost tea for three
days with a tremendous amount of food
[SPEAKER_08]: input.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was turning it horrendous.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you can see way down here,
this ciliate right here, this is the
[SPEAKER_08]: anaerobic predator of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have numbers that are more
appropriate to the aerobic organisms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And way down here, we have fungi numbers
of the disease causing omicids.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are water molds, which are
responsible for PM, are in the population
[SPEAKER_08]: values that are more appropriate for the
ideal numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you look way up here, if bacteria
are the fertilizer, bags in the soil,
[SPEAKER_08]: and the fungi are the fertilizer bags in
the soil, we're significantly less than
[SPEAKER_08]: 300.
[SPEAKER_08]: We only have 80.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is extremely dysfunctional nutrient
storage from a mathematical perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if you go to these two samples,
this came from a different farm that had
[SPEAKER_08]: two different locations on the property.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this example, the russet mites
completely overtook the garden,
[SPEAKER_08]: and we had crop loss.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this situation, they were able to
battle the russet mite back and actually
[SPEAKER_08]: pull off a harvest.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you look down here at the anaerobic
fungi and the anaerobic predators of
[SPEAKER_08]: bacteria, we have obscenely high numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's certain ratios that problems seem
to pop up.
[SPEAKER_08]: The omicids, for example, when this
disease causing fungi number gets to or
[SPEAKER_08]: exceeds 25% of the good fungi,
we start to have mold and disease pressure
[SPEAKER_08]: pop up like clockwork.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so these are numbers that are known,
not known by many people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to do my best to be a
communicator for the industry and the
[SPEAKER_08]: community about what these numbers mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the biggest obstacle right now is
people are failing to understand that this
[SPEAKER_08]: living soil is extremely dynamic.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're brewing a compost tea,
you are creating life in a tank.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the temperature, the water
temperature, your elevation, all these
[SPEAKER_08]: things compound tremendously into the end
result.
[SPEAKER_08]: And working at the commercial scale,
we've removed teas, and that really blows
[SPEAKER_08]: people's minds.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what we found is the compost tea is
far too dynamic for the commercial
[SPEAKER_08]: setting, and it only antagonizes because
you're growing populations of organisms
[SPEAKER_08]: that might not have anything to do with
what's going on in the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people are actually perpetuating
disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you go back to the Russet mite
example, here's five samples from Russet
[SPEAKER_08]: mite gardens where they're all doing what
they would consider a fungally dominated
[SPEAKER_08]: compost tea, whatever that means.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is fungally dominated.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dominated with disease causing fungi
that's leading to Russet mite pest
[SPEAKER_08]: pressure, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at the commercial scale,
the biggest obstacle is honestly a mindset
[SPEAKER_08]: change and trying to comprehend where
these organisms are and how these
[SPEAKER_08]: organisms are being distributed.
[SPEAKER_08]: The most common thing we see, whether it's
a four by four tent or it's a 35,000
[SPEAKER_08]: square foot facility like GLP,
how are these organisms being spread
[SPEAKER_08]: across the property because they're not
being spread across evenly?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like the hot air in the greenhouse
will separate or stratify, and the hot air
[SPEAKER_08]: stays at the top, and then there's a
defined layer, and the cold air comes
[SPEAKER_08]: below.
[SPEAKER_08]: Organisms stratify in a compost tea tank.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so nematodes have a density greater
than water, so they sink immediately.
[SPEAKER_08]: And our most common, our most favorite
thing to do is distribute nematodes
[SPEAKER_08]: unevenly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here is, this is designed to be an
overhead view of four groups of plants in
[SPEAKER_08]: any size greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so here's our reservoir.
[SPEAKER_08]: And every Monday morning, employee goes to
the whiteboard and they see gnat pressure
[SPEAKER_08]: in all bays do nematodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they go to the refrigerator and they
get nematodes and they put them into the
[SPEAKER_08]: reservoir because that's what we like to
do, put everything in the res.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the nematodes sink to the bottom
immediately because they have a density
[SPEAKER_08]: greater than water.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then our reservoir, our employee
stretches out the hose to the longest
[SPEAKER_08]: distance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the employee stretches out the hose
all the way and comes up way here and
[SPEAKER_08]: starts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the nematodes are at the bottom of the
tank, and the hose is being drawn from the
[SPEAKER_08]: bottom of the tank.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all the nematodes end up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they slowly make their way
around.
[SPEAKER_08]: And since the hose is all the way
stretched out, well, why don't we take it
[SPEAKER_08]: to the other side?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the hardest whiteboarding I've
ever done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so then we stretch it out to this
side.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they either go to here or they go
to here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever they do, they do it the same
every Monday and they do it same for every
[SPEAKER_08]: bay in the building.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the patterns start to develop the
same.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we were to count nematodes,
so if we were to count nematodes on a
[SPEAKER_08]: cover slip, but anybody can do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we look at where they started first,
there might be 12 nematodes per slide up
[SPEAKER_08]: in this base.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got tremendous protection of this
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_08]: With predator nematodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we come over here and five and
four would be adequate for the commercial.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have a situation where this group
of plants didn't get any because they all
[SPEAKER_08]: got distributed across the other
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we move into Bay 2 and we repeat
this formula.
[SPEAKER_08]: We move into Bay 3 and we report this
process.
[SPEAKER_08]: We move into Bay 4 and we repeat this
process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have, by a percentage of square
footage, we have 25% of our bay with zero
[SPEAKER_08]: protection of predatory nematodes doing
anything to protect you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this example that I'm speaking of
was four or 5,000 square foot bays.
[SPEAKER_08]: So 25% of all bays has zero protection
from larvae of pests through the form of
[SPEAKER_08]: predator nematodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just the simple act of changing the
way in which we distribute these
[SPEAKER_08]: nematodes, instead of putting them into a
thousand gallon reservoir, put them into
[SPEAKER_08]: an eight ounce scientific wash bottle,
a little squirt bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: There can be hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_08]: nematodes in a single drop from an
eyedropper.
[SPEAKER_08]: We send people nematodes in a vial and
just have them go around with a dropper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because really all you needed is to
distribute them evenly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to come in and saying
that it seems as if that if we add
[SPEAKER_10]: nutrients to the soil, then we just allow
the soil to do our brewing, rather than
[SPEAKER_10]: creating a separate brewer of different
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe what is your take on brewing
nutrients rather than brewing
[SPEAKER_10]: microbiology?
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're allowing the soil to do the
microbiology, what about giving the
[SPEAKER_10]: microbiology and the soil nutrients
through some type of brewing?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or maybe a steeping of materials?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so there's compost tea, which you
put compost into a water tank and you
[SPEAKER_08]: aerate it for a specified amount of time
and you add food inputs.
[SPEAKER_08]: We would call that a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another technique called a compost
extract, which is simply just dislodging
[SPEAKER_08]: organisms from the surface of the compost
into the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: The caveat to that concept is you need
compost with actual organisms to dislodge
[SPEAKER_08]: into the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the most difficult aspect.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really difficult to get organisms to
survive the process that is composting
[SPEAKER_08]: yard to a bag to your property.
[SPEAKER_08]: Malibu's was the first brand that I saw
real fungi in that I could buy from the
[SPEAKER_08]: store.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was really exciting way back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're able to get actual beneficial
fungi all the way through the process was
[SPEAKER_08]: extremely important.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we actually make thermal compost to
the style of Alain's to get certain
[SPEAKER_08]: populations and ratio of what organisms
produce.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you have compost that has adequate
populations to do this technique,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can just very low tech dislodge them
into the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: The benefit to that is you're dislodging
the organisms into the water and then the
[SPEAKER_08]: organisms will penetrate as deep as the
water does.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we brew a compost tea and we apply it
to the soil surface, these organisms are
[SPEAKER_08]: producing blues and they attach to the
organic matter at the very top surface and
[SPEAKER_08]: they never come into contact with the
roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: What ends up happening with an extract is
you get the organisms from the compost,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is the transport mechanism to your
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: You dislodge them into water and without
exciting them with aeration or foods,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can get them to penetrate the entire
soil profile, come into contact with the
[SPEAKER_08]: roots, and then the plant starts to take
over and do the brewing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest obstacle with tea brewing is
how do the conditions in your tea brewer
[SPEAKER_08]: have anything to do with the conditions in
your soil and your growing life in a tank
[SPEAKER_08]: that has a certain temperature,
a certain set of conditions, and then you
[SPEAKER_08]: move it into a soil that has significantly
different conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the biggest downsides to tea
brewing is you're selecting for organisms
[SPEAKER_08]: that enjoy or can at least tolerate a
water environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mathematically, you end up with a lot of
water molds by definition, which are these
[SPEAKER_08]: omicids.
[SPEAKER_08]: The repetitive fungal dominant brewing
techniques perpetuates these omicids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Omicids perpetuates the water molds.
[SPEAKER_08]: They get lined in all the tubes and hoses.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've come to the same concept
that you guys have.
[SPEAKER_08]: You mentioned at the Emerald Cup that
you've stopped the thermal composting.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just put the material into the beds and
we let nature handle the composting.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're turning our beds into the compost
pile.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we've been doing that for years
and it seems to be working out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeff, we wanted to go on to you.
[SPEAKER_15]: We appreciate your information,
Scott.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Scott, everything that you're doing is
really bringing so much light and another
[SPEAKER_10]: side to the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really creating a holistic picture
with a W.
[SPEAKER_10]: We really appreciate everything that
you're doing for the whole community.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your work is invaluable.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be doing a workshop on
January 26th to 29th up in Portland,
[SPEAKER_08]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: The website is regenerativeorganiccannabis
.com, or you can check into Dutch Blooms
[SPEAKER_08]: on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about this for several
hours and get deep into the nitty-gritty
[SPEAKER_08]: of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too much to really cram into 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to actually thank Dutch Blooms as
well because he was the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_05]: inspiration of putting a panel together
like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up contacting Dragonfly Earth
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were the ones that put it together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior to that, I was talking to Dutch
Blooms based on the panel or the
[SPEAKER_05]: conference that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw it and I was like, I'd love to do a
show on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be really great.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of us are going to be at that show.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of us that are here on this panel
are going to be at that show.
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be a chance to continue to go
deeper.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeff, I wanted to bring you into the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about scientific studies
that Scotto is having.
[SPEAKER_10]: How is this specific to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about bringing up our fungi
rates.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is equal to our bacterial rates.
[SPEAKER_10]: How can we do that in our soil in a way
that is good for cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, I want to say that I think
what Scott has done is important for the
[SPEAKER_12]: listener to distinguish.
[SPEAKER_12]: The things that a lot of the individual
growers will do in their homes don't scale
[SPEAKER_12]: up to a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess you've got to decide maybe not
just a commercial grow, but to a large
[SPEAKER_12]: grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: People, as the laws change and you're
coming out of the closet where you're
[SPEAKER_12]: growing one plant and all of a sudden
you've got a big greenhouse, you've got to
[SPEAKER_12]: start thinking quite a lot differently.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Scott's really demonstrated that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Compost tea in my little greenhouse with
one or two plants works great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Would I advise my local growers got a
25,000 square foot greenhouse to do
[SPEAKER_12]: compost tea?
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's all fascinating stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the more information we get,
the more we're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_12]: determine what our plants need when they
need it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be acting less with intuition and a
lot more with regard to science.
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I think Scott really ought to be
congratulated.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this thing that's going to happen
the 26th, 27th, 28th is going to be
[SPEAKER_12]: fascinating.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope it's going to be taped so it's
going to be available to people because I
[SPEAKER_12]: think the panels look pretty darn good or
the speakers look pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, your question basically is how is
this science beginning to impact?
[SPEAKER_12]: How is it changing?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not quite sure I get exactly what your
question is.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, how we can add to our soils,
what it's going to take to create those
[SPEAKER_15]: numbers or if you have any ideas on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, again, it depends on whether
the listener is a small home grower or a
[SPEAKER_12]: big commercial grower, but obviously we
want to be as regenerative as possible and
[SPEAKER_12]: we want to comply with what I consider to
be the key rule and that's the rule of
[SPEAKER_12]: return or the law of return, which is one
of the key laws of nutrient feeding of
[SPEAKER_12]: plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: What falls down from a plant generally is
enough to feed that plant and so when the
[SPEAKER_12]: redwoods grow, they never need to be
fertilized because they're feeding
[SPEAKER_12]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're returning to the soil through the
loss of the needles and bark and dead
[SPEAKER_12]: trees and everything else, all the good
nutrients that they've taken out of the
[SPEAKER_12]: soil and so in theory there's a balance.
[SPEAKER_12]: We come along as cannabis growers and of
course we violate that law of return.
[SPEAKER_12]: We break the law of return and so we've
got to be able to put back into the soils
[SPEAKER_12]: the kinds of stuff that are going to take
the place of what we're taking out of the
[SPEAKER_12]: soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm always interested when I hear somebody
and I think Scott, maybe you were one of
[SPEAKER_12]: the ones who said that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was you.
[SPEAKER_12]: People who reuse their soil in their
cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_12]: So many people just throw their soil out,
which to me just tells me that they don't
[SPEAKER_12]: understand their soil and they don't
understand testing this oil and they don't
[SPEAKER_12]: understand adding and building the soil
and creating a living organism which they
[SPEAKER_12]: don't need to fill out, but which thrives
and which they can add to and which gets
[SPEAKER_12]: better even as you grow more and more
stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So in order to get the kind of soil that I
would want to get, you've got to have two
[SPEAKER_12]: things.
[SPEAKER_12]: One is access to testing obviously and I
would do a soil food web test,
[SPEAKER_12]: but again I don't know Scott, are you
doing your own testing now?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is your test commercial?
[SPEAKER_08]: Crest the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh sorry, yeah we just do kind of the
opposite of advertising and marketing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've really tried to be way below the
radar and be quiet about what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of noise out there so I
didn't want to contribute to the noise.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to contribute with results.
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing I'd like to add is when we start
talking about scaling, we start talking,
[SPEAKER_15]: are we scaling indoors?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we scaling in a field or are we
scaling in a garden?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we scaling in a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_15]: And really it is kind of a different setup
when you have the dynamics of earth or you
[SPEAKER_15]: have the dynamics of greenhouse which is
sort of like an enclosed setting and then
[SPEAKER_15]: you have the dynamics of indoors and we're
looking at indoor soil building as what
[SPEAKER_15]: about adding a little bit of hay or little
bits of carbon or even little bits of
[SPEAKER_15]: sawdust in small ratios to be able to
sustain that carbon life over the turn and
[SPEAKER_15]: that's almost like bringing the wood and
outdoors there's so much more use of wood
[SPEAKER_15]: and so much more use of wood chips to
bring in that kind of fungal dominance
[SPEAKER_15]: into our soil in order to retain the
organisms once they grow and also to
[SPEAKER_15]: create the life because like Scott was
saying, we bring in compost tea and we add
[SPEAKER_15]: it to the soil.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well if there's not enough biomass or
carbon or organic matter in the soil then
[SPEAKER_15]: there's nothing for it to grow on and it
can't stay living.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think another thing that I wanted to
add of what Josh was saying is just
[SPEAKER_10]: looking at on a more human level because I
always seem to bring it back to that is
[SPEAKER_10]: that people like us who have these really
long 12-year beds that go on and on,
[SPEAKER_10]: I call that a gut of steel.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the same way that we call a gut of
steel of someone who has really good
[SPEAKER_10]: microbiology in their belly, there's a lot
more things that you can throw at
[SPEAKER_10]: long-term soils because they have the
natural defenses to be able to create a
[SPEAKER_10]: good soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a memory of a good soil and when
we're talking about indoor soils we're
[SPEAKER_10]: talking about a really sensitive gut,
a gut that you know is more difficult and
[SPEAKER_10]: things that you throw at it we have to be
very careful.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just think that that's an important
part of what we're talking about as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well I think it is but I think again soil
is soil and if you're going to make good,
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean the microbes, the microbes that you
want to grow are the microbes that the
[SPEAKER_12]: plant needs and they don't, you know
whether you're indoors or outdoors they're
[SPEAKER_12]: pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's maybe just more of a
question of how you do it and your
[SPEAKER_12]: cleanliness and again thinking it through
so that you don't put your nematodes on
[SPEAKER_12]: one end of the field, you know,
forget that you've got the other ends not
[SPEAKER_12]: getting any nematodes, but I always mulch
my plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm always surprised when I walk into a
grow and I find plants indoor or outdoor
[SPEAKER_12]: that aren't mulched.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think it's incredibly important
again because we're designing a system
[SPEAKER_12]: where we know we're gonna break the law of
return.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to add in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Adding compost tea alone is not enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're using a big gigantic grow it's
not advisable, I don't think and so
[SPEAKER_12]: mulches tend to be a terrific addition.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I add a compost layer when I add my
grows and I think that's always very
[SPEAKER_12]: important as well and a cover crop I think
is the third thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: All of these things, you know,
the cover crop in particular because the
[SPEAKER_12]: cover crop you don't break the law of
return.
[SPEAKER_12]: It does go back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is refeeding and regenerating and
adding that carbon and the nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_12]: right ratio.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, I mean bare soil is the big bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's start right there.
[SPEAKER_15]: It really is and the cover cropping a lot
of people I think let it sit too long and
[SPEAKER_15]: they let it kind of grip into the soil and
then it can become antagonistic.
[SPEAKER_15]: It can become part of the pathogen too and
I really feel you need to keep the cover
[SPEAKER_15]: crop green and full of life and utilize
its green manure aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, that's a way to keep it
healthy in there and you don't want to
[SPEAKER_15]: have anything stagnating in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want the peas growing up your
plants?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, maybe there's a food
forest setting where that makes sense
[SPEAKER_15]: outdoors, but I definitely don't think you
want that happening indoors.
[SPEAKER_15]: I see that Jesse's in here from the
regenerative cannabis farm award and bio
[SPEAKER_15]: vortex and he does a lot of beautiful
things for the industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to recognize you, appreciate you
for a second.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just thinking maybe really quickly
we would just go to Steve and just because
[SPEAKER_15]: we were just talking about with Scott and
stuff then we would just finish off that
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of what a little bit about his
journey with his indoor soils and then I
[SPEAKER_15]: think we can explore our outdoor soils and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Does that sound good, Jesse?
[SPEAKER_15]: You can say hi and everything to everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent, thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: We love and appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey Steve, can you tell us a little bit
about some of your original soils?
[SPEAKER_15]: How you started?
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe a little bit about your lighting and
what you're doing currently.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so, you know, I got into no till
probably plus about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got our first commercial grow out in
the prompt Nevada going about three years
[SPEAKER_07]: ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've we've learned so much
everything you could possibly do wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've done at some point and we've learned
to value it because that's all you can do
[SPEAKER_07]: is just kind of learn from your lessons.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the things Scott was talking
about we've learned firsthand as far as
[SPEAKER_07]: equal distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: Flat bottom tea brewers, just cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_07]: The industry in general that a lot of
people complain about regulations we've
[SPEAKER_07]: actually used to our benefit to help us,
you know, become better growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: In our original facility in prompt we have
three rooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're on a 10 cycle now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the benefit of being indoors is in
three years we pulled off 10 cycles and it
[SPEAKER_07]: would times three that's 30 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Worth of of a data that we've been able to
take and actually and play with and
[SPEAKER_07]: actually analyze.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in a large scale, no less.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not like we're talking,
you know, 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking.
[SPEAKER_07]: 500 plants a room and we turn them every
single month.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things that we've learned
over time is just basically simplifying it
[SPEAKER_07]: and not trying to over complicate things
is really key.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't try to reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_07]: God, Mother Nature, whatever you want to
call it, has already done it, has already
[SPEAKER_07]: learned it, has already taught us it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All you got to basically do is just kind
of learn from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The arrogance of man is kind of try to do
everything better, do everything faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a time for every purpose.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you basically follow that kind of that
methodology and basically plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, I don't believe anybody's properly
cultivating soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know the the ways and shortcuts to
cultivate this plant to make it profitable
[SPEAKER_07]: to our needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: But none of us actually take the time to
cultivate the soil to do the job it needs
[SPEAKER_07]: to be able to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody is constantly inoculating,
inoculating.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I believe inoculants are like
the new bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a new MPK.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the day, if you're working with the
living soil, you shouldn't need so many
[SPEAKER_07]: inoculants.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be able to inoculate a lot,
a lot less and actually be able to let the
[SPEAKER_07]: soil do its job and do its full cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways, I'm getting a little bit off
track.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the most part, we've learned a
lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: We started off with the basic no-till mix
that so many people are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of heavy neem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we ran into problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: We ran into things as far as contaminated
inputs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So testing not only your soil,
not only your plants, not only doing
[SPEAKER_07]: biology tests, but your MPK tests,
but also testing your inputs.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you bring in a dirty input full
of E.
[SPEAKER_07]: coli.
[SPEAKER_07]: You spread that across your garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even when you're not, you're going to have
issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think knowing what inputs to
introduce, what inputs you should probably
[SPEAKER_07]: just better stay away from is going to be
key.
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, again, just simplifying it so
everybody can do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't try to recreate the wheel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't try to go above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_07]: We move away from teasing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tease in general, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to do the extracts, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But our first facility, again,
we started off with a basic mix,
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of neem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our new facility, we just took over a
$35,000 square facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a hydroponic facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: They ran a current culture hydroponic
systems, double-ended bulbs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a real race car of a facility,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_07]: We moved in and gutted the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we brought in living soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it kind of, in the investors' eyes,
went backwards.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had this trick race car, and we
brought in a bunch of dirt.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've been extremely successful,
far more successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're working through it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to, as we show them,
they kind of got to earn our keep a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't just walk in and stomp our
feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're kind of showing them what we're
worth and what we can do and how to do it
[SPEAKER_07]: right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Slowly but surely, we're making changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our new soil recipe, we completely removed
away from neem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's actually 300 yards, zero neem.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did use peat.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of starting to try to move away from
that and try to find better, more
[SPEAKER_07]: renewable sources to kind of fill that
void.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we got to the hydro system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're using living soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: We created a new type of bed that we
believe is better for living soil,
[SPEAKER_07]: that we're seeing promising results from.
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of solves all the issues that we
were having on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the most part, our challenge is
trying to, again, make it a more,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's kind of hard to say.
[SPEAKER_15]: What does your new bed look like compared
to the other one?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we learned in our old facility at GLP,
really in the last year, as we've been
[SPEAKER_07]: working more soil food web and less,
more feeding the soil, versus bypassing
[SPEAKER_07]: and feeding the plant, as our mulch layers
really come to life, what we've learned is
[SPEAKER_07]: that our mulch layer will hold more
moisture than the fabric beds,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially if they're sitting on like a
grade or like a bottom that will allow air
[SPEAKER_07]: to get to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what happens is, is your soil
will actually dry from the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of, it creates a whole
number of problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: In our situation, it was creating a
bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually drew a really...
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds like, yeah, your sound just cut out
for some reason, Steve.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure why.
[SPEAKER_15]: His microphone looks muted.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, something happened to your
microphone.
[SPEAKER_07]: There he goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we good there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a whiteboard like Scott,
but I did draw a little demonstration of
[SPEAKER_07]: our problem, because I knew I was going to
be asked this question at some point.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here you have your basic bed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what would happen is, is if you could
see, we would have air that would come
[SPEAKER_07]: from the bottom and the sides,
and it would create a bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would limit our soil volume and our
actual biology, our soil food web,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would lower our root space,
the ability for our roots to actually
[SPEAKER_07]: chase water, the volume our roots can
actually fill.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what happened was, is we would
actually try to push down this bubble,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we would just try to push down it by
watering it too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then we would overwater, and then we
would go anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then this whole mulch layer,
it would turn anaerobic, trying to push
[SPEAKER_07]: down this bubble right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then on our new beds, what we did,
or actually on our old beds, we wrapped
[SPEAKER_07]: them with basically a plastic to try to
slow down the evaporation from the sides.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the new beds, we actually had grass
roots build in, actually a moisture
[SPEAKER_07]: barrier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three quarters of the bed actually has a
moisture barrier versus the fabric.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what that does is it allows us to
create more of like a water basin effect,
[SPEAKER_07]: like a lot of outdoor people are trying to
sink water and store water in their
[SPEAKER_07]: ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to use that same concept
indoors on an obviously much smaller
[SPEAKER_07]: scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we're not trying to reinvent the
wheel.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just trying to make it smaller and
spin it faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're doing here is we're creating
more of a water basin effect, where we're
[SPEAKER_07]: actually able to sink the water more
naturally and allow the roots to chase
[SPEAKER_07]: that water.
[SPEAKER_07]: We still allow fabric in the top to allow
air in the top, because that's where the
[SPEAKER_07]: biological activities end up being the
mulch layer and the surface roots and the
[SPEAKER_07]: vertical roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it still allows air pruning in the
vertical roots in the top.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, the fabric bottom allows
drainage as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have drainage without waste.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're still draining.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a higher level of rock at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're still draining to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're using that capillary action
to actually equally distribute that water
[SPEAKER_07]: more evenly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also use Blumont watering carrots.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the way these work is they'll fire on,
they'll sink that water until they shut
[SPEAKER_07]: off, and then capillary action will allow
it to raise it and spread it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think intuitively that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_15]: It really is kind of mimicking what's
happening outdoors.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're putting more rocks in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_15]: What roots love to wrap around rocks.
[SPEAKER_15]: You could even get river rock if you
wanted to and mix it with pumice.
[SPEAKER_15]: You could use some ganja stocks or some
kind of sticks, some finer sticks,
[SPEAKER_15]: and you could layer that through the
bottom of your beds too, I think
[SPEAKER_15]: originally when you started.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that might give you an
aeration in the bottom and also keep the
[SPEAKER_15]: water towards the bottom.
[SPEAKER_15]: That sounds really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: I really appreciate those diagrams.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really, really excellent.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think you really need a
whiteboard.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wondering if we can hear from Athene
and then maybe we can, or not Athene,
[SPEAKER_15]: but Jessie, but maybe it is Athene.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then maybe it'd be nice to talk about
what Appalachian is.
[SPEAKER_15]: And terroir and maybe hear from Colm and
more.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Swami can tell us about what he's
learned about terroir and Appalachian and
[SPEAKER_15]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: But Jessie, please tell us the cannabis
and what's happening outdoors and what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're seeing in a revolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first off, I just want to say I
really enjoyed hearing the last couple
[SPEAKER_06]: bits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jeff is very much right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to start with thinking about
keeping soil covered.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the enemy is uncovered soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the mulching, the cover cropping,
these are the most important things to be
[SPEAKER_06]: doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess, yeah, the question is about
regenerative cannabis and what's going on
[SPEAKER_06]: with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we created this award called the
Regenerative Cannabis Farm Award a couple
[SPEAKER_06]: of years ago to kind of really push
forward these permaculture ideas and have
[SPEAKER_06]: them become a little bit more mainplace
and have them be something that people are
[SPEAKER_06]: competing for.
[SPEAKER_06]: But instead of it just being about the
best products and flowers, but really
[SPEAKER_06]: about practices and care for the earth and
soil building.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have found that that's actually
giving the best flowers to that connection
[SPEAKER_06]: with nature, that connection with living
soil is going to give you just really
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful flowers that resonate with the
kind of psychoactive effects that you want
[SPEAKER_06]: to as well as being the best in terpene
production.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been really amazing to see all
these community members all over really
[SPEAKER_06]: start working towards soil building as
the, I guess, the flagship of operations
[SPEAKER_06]: of thinking about living soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're seeing all these hugo cultures
being built everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're seeing higher levels of terpenes
and better quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're also seeing better care for the
watersheds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're seeing like we're building these
biological filters when we're building
[SPEAKER_06]: really fungal rich mycelium like based
growing mediums using like hugo culture
[SPEAKER_06]: type techniques and the mulching.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are like, you know, you're
purifying the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're playing a positive role in building
biodiversity in your system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then beyond that, you're also like
you're building poly culture with with
[SPEAKER_06]: hugo culture style growing permaculture
style growing, you're growing lots of
[SPEAKER_06]: other plants with it food plants,
but also just native plants and stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: that's good for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you just really build that
biodiversity, you're inviting health in
[SPEAKER_06]: your area.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're bringing lots of pollinators
in, you're bringing all of the creatures
[SPEAKER_06]: that are going to keep everything in
balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like when you have pests, and if you
have 100 things that eat them,
[SPEAKER_06]: then, you know, pests don't become the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They might not even really be pests.
[SPEAKER_06]: They might just be telling you other
things that are unbalanced.
[SPEAKER_06]: They might be things that are
communicating to you that are helping
[SPEAKER_06]: actually the plant evolve and helping your
system evolve because really where you see
[SPEAKER_06]: pests is with monoculture and with
chemical nutrients and with exposed soil
[SPEAKER_06]: and disturbance.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's when we throw something off balance,
that's when pests come over to try to put
[SPEAKER_06]: it back into balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that initial part of it's not very
pleasant, you know, to have the bugs that
[SPEAKER_06]: are eating what you're trying to grow and
the thorns grow back and the, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the more, you know, like poison oak and
thorny plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like those are the first things that you
see with disturbance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they're helping to kind of
rebuild a biology and keep us at bay a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we created a website just recently
called the Regenerative Cannabis Farming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's regenerativecannabisfarming.org
with Dan Mar of Hightype Permaculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: We started creating a free resource for
people to come and see different farms
[SPEAKER_06]: that are utilizing more permaculture-based
and regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we feature the farms that we gave,
we honored at the Emerald Cup for the
[SPEAKER_06]: Regenerative Cannabis Farm Award.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to actually continue that
on with the Cultivation Classic this year,
[SPEAKER_06]: May 12th, up in Portland.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's an amazing event where we
really dive into the science of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: the cultivores, we're talking about the
genes, we're talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: phylose is a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We map the winners and talk about what
that means, the information, how we can
[SPEAKER_06]: interpret that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really dive into the chemotypes and
make that information available for
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also give all that information to a
project called the Open Cannabis Project,
[SPEAKER_06]: with phylose also donates all their
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: More and more labs are starting to donate
their information.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what the Open Cannabis Project is a
nonprofit organization that's designed to,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're basically building a database of as
much chemotype and genetic information
[SPEAKER_06]: that we can to help fight against
potential harmful broad-spectrum plant
[SPEAKER_06]: patents, the utility patents that can be
way too wide-stroked and actually hinder
[SPEAKER_06]: innovation and medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we want to do is show that these
things are already prior art and that they
[SPEAKER_06]: should be free for everyone to play with.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time, having some very narrow
patents to help promote innovation isn't
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily the worst thing, but we saw
what happened with the patent trolls with
[SPEAKER_06]: software in the early days of computers
and stuff that was open source,
[SPEAKER_06]: all of a sudden patent trolls were like,
oh, nobody has a patent on this,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make a patent on this and then I'll
sue a whole bunch of people for something
[SPEAKER_06]: that I didn't invent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want to prevent that stuff from
happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want cannabis to be clean and open.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really great.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're here in Vancouver, British Columbia,
right at the moment.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've luckily been hanging out with
Marcus and we're at the Lyft Cannabis Expo
[SPEAKER_15]: and Jeremy Plum is here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mowgli.
[SPEAKER_15]: Part of the Open Cannabis Project and
Mowgli was here and he was talking with
[SPEAKER_15]: Jonathan Page.
[SPEAKER_10]: As well as Ryan.
[SPEAKER_15]: The living soil and the regenerative
movement and the consciousness and the
[SPEAKER_15]: movement towards craft cannabis is
spreading through Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's spreading through the rest of the
world.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone's paying attention.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of talk about regulations
and how it's going to affect us.
[SPEAKER_15]: We think that this conversation is really
valuable because we have people from
[SPEAKER_15]: different parts of the country,
different parts of the world, indoor and
[SPEAKER_15]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is the way that we're going to be
able to survive with big agriculture
[SPEAKER_15]: coming.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have a non-deal labs here in BC and
we have phylos in Portland doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: that work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we're finding is through the
testing, we're testing terpenes and we're
[SPEAKER_10]: testing cannabinoids and we're testing
mineral levels.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're testing soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're also still realizing that you
can have the same particular cultivar,
[SPEAKER_10]: even the same clone in the same soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can have two different growers
that are actually growing this particular
[SPEAKER_10]: plant in the same soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're going to come up with different
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to come up with different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that we're utilizing this term
as the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Meaning that cannabis is a sentient being.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gathering information not only from
the soil, but also from us because we have
[SPEAKER_10]: brought it forward into humanity through
humans and cannabis have always been
[SPEAKER_10]: brought together.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like this might be a perfect
time to talk about terroir and Appalachia
[SPEAKER_10]: and areas of cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, Swami, you know a lot about
terroir and your particular area.
[SPEAKER_15]: And how it can relate to craft cannabis in
the face of like say the big agriculture.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once big agriculture takes over,
how is Appalachian and terroir and bio
[SPEAKER_15]: regions going to help us?
[SPEAKER_15]: Swami, I don't know if you mind telling us
a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you all.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is absolutely thrilling.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in awe of all you folks, how much you
know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jeff Lohanfels, you just opened my mind
about how above and below as above so
[SPEAKER_14]: below relates to soil.
[SPEAKER_14]: Scott, your statistics and so on are mind
boggling.
[SPEAKER_14]: Teas, compost, ah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the thing I want to say also is this
is also new and cutting edge because it's
[SPEAKER_14]: the most ancient way that human beings
have actually grown.
[SPEAKER_14]: Living soil is not a new thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an ancient field.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the terroir issue, if you really want a
little more detailed stuff, you can check
[SPEAKER_14]: the blog I just posted on swamiselect.com
and then you can get some more.
[SPEAKER_14]: But terroir is essentially the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the entire living context in which
something occurs.
[SPEAKER_14]: And every organism on the planet seems to
have been derived from the initial terroir
[SPEAKER_14]: in which it presented itself.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's an expression of that terroir.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, literally, of course,
it means the earth itself, but culturally,
[SPEAKER_14]: it means that the ethnobotanical
interaction of a species with its
[SPEAKER_14]: surrounding and with the human beings who
are interacting with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, we know we've been
interacting with this for over 10,000
[SPEAKER_14]: years.
[SPEAKER_14]: The idea that it's all alive and that as
above so below emphasizes the spiritual
[SPEAKER_14]: aspect of cannabis and how it comes out in
the way we want it.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's another aspect of this which I've
just been learning about is called
[SPEAKER_14]: epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: And epigenetics is what happens after the
genes have manifested into reality.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the input that we put through love
and attention and care that makes,
[SPEAKER_14]: as you just said, Kelly, that the same
seed and the same genetics grown in a
[SPEAKER_14]: different place is an expression of the
people.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the symbiotic relationship we
have with this plant, which is more
[SPEAKER_14]: extreme than anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the idea of an Appalachian and a
terroir, you probably know the Appalachian
[SPEAKER_14]: comes from gemapel, it is called,
or I am called.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that means what is the name of the
place where it's originating and what is
[SPEAKER_14]: specific and unique about that place?
[SPEAKER_14]: And can it be tasted and sampled and
detected in the final product?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's like Bordeaux wine,
you know, actually tastes and looks and
[SPEAKER_14]: smells different from burgundy wine and so
on.
[SPEAKER_14]: To establish the actual scientific basis
of why a particular area region section,
[SPEAKER_14]: a terroir is unique.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're in the process through the
Mendocino Appalachian Project and through
[SPEAKER_14]: the state of California to create these
zones and identify the actual biological
[SPEAKER_14]: meteorological soil, all that stuff,
which is unique about an area.
[SPEAKER_14]: And specifically in Mendocino County,
we're working on at the moment,
[SPEAKER_14]: 11 separate regions and gathering
biological and weather data about those
[SPEAKER_14]: regions, but also the data that we share
as a community.
[SPEAKER_14]: So exciting about the living soil movement
spreading out through Jesse's efforts and
[SPEAKER_14]: the other people whose names I can't bring
to mind.
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is so important, this is really
important.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm tingling from the thrill of learning
about how soil and compost and mulch and
[SPEAKER_14]: all that stuff has been working together.
[SPEAKER_14]: I grew up on helping my aunts and uncles
on a dairy farm and all we did was manure.
[SPEAKER_14]: And my uncle won the best dairy milk fat
contest every year at the fair.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a completely natural farm.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was virtually nothing off it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was a dairy farm.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thrilled to be able to try and work in
that direction on this farm and working
[SPEAKER_14]: with Kelly and Josh about how to really
create our soil in a new way.
[SPEAKER_14]: But terroir is the one thing an
appellation is gonna save the small
[SPEAKER_14]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's that what makes you special.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's your value added thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're making certain certifications.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just to where you grow,
but that you're growing in the soil,
[SPEAKER_14]: living soil.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're growing with certain techniques
that are defined as organic and so on and
[SPEAKER_14]: biologic.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're making a very strict appellation
more like the French wine.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're hoping to push that through the
state legislature and on the county level
[SPEAKER_14]: starting here in California.
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Swami.
[SPEAKER_10]: That really gave a full spectrum
definition of what terroir is.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, Dan, we wanted to bring you in on
this because you're in the Willamette
[SPEAKER_10]: Valley of Oregon and the terroir there is
really quite special.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're creating a new space and you
have all this new information.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also you utilize local biomass terroir
material to put into your soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you, like us, make teas out of
vegetation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd love to hear a little bit more
about how you're utilizing your biomass
[SPEAKER_10]: terroir to create such amazing
terpene-rich flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of it has been picked up
through our relationship with you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: through the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've really enriched our,
opened our minds and enriched our growing
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, Kelly, the first time I spoke
with you, it went on for a couple hours
[SPEAKER_00]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was, you know, looking for some help
with a couple of soil issues we were
[SPEAKER_00]: having at the time and inquiring about,
you know, bringing your products in at
[SPEAKER_00]: some scale with the project I was working
on at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your response was more or less,
you know, you're in the Willamette Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is all around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the years since, we've really tapped
into that and have really managed to
[SPEAKER_00]: largely keep the loop very closed in
regard to the soil and in turn the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have had to bring in some
fairly large quantities of humus material
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to scale up on the level that
we've needed to do in order to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: make this business work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we bring in our original humus base
and build the soil, get to that starting
[SPEAKER_00]: point, we've been able to continue to
increase the biological and nutrient value
[SPEAKER_00]: of that soil through what's available to
us on our land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nettles, horsetail, burst lane,
the list goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fortunate enough to have about four
acres of mixed orchard trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of, you know, mulching and
we do a lot of these plant teas that you
[SPEAKER_00]: referenced, just super simple plant
ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And creating, you know, liquid fermented
nutrient and biology rich teas that are
[SPEAKER_00]: very easy to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely contributes hugely to
the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Duke referenced the
addition of fruits and I can't help but
[SPEAKER_00]: feel that the plum, apple, pear ferments
that we make on the farm, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically two to 300 gallons every summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use those throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really add a lot of diversity from
all the different elements of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's some that would say
phosphorus is phosphorus, but I can't help
[SPEAKER_00]: but feel like sending the soil phosphorus
from multiple sources is going to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: a more rich profile in the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that all of that tied
in with that personal connection that's
[SPEAKER_00]: being referenced here, which is a little
bit more difficult to quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all part of this complicated equation
that we're constantly trying to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: and work with and stay in tune with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's really no question in my mind
that all of this diversity and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, feeding the soil from a wide
range of different plant sources does
[SPEAKER_00]: really wonderful things that might be a
little bit difficult to quantify from a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific perspective, but we certainly
see it in our results.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, and you have really beautiful flowers
and we really appreciate the intention
[SPEAKER_15]: that you put into it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, it's a leap of faith.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Nick and Liz and you and just a
bunch of the people in the peer certified
[SPEAKER_15]: farm movement have really showed that the
faith is really, you know, really
[SPEAKER_15]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Scott helping us quantify it and the
books from Jeffer are really invaluable.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wondering from Duke how you may use
different soils for breeding or do you
[SPEAKER_15]: find anything like you have a really
special skunk?
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it like a certain soil or anything
like that?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just wondering, Duke, if you have
anything to add here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Duke, another question that I wanted to
ask you is I know that you have an
[SPEAKER_10]: incredible spirituality and connection to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very obvious in meeting you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's obvious in smelling your plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, you know, we've grown out a lot
of your varieties that you've given us and
[SPEAKER_10]: they've just been so vigorous and so
amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just wondering if you could talk a
little bit about your spiritual connection
[SPEAKER_10]: to the plant and why you're breeding and
your flowers are so amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess first, as far as like like
going back to know him, like what he's
[SPEAKER_09]: saying, like with our with our treatments,
right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's say we're growing calio in one
pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's say I'm growing, you know,
red kill skunk in another pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's say we're growing like something
purpley, like a blueberry or, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: something that's more in like the
blueberry gravy realm.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I take like a let's say like I do
what I do, I take a lot of different
[SPEAKER_09]: fruits and vegetables, I mince them all up
and I'm basically making like Pruna,
[SPEAKER_09]: like toilet wine.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not really, because, you know,
I'm not adding yeast and getting alcohol.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, breaking out and making a
fruit ferment.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I got orange in there, I also have
blueberry in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have all these different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's say like, you know, I mix it in
the water and I water all these these four
[SPEAKER_09]: plants with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to make the orange calio
taste like a blueberry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a mango or anything else, you know,
and it's not going to take the blueberry
[SPEAKER_09]: plant and make it taste like an orange
because they're they're genetically
[SPEAKER_09]: they're they're terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's helping to reach it's helping for
that plant to reach its potential for its
[SPEAKER_09]: terpene profile and overall chemo type.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not really going to switch
anything up, but everything that it needs
[SPEAKER_09]: is it's available.
[SPEAKER_09]: Through this and, you know, like with like
bananas that I have, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and the stuff that's, you know,
that's going to give us a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: potassium, you know, and certain other
things are going to give us, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot more calcium and other things,
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're also feeding as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: But those those things, as they're
breaking down, that's what I was talking
[SPEAKER_09]: about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, halfway through the cycle,
you know, I'm more concentrating on
[SPEAKER_09]: feeding the resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the terpenes than the biomass at that
point.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that that helps with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as like the the biomass growing
part.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so I guess it'll it'll jump into
the question to like why I'm doing and how
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing everything as far as like
breeding and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: If if I had a commercial grow or like if I
was you know, supplying a chain,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, I would be, you know,
more inclined to like monocrop rooms or
[SPEAKER_09]: beds or areas.
[SPEAKER_09]: And and I would be looking to hit the
maximum potential for just that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe there's a lot of things that
can I can grow pretty much dead on similar
[SPEAKER_09]: like I can grow a headband and I can grow
a triangle push about the same like feed
[SPEAKER_09]: and regimen and all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they do great.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a couple minor minor tweaks that
I could make to each one to help them
[SPEAKER_09]: excel better.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like if I'm growing, say, say,
like one of my skunks, I would need to
[SPEAKER_09]: feed it a little harder at different
points than where I would be harder toward
[SPEAKER_09]: the other ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: So like there's slight tweaks with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I could even like mix it up even
more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like we have old old Afghani that we
had from back in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's light sensitive.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like the the females that that
say like my chem dog or my headband might
[SPEAKER_09]: like it's too bright for that Afghani.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just does not like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so so there's a lot of factors
into like tweaking each each thing to to
[SPEAKER_09]: to its maximum potential.
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as the terpene contents go,
I find that, you know, you can pretty much
[SPEAKER_09]: mix up a whole bunch of different stuff
and a little kid.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can mix up a whole bunch of stuff and
it's kind of all lumped into one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it not only is like feeding it,
but it's also helping it get to its
[SPEAKER_09]: terpene potential without, you know,
you're not curbing it away from anything
[SPEAKER_09]: because genetically it's it's unable to
smell like an orange.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it's going to take kind of
what it needs and reach its potential.
[SPEAKER_12]: Could we talk about that just for a couple
of minutes?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I think that's sort of at the key
of what what I thought we were going to be
[SPEAKER_12]: talking about today.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's how to make the very best ash
you can get.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it all comes down to that
little gland.
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I am I wrong in saying that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anybody think I'm wrong in saying
that it's it's the terpenes in that gland
[SPEAKER_12]: that we're all shooting for?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, just a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I could just steal the show just for
two seconds.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that all right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Steal it for more than two seconds.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, because I've been struggling with
this for a while because, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: you always hear all sorts of different
things.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's sort of like the flushing debate.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, what's what's the truth?
[SPEAKER_12]: And the truth always comes down to what's
the science.
[SPEAKER_12]: And once you figure out the science,
then you can figure out what the truth is.
[SPEAKER_12]: I won't give an answer to what I think
about flushing, because that's probably a
[SPEAKER_12]: whole nother different show.
[SPEAKER_12]: But but what we're what we're beginning to
hear an awful lot about are people who've
[SPEAKER_12]: got inoculants, for example, that they can
tend increase the terpene content.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I and I, you know, and I I think we've
got to start distinguishing what what is
[SPEAKER_12]: going on when we talk about these things,
because from my perspective, and again,
[SPEAKER_12]: correct me if I'm wrong, and I'm just a
complete novice on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: What you've got and what's just been
explained is you've got, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: your basic terpene spine and attached to
that terpene spine are, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: little different arms that give that
terpene a different taste.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you've got an orange terpene,
you know, a lemon terpene, blueberry
[SPEAKER_12]: terpene, etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the it's the microbes that break down
whatever goes into that soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you're putting terpenes into that
soil, those microbes are breaking down
[SPEAKER_12]: that terpene.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, they have been also talk to each
other using terpene, which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't think it really has too much
of a direct application, which is
[SPEAKER_12]: interesting and kind of mind boggling that
terpenes is a language communicating
[SPEAKER_12]: system.
[SPEAKER_12]: But but it's the it's the microbes in the
soil that are breaking down whatever
[SPEAKER_12]: you're putting in there that create the
basic building blocks that are needed by
[SPEAKER_12]: the plant that's already got a
pre-programmed DNA to make a particular
[SPEAKER_12]: type of terpene.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's what's been explained.
[SPEAKER_12]: And and I guess where I where I get
confused is people are beginning to say
[SPEAKER_12]: that by adding particular bacterium to the
soil, they're getting a spectacular
[SPEAKER_12]: terpene expression.
[SPEAKER_12]: And other people are beginning to say
adding the base material to an existing
[SPEAKER_12]: microbiology is all you need to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm I'm struggling with with it all
because ultimately, the only thing that
[SPEAKER_12]: counts is that the plant makes as many of
those glands as possible and that those
[SPEAKER_12]: glands contain all of the enzymes that are
necessary to reassemble all of the
[SPEAKER_12]: nutrients that the bacteria and fungi have
broken down and that go into the plant
[SPEAKER_12]: system so that the plant cell itself can
make those individual terpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, so should we be
concentrating on growing the very best
[SPEAKER_12]: plant we possibly can that can grow as
many of those glands which will themselves
[SPEAKER_12]: have all these enzymes or do we
concentrate on growing particular kinds of
[SPEAKER_12]: microbes that somehow... Can I jump in
here?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, Swami.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, terpene, of course, is the thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the two questions you want to ask,
one is why is the plant itself making the
[SPEAKER_14]: terpenes regardless of what ingredients go
microbiologically to make it?
[SPEAKER_14]: And in my terpene expression, I found the
main thing that increased my terpene count
[SPEAKER_14]: was to harvest in the dark before first
light, really at 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_14]: in the morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's when you get your maximum
terpenes because if you look at a graph of
[SPEAKER_14]: the terpene saturation, it peaks just
before daylight.
[SPEAKER_14]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason I was told by a chemical
biologist is that the terpenes are what
[SPEAKER_14]: the plant puts out to protect itself
during the night from mold and mildew.
[SPEAKER_14]: It also puts them out to attract other
flies, other ingredients that can protect
[SPEAKER_14]: it, insects and so on, and drive away
others that it doesn't want.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a defense mechanism that the plant
uses.
[SPEAKER_14]: And part of the thing about creating
terpenes, I think, also has to do with
[SPEAKER_14]: stressing the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: So all of these things are part of the
genetics of the plant, the nutrients of
[SPEAKER_14]: the plant, the soil and so on.
[SPEAKER_14]: But harvesting at a certain time and also
having the plant be stressed, will my
[SPEAKER_14]: terpenes jump by a factor of at least 10
as soon as I harvest it in the dark?
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, because I mean, there are equally
amount of people who will tell you that
[SPEAKER_12]: the glands themselves act as a UVB
protector and so that they're produced
[SPEAKER_12]: pretty heavily during the daytime as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is where I think we've got to get
some data for it to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just add that it is definitely how
the relationship that with humans,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm quite certain, began.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, just to give you guys a little
quick, I put it up once already,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'll put the screen share up.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is inside a glandular trichome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you see these vacuoles,
there's plastids in vacuoles.
[SPEAKER_05]: The vacuoles are producing phenols,
which are alcohols, and the plastids are
[SPEAKER_05]: producing the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the actual building blocks of
cannabinoids and the entire terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are pushing up into that upper
secretory cavity and with the lights,
[SPEAKER_05]: different rays are hitting that,
and that's cooking into existence.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the cannabinoids, which starts with
CBG and then eventually goes into the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole variety of cannabinoids that the
gene synthesis can produce.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, the terpene profile
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So terpenes, which are hydrocarbons,
are in fact the building blocks of all
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and it's really interesting what you
were saying, Swami, is the morning thing,
[SPEAKER_10]: just being an herbologist and studying
herbs.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you go back into a lot of the ancient
Sanskrit and when there's either Chinese
[SPEAKER_10]: medicinals or Ayurvedic medicinals,
they do absolutely talk about taking that
[SPEAKER_10]: plant at very first light.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't have the science behind that
5,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: But they had their senses, and they had
their connection to the earth,
[SPEAKER_15]: and they knew what worked best.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you relate to the plant?
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've talked earlier about the
intuitive way of growing, which all the
[SPEAKER_14]: hippies in the old days started to do,
and that's what people do.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the culture of passing on,
third generation, what happens,
[SPEAKER_14]: how do you do this when it's dry,
when it's wet, and so on, just responded
[SPEAKER_14]: intuitively to the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: But for me to get the science from all you
folks is absolutely thrilling.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm learning so much here.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there is this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: The plant is so symbiotic with us as it
will also produce the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm convinced, that you need.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so by feeding it and encouraging it to
do that, especially harvesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, if you harvest in the morning also
when it's cold, you're going to lose a lot
[SPEAKER_14]: fewer terpenes and trichomes and so on on
your gloves and hands when you're
[SPEAKER_14]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: So harvesting late in the afternoon,
I think, is probably the worst thing you
[SPEAKER_14]: can possibly do for your for your cannabis
because your endhands will end up sticky
[SPEAKER_14]: and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_14]: Harvest in the cold and in the dark.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I can, I prefer to take the whole
plant and hang it upside down,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is the ancient way to harvest herbs
also.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, again, because I, you know,
is it is it a question of when you harvest
[SPEAKER_12]: in terms of the morning or night?
[SPEAKER_12]: Or is it a question of the humidity,
which is lower in the early morning?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, this is what we need that we need
to really nail down in order to be able to
[SPEAKER_12]: unify instructions on how to get the very
best terpenes and et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_12]: One explanation.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is going to sound really kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's been a lot of studies
lately about about the human bio and what
[SPEAKER_12]: we what we carry around us, not in us,
but around us.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when you walk by a stranger,
you are invading and he is or she is
[SPEAKER_12]: invading your bio, your space.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there's all sorts of bacteria and
stuff that just sort of hangs around you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is a theory that as you work
with your plants, those bacteria that are
[SPEAKER_12]: around you signal or cause to trigger
signals that are either in the soil
[SPEAKER_12]: microbiology or in the microbiology in the
plant or the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's that's very interesting
because the plant is so symbiotic with us
[SPEAKER_14]: because of our own internal
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it knows what what it what we need.
[SPEAKER_14]: See, when I harvest, I do a very peculiar
thing when I harvest.
[SPEAKER_14]: I go out the day before.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know all these plants are close to
ready, but I will go out and with
[SPEAKER_14]: kinesiology, I'll muscle test each plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I will ask that plant late in the
afternoon, are you ready to come in
[SPEAKER_14]: tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_14]: And it'll give me a muscle test.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes or no.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll say, do you want to come in tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_14]: And if it both says, yes, it's ready and
yes, it wants to come in.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I'll ask the third question.
[SPEAKER_14]: I say, should I leave you for a few more
days?
[SPEAKER_14]: And the plant will say no.
[SPEAKER_14]: No is better than that plant itself,
because listen, I took that seed and it
[SPEAKER_14]: was in my hand and I said a prayer on some
people even put the seed in their mouth
[SPEAKER_14]: before they put it in the thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what you're talking about,
that bacteria, that biome that we have
[SPEAKER_14]: around ourselves.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's also love, a mystical ingredient
that we put onto it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you touch the plant, you're putting
your vibe on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's a crucial ingredient and it
is that total interaction.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other thing is what are
terpenes in the plant finally telling us?
[SPEAKER_14]: The terpene, as we open up a bud and break
it and so on and so forth, that's one of
[SPEAKER_14]: the thrills of being a judge in the
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: I smell 600 plants, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's like a thrill.
[SPEAKER_14]: But what is it telling us?
[SPEAKER_14]: That terpene profile exploding into your
nose is giving you a precognition of what
[SPEAKER_14]: it will do for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's just like an orange.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you open up an orange, you already
know what that vitamin C and everything is
[SPEAKER_14]: going to do for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Your body knows it, your body intelligent.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the terpene is signaling exactly that.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is that pining or that mercy or that
linaloo, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what it's going to do because
it's done it before.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's why you select that
particular strain to grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why that strain grows for you
in that way because it knows you need
[SPEAKER_14]: that.
[SPEAKER_14]: This communication between the plant is
the most extreme in cannabis than any
[SPEAKER_14]: other plant in the whole kingdom.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to take advantage of that and
listen, listen to the plant more than
[SPEAKER_14]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could jump in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Swami.
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing that I wanted to say is that I
know that a lot of you all can relate to
[SPEAKER_10]: this.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of growers out there will definitely
think that my bud is the best.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just the fact that their bud is
above and beyond maybe other people.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it might be the best for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something that they've grown and that
they've put their intention into.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I suffer from migraines.
[SPEAKER_10]: And absolutely, if I'm away from my own
flowers during that time, I'm absolutely
[SPEAKER_10]: suffering much longer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Than if I'm with my own flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think, Jeff, you know, to go with
what you're saying was, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we can all agree that really
diversity is what we're after.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the one bacteria, the one fungi
that works that might show up in tests is
[SPEAKER_15]: really beneficial and it's probably
something to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I really feel it's the diversity that
really gives us the advantage.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's what really makes us it gives us the
adaptation that we might need.
[SPEAKER_15]: We might not know what organism really is
going to thrive in that moment.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why we're adding more and we
see the soil as a like a dinner.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the soil is the dinner for the
planet.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's what really does sustain it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And any tea or turpene, maybe fruit,
ferment or any kind of upper teeth and any
[SPEAKER_15]: dessert.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Any kind any type of plant botanical tea
that we can make.
[SPEAKER_15]: It may not be a direct turpene from the
plant directly into the plant like Duke
[SPEAKER_15]: was saying.
[SPEAKER_15]: It may not be giving a blueberry into the
plant is going to make the plant smell
[SPEAKER_15]: like blueberries.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think what it does is it gives
flavonoids and amino acids and it gives
[SPEAKER_15]: that that that micro that even finer layer
of support to the plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it gives it the ability to express
itself.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's the expression, which is the
intuition of the plant, that we're
[SPEAKER_15]: basically respecting its evolution to let
it respect itself and us and through the
[SPEAKER_15]: diversity grow the best medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think you're absolutely
correct there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it stresses an important
point.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is when when we're looking at our
soils, our soils are feeding our plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: Our plants only need those 18 nutrients.
[SPEAKER_12]: They can take those 18 nutrients and
convert them into all the turpene we need.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we got to make sure that the soil has
those nutrients in it so that the microbes
[SPEAKER_12]: can supply those nutrients to the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of times we just think it's,
you know, we're putting turpene producing
[SPEAKER_12]: bacteria in the soil and they're putting
turpene into the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_12]: That plant is an unbelievable,
unbelievable factory system.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it takes those 18 nutrients and makes
those things inside the plant in that cell
[SPEAKER_12]: where that gland is.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why that I thought that diagram was
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are so many things that are
happening in that diagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are 10,000 different enzymes making
that particular turpene that we need.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that maybe, Colm, I don't know
if you could speak to how you've seen
[SPEAKER_15]: biodynamic compost.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even Jesse, you can come in after this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm totally open to anyone asking
questions, you know, from this moment on
[SPEAKER_15]: and just letting the conversation roll.
[SPEAKER_15]: But to make sure everyone's, you know,
being able to add, I just think you've
[SPEAKER_15]: seen biodynamics is kind of a magical,
you know, ancient thing that's in our
[SPEAKER_15]: future right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's what's leading us.
[SPEAKER_15]: And how have you, you've worked with a lot
of farms, you've seen them not use
[SPEAKER_15]: compost, and then you've seen them use
your compost.
[SPEAKER_15]: How have you seen farms change based off,
you know, using that type of medium in
[SPEAKER_15]: their growth?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think one way to, you know,
understand it is, you know, I always like
[SPEAKER_11]: to kind of, you know, joke that Malibu is
like a gateway drug to biodynamics,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, but biodynamics should be this
kind of gateway drug to understanding this
[SPEAKER_11]: idea that soil is alive the same way
plants are alive.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we can measure the respirometry
rate of our soil, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: California won't allow you to use the
words health, healthy, healthier,
[SPEAKER_11]: and healthiest on any kind of label.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we've all gone through this.
[SPEAKER_11]: The, you know, idea of biodynamics as a
whole is this idea of creating a micro
[SPEAKER_11]: system.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, your plant has a terroir.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's this terroir of your own
garden, your own farm, your own footprint.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it goes into, you know,
your valley, you know, 11 different
[SPEAKER_11]: Appalachians of Mendocino County,
or, you know, the same way you see it in
[SPEAKER_11]: wine.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's kind of creating this own
individual ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in that ecosystem, you're wanting this
individual expression of the soil and the
[SPEAKER_11]: life in that soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: And enhancing kind of that uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's where, you know,
it comes down.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of questionable outside
inputs that you can bring in because then
[SPEAKER_11]: you constantly have to look at,
well, where do those come from?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what are those derived from?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the background of that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a pesticide or herbicide
footprint, you know, anywhere along the
[SPEAKER_11]: way?
[SPEAKER_11]: And, but essentially with this idea of
terroir, you're creating this living,
[SPEAKER_11]: unique ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the plants are thriving from that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have this kind of spiritual
component just in that you're
[SPEAKER_11]: understanding that it's an expression of
the best that you can be.
[SPEAKER_11]: In biodynamics, Rudolf Steiner,
he also founded the Waldorf schools.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I was fortunate enough to go to
a Waldorf school, but it's one of the
[SPEAKER_11]: ideas of that approach to education,
you know, through the class sizes,
[SPEAKER_11]: each child should be the best individual
expression of who they can be.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so there's this idea of really kind of
trying to reach your own full potential.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I always caution people who will use
Malibu compost and they say things come
[SPEAKER_11]: alive, you know, but if they're like,
love the bud density, man, or my buds
[SPEAKER_11]: really popped, you know, or like,
don't get caught up in looking at one
[SPEAKER_11]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's helping everything work
together, but this then should be a step
[SPEAKER_11]: forward to realize what more can work
together, what's local and don't fall into
[SPEAKER_11]: the trap of, oh, well, I bought this.
[SPEAKER_11]: So now I'm just going to buy more of this
instead of buying more of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And through that, you're really able to
cultivate kind of a different way of
[SPEAKER_11]: looking at your own garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you might not have animals on
your farm, but do you have a riparian
[SPEAKER_11]: corridor through the property?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, what's the history of that
landscape?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, here in the Lamid Valley or
certain other areas along the humble
[SPEAKER_11]: Mendocino coast, you know, the role of
salmon, the role of wild life that used to
[SPEAKER_11]: go around.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always say, does a bear shit in the
woods?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it used to eat the salmon and shit
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you have this sort of footprint of
that land, which is going back even a step
[SPEAKER_11]: to when we're talking about how can these
terpenes become the best expression,
[SPEAKER_11]: but understanding that kind of history of
that biology.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love the term, Scott, I'm stealing
that now, the animal husbandry,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, when he talks about animal
husbandry of microbes, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: that's, that's something that a lot of
people don't even think about,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, when they're brewing compost
teas or extracts.
[SPEAKER_11]: But thinking about the role of that animal
husbandry and everything that went into
[SPEAKER_11]: our soil, you know, we do make a potting
soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just don't use blood meal, bone meal,
feather meal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the quick fixes, but those are
typically coming from a slaughterhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless you can control it and you know
where that's coming from.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of those biological,
microbiological, genetic and ethical
[SPEAKER_11]: footprints on your inputs as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think part of it is it can be
sometimes as simple as being introduced to
[SPEAKER_11]: a simple way of seeing your plants thrive.
[SPEAKER_11]: That then triggers just a different way of
thinking about the entire cycle of what it
[SPEAKER_11]: means to be a plant, what it means to
raise a plant and let that be sort of a
[SPEAKER_11]: stepping stone.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that, you know, even adding that
biological ethical component into it
[SPEAKER_11]: should be, you know, another tool in our
bag of, you know, this kicking people off
[SPEAKER_11]: the bottle that we're all united for as
well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate the talk about ethical inputs
and not using blood and bone and not even,
[SPEAKER_15]: and even taking a look at, you know,
mind products, you know, the soft rock
[SPEAKER_15]: phosphates and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I think Nick and Liz, if they were
here from Green Source would be talking
[SPEAKER_15]: about, you know, the reality of just the
breakdown of material and having different
[SPEAKER_15]: material providing the plant really all it
needs and all this other stuff is just a
[SPEAKER_15]: bunch of carbon footprint potential noise.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was also wanting to come in and just say
that, you know, just a side notes that for
[SPEAKER_10]: all of the listeners out there,
the importance of really looking into your
[SPEAKER_10]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't trust a label.
[SPEAKER_10]: Call the company.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if you want to know more about
Malibu Compost, these guys are the most
[SPEAKER_10]: open book in the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: They are an ethical company.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they offer information about what
it is that they do, you know, call the
[SPEAKER_10]: companies, find out what you're putting in
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just can't trust a label like I had
said.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, that's that's something
that we've really learned through
[SPEAKER_15]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what Marcus has done here is created
a, you know, a hash panel, which which is
[SPEAKER_15]: the the where you really see what's what
the how the inputs have affected you
[SPEAKER_15]: because you're concentrating everything
and anything that was potentially
[SPEAKER_15]: carcinogenic or or or pathogenic
pathogenic or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: shows up in the hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know, Jesse, you're really into it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You really work with hash a lot.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm wondering how you've seen hash
change with regenerative soils and
[SPEAKER_15]: different farms.
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, Colin, by the way, I like your
moon gazer hoodie.
[SPEAKER_15]: Josh and Sandra, what's up?
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, Jesse didn't want to talk about
hash and regenerative soils and how it
[SPEAKER_15]: affects it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And anyone else can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can add and I'd love to hear Duke about
how you boost your turps a little bit
[SPEAKER_15]: more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and you had just talked about your
recipe as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hear a little bit about that recipe
to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess where I left off was we were
talking about like the fruit ferment and
[SPEAKER_09]: all that stuff and keeping it as diverse
as possible because it's not going to make
[SPEAKER_09]: the orange smell like, you know,
skunk but whole vice versa with the skunk.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not that we have skunk is not a
terpene.
[SPEAKER_09]: Blueberry is not a terpene.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there there are different ratios
of the terpenes that are in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_09]: certain combinations of those ratios that
give us the smell of a skunk, a blueberry,
[SPEAKER_09]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the idea is to to keep everything as
diverse as possible from, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: in my in my ferment, I mean, there's
carrots there's tomatoes, there's lemons,
[SPEAKER_09]: limes from different from different
regions to different types of mangoes,
[SPEAKER_09]: et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I take that ferment and I break it
down and then I add that to it by the time
[SPEAKER_09]: it gets to the soil, a lot of it's broke
down already, but the soil is going to
[SPEAKER_09]: continue to break that down.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other the other aspect of getting
plants to potential, I find, is like in
[SPEAKER_09]: the wild, you know, they're they're
stressors.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like like Jeff was saying,
you know, sunlight, you know, UV,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's trying to give itself some sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be an instance of indoors
or, you know, where we're trying to
[SPEAKER_09]: replicate Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to give it a stressor,
you know, being a very intense light.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're going to try to facilitate
its response to that stress.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they're wanting to kick in with
salicylic acid, I might go ahead and feed
[SPEAKER_09]: it like aloe aloe water to give it the
salicylic acid and then try to give it
[SPEAKER_09]: things to to produce more oils and
residents.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like Swami was saying, you know,
they do produce smells for a reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're not just doing it just for
the heck of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing it to attract certain things
and repel other things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also found that a long, long time ago,
I used to go up to Maine and work with
[SPEAKER_09]: this old man and he he believed in taking
a stick and kind of whipping plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, hey, it makes him more
potent.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to think he was crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I got to really thinking about him
like, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like if the plants get nibbled on,
you know, about, say, like rabbits or
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever, it's going to want to try to
repel that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, how would it try to repel that?
[SPEAKER_09]: It would want to produce something to kind
of, you know, a toxin or a poison to try
[SPEAKER_09]: to make that rabbit, you know,
say, hey, don't eat me anymore,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, so maybe it's going to produce
more more THC, you know, higher terpene
[SPEAKER_09]: levels to maybe try to stink it away,
you know, or keep certain bugs away.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I'm also into triggering a
response and then trying to facilitate
[SPEAKER_09]: that response to the best of my ability,
as well as like curving spectrum of light
[SPEAKER_09]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm big on when it comes to harvest
day, given I'm a little bit like I like to
[SPEAKER_09]: cut my light cycle down as the as the
grow, you know, comes to a close.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I'm down to like 10 hours of
light, 14 hours of dark.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then on that last night, you know,
about an hour or so before the lights come
[SPEAKER_09]: back on.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I'm looking to start chopping
as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cooler temperatures and everything trying
to replicate like autumn.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then as far as the breeding goes,
my primary my primary breeding is for
[SPEAKER_09]: medical patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take care of these really sick kids that
have like dystonia, autism, cerebral
[SPEAKER_09]: palsy, multiple sclerosis, GI problems and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really interesting to see that,
you know, it's not just THC, CBD,
[SPEAKER_09]: CBG, all this good stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you were saying, you know,
it's an entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's the terpene profiles that make
these things unique and that really makes
[SPEAKER_09]: them truly medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So one cultivar might help with
incontinence issues with one terpene
[SPEAKER_09]: profile of another, you know, helps with
the seizures and tremors and things like
[SPEAKER_09]: that muscle spasms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, I can take two things
that have the exact amount of THC,
[SPEAKER_09]: CBD, CBN, CBG.
[SPEAKER_09]: But why did they act differently?
[SPEAKER_09]: For this kid or myself or any of you is
because of the terpene profile and how
[SPEAKER_09]: they all act together.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been doing a lot of breeding that
goes along with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not just like an individual thing
like where it's medicinal for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also medicinal for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's also medicinal for other folks as
well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, yeah, you know, it'll screw
you up like a football bat, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's all great for people who
just, you know, recreationally,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's primarily where a lot of the
focus goes is into effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: And part of effect is smell and,
you know, the overall chemo type.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, of course,
I'm trying to breed on pest resistance,
[SPEAKER_09]: mold resistance, structure, leaf to cow X
ratio, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: So by doing all these things and being
able to grow them in soil and keeping
[SPEAKER_09]: things organic and growing to potential,
I get to actually see in my breeding steps
[SPEAKER_09]: where I'm at, you know, terpene wise,
because I do believe that, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's probably really one of the most
important, important things that that's
[SPEAKER_09]: going to be able to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I wanted to give a big up to Virginia
out there and all the breeders and stuff
[SPEAKER_10]: in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm from Virginia, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when Duke and I get together,
we give a big high five, Virginia.
[SPEAKER_09]: No doubt, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's an awesome place.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish they would they would change the
law and everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that would make it just a little bit
more awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jesse, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to hear what you have to say
about regenerative farming and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess we got to remember the
infinite complexity of all the stuff that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can't say one thing does
this or that without control groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you do a control group,
you take out the universe and all the
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting little things that that are at
play.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I definitely think genetics are,
you know, first and then having a very
[SPEAKER_06]: diverse rhizosphere for those genetics to
communicate with the biology and the soil
[SPEAKER_06]: and and also the connection between us,
you know, our own intentions and what
[SPEAKER_06]: we're trying to create.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we do that as a farm,
when we actually breed in a specific
[SPEAKER_06]: direction, I think that's probably the
most productive to try to create a certain
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next would be like really that that
soil, what you're putting into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I know, like, I do hundreds
of different genetics each year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the ones grown in the exact
same place and a very similar environment
[SPEAKER_06]: as far as the soil and the biology goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They differ wildly based off of what what
the genes are, what you know, selected
[SPEAKER_06]: for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also we find that the same genes,
when we take them and grow them in
[SPEAKER_06]: different locations with different
biology, will have completely different
[SPEAKER_06]: ratios of terpenes and cannabinoids,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Samantha Miller has even said that she's
seen clones be completely unrecognizable
[SPEAKER_06]: as far as a chemotype goes, even though
they have the exact same genetic based off
[SPEAKER_06]: of where they were grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: Light spectrum and biology in the soil and
other factors, the weather, the
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature, the humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: All these things are at play.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me and for hash production,
you know, I'm looking at the genetic,
[SPEAKER_06]: what's going to create the type of
trichome consistency shape.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we want, you know, good size heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want something that's going to catch
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, something will be consistent,
not just a lot of terpenes could be pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: volatile.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, certain CBD varieties,
they don't catch well, they grease up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, actually looking at the
physical characteristics of the trichome,
[SPEAKER_06]: how it's going to catch.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also you want to know that you have
the cannabinoid profile that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: looking for and that you're having
something interesting with the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I find the best way to do that is
building a very, very diverse living soil,
[SPEAKER_06]: attracting lots of diversity, lots of
flowers, lots of polyculture in your area.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then really taking care of it,
making sure no dust hits it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like to spray with even anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do, you know, as far as nursery,
I love the Natural Mystic from Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love doing, I do the 508 prep,
which is a horsetail ferment and the 501,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is a ground quartz crystal that's
buried in a horn, biodynamic prep
[SPEAKER_06]: operation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Early on in the spring, very, very early
veg kind of treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at that point, all I try to do is
keep them as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when they do get washed and simply Adam
is the one who does that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's a savant when it comes to just
like, paying attention to how to clean
[SPEAKER_06]: trichomes in the best way and really bring
out the nuances of a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's just an amazing gourmet
experience when you have really perfect
[SPEAKER_06]: ice water hatchery.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like free of any contaminants
that's been grown, living soil that
[SPEAKER_06]: hasn't, there's no dust, nothing's been
sprayed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an expression of the art that you put
into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to have that focus of intention
of cleaning it as well as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people can really just experience that
that rich terpene and the art that we put
[SPEAKER_06]: into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think everyone needs to remember,
like we're artists.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in an evolutionary process with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're part of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to think of dogs as a similar
relationship as with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when we put intention into breeding
for a function in a location, how fast we
[SPEAKER_06]: were able to create different types of dog
breeds is absolutely astounding.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went from wolves to having a border
collie that could understand 2000
[SPEAKER_06]: different commands and move sheep all
across the landscape.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's like unbelievably,
infinitely complex and strange that we
[SPEAKER_06]: were able to have that relationship with
an animal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really believe we have that with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And cannabis has the most ability to
create the most diverse phytochemical
[SPEAKER_06]: arrangement that we know in a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have this ability to create these
compounds that are immensely medically
[SPEAKER_06]: important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And but also just complex.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can create all these combinations to do
what we need, whether it is a
[SPEAKER_06]: psychological effect to help.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're all medicinal,
whether it's helping your own psyche,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's helping your body,
whether it's helping pain relief,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's antimicrobial, antifungal,
whether it's just the relaxing effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many things that we can do with
these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Marcus, we're talking about all these
trichomes and everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have taken unbelievable photos and
thousands and thousands of photos of
[SPEAKER_10]: different trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you notice a difference between indoor
trichome heads as opposed to outdoor?
[SPEAKER_10]: Or can you tell us a little bit about that
and soil as opposed to maybe hydro?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, more so what I can really tell her
that I've really learned to easily see the
[SPEAKER_05]: different types of trichomes, the capitate
stalks, which can be quite tall,
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes twice as tall on some cultivars
compared to others, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_05]: related to being indoor or outdoor or
close to the equator, but definitely the
[SPEAKER_05]: sessile stalk, which are a little bit
shorter, and then the bulbous,
[SPEAKER_05]: which are flat and lay on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I've really noticed is that all the
plants seem to produce all three
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cultivars that are high in CBD seem to
often hold a lot of that CBD profile
[SPEAKER_05]: inside the bulbous head versus the
capitate stalk and the sessile.
[SPEAKER_05]: As mechanical trichome separators,
whether you're using like a bubble bag
[SPEAKER_05]: type product or mechanical screens that
you're bouncing and cleaning over,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're really only getting from dried
cannabis the two types.
[SPEAKER_05]: They break off the easiest, the capitate
stalk and the sessile stalk.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bulbous itself is a little bit harder
to get off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally, people who make solvent
extracts or oil like rosin will get a much
[SPEAKER_05]: higher yield than they will using the same
cultivar for ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason that is, is because those
bulbous heads are a lot harder to get off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really seen, and I have taken a
lot of photos of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gone into that world really close.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really say that when I'm looking
at the plant, I would know for a fact.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aside from maybe that when it's like a
really hardcore field grown cultivar,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, you do tend to see other things that
have contaminated or added themselves onto
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant, sometimes like a little type of
fly or something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas sometimes in an indoor facility,
it might be like completely, completely
[SPEAKER_05]: clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise, the trichomes look
generally the same.
[SPEAKER_15]: That sounds really good.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of talk up here in Canada at the
moment with legalization is with outdoor
[SPEAKER_15]: growing, the 10,000 CFU microbial count
tests on the flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone's nervous that they're not going
to be able to grow flowers outdoors
[SPEAKER_15]: without irradiating the weed or putting it
through some kind of process, which is
[SPEAKER_15]: going to clean the ganja and make it
usable and suitable.
[SPEAKER_15]: Does anyone have any input on that outdoor
growing and cleanliness?
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe, yeah, anyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a little thought if you don't mind
me jumping in for a quick sec.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, Scott.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think one of the things that we don't
have any reference point to are how these
[SPEAKER_08]: microbes actually work.
[SPEAKER_08]: On a really basic level, it's a
competition aspect.
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's something negative on the
material, that means there's not something
[SPEAKER_08]: beneficial there to occupy that space and
to protect for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: In a lot of the no-till or living soil
facilities we've worked with in other
[SPEAKER_08]: tightly regulated states, if they're
failing for coliforms and these increased
[SPEAKER_08]: microbial counts, almost always they have
high values down in these disease-causing
[SPEAKER_08]: fungi because it's replicated.
[SPEAKER_08]: From our perspective, if you're failing
tests for too high of coliform forming
[SPEAKER_08]: units of something that will grow out on a
Petri dish, that means the conditions in
[SPEAKER_08]: your soil are more suited to
disease-causing organisms.
[SPEAKER_08]: It becomes a competition, more of a
concept.
[SPEAKER_08]: Down in Nevada, it's been really difficult
to navigate the total aerobic count.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't use something like Natural
Mystic.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll do a great job at knocking back the
PM, but then you can trigger a test for
[SPEAKER_08]: increased beneficial organisms,
which is quite insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're growing a really healthy soil,
you don't fail that test.
[SPEAKER_08]: You start to see the other aspect of it,
where if you're growing a lot of water
[SPEAKER_08]: molds in your soil due to your process or
your inputs, you are exponentially more
[SPEAKER_08]: likely to fail a test for those same
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the strategies for getting through
those tests is using organisms that don't
[SPEAKER_08]: culture well on a Petri dish like the test
does.
[SPEAKER_08]: You switch to others.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably a nine-hour conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Steve can comment as to how he's
seen his test results change alongside
[SPEAKER_08]: with the soil data and how that leads to
increased terpenes and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people don't know this because the
information has been quite protected from
[SPEAKER_08]: Elaine, but the populations of organisms
needed to express properly the CBD and
[SPEAKER_08]: whatnot, those populations are known.
[SPEAKER_08]: She hasn't really shared them.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just did an article with Sungrower
Magazine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Elaine actually revealed those
populations, which blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had done a tremendous amount of manual
labor on her farm and sat at her dinner
[SPEAKER_08]: table for two years before she shared
those numbers with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that she's sharing them publicly
in a magazine shows the transition that's
[SPEAKER_08]: happening and with the new education.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll leave the information to Elaine in
her own words to the article, but do know
[SPEAKER_08]: that these numbers are known.
[SPEAKER_08]: It correlates with that F2B graph that I
showed you.
[SPEAKER_08]: The people that have a higher fungal
biomass are absolutely expressing better
[SPEAKER_08]: terpenes and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Steve, if you want to jump
on from the testing side, that could be
[SPEAKER_08]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I admit it?
[SPEAKER_07]: To what Scott was saying and everybody for
that matter, I think everybody's right as
[SPEAKER_07]: far as terpenes go from what our tests
have shown.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as chemotype expression,
I think we got to also keep in mind that
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a variable there that hasn't been
dialed in yet, which is the labs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they doing liquid?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they doing gas?
[SPEAKER_07]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no standardization there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to properly chemotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's early.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think all the data's there yet
because we've been loyal to our labs and
[SPEAKER_07]: they themselves have changed their
practices, which has scrambled our data.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been hard to go back and really chase
phenotypes and chemotypes that represent
[SPEAKER_07]: them anyways.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm trying to say is, Duke,
you're right as far as your light spectrum
[SPEAKER_07]: goes, as far as your plant-based
nutrients, making sure the plant has
[SPEAKER_07]: everything it needs to produce and to make
what it needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Swami, you're right as far as harvesting
at night.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that more leads to the stomata,
making sure the stomata is actually
[SPEAKER_07]: closed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not gassing out your chirps upon
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as Jesse, I mean, as far as the
sun, nothing goes better than chirps in
[SPEAKER_07]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it's only a matter of time before
you find out what is the best moon cycle
[SPEAKER_07]: to harvest on and everything as far as
that and all the magic that goes behind
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then what Scott has been saying as far as
the F to B ratio, yeah, the F to B ratio,
[SPEAKER_07]: again, it's just giving that plant
everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it needs a little something that the
fungi is willing to give it, then yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: you got to have in the proper ratios.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those things is defense.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you have beneficial fungi,
you are a lot susceptible to anaerobic or
[SPEAKER_07]: to bad pathogenic fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen that on our data as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: The better our F to B ratio, the lesser
problems we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I've talked a lot, so I'll let
you guys get back at it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I attended a conference where one of the
panels was about testing in California.
[SPEAKER_14]: New for 90% of the growers in the state.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the thing is that what's the
difference between beneficial and
[SPEAKER_14]: malevolent microbes on a leaf or on a bud
or something like that?
[SPEAKER_14]: And that so far they haven't really
distinguished what they call a total plate
[SPEAKER_14]: count or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Jesse can connect my words on
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the idea is that they still haven't
really been distinguishing between bad and
[SPEAKER_14]: good microbes on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the state is now very aware of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's been a lot of pressure from
Kristin Nevedal from the International
[SPEAKER_14]: Cannabis Farm Association to change that
and be more aware.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the testing people were all of a sudden
given a task that they had never done
[SPEAKER_14]: before which is test pesticides for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: And also the idea that no pesticides are
really tested for being smoked.
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, Eagle 20 is okay for plums,
but we don't smoke grape skins or plum
[SPEAKER_14]: skins.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we do smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's when it changes.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are different conditions
governing cannabis than almost any other
[SPEAKER_14]: thing because cannabis is smoked,
it's made into edibles, it's extracted.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now one of the things they found in terms
of some of the microbial is that people
[SPEAKER_14]: late in the season were using Dr. Zymes
which is to prevent certain mildew by an
[SPEAKER_14]: enzymatic process.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's then detectable as a microbe
and also it contains yeast to make it
[SPEAKER_14]: happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that being done really late in the
season as a stopgap measure doesn't have
[SPEAKER_14]: what Steve is saying, do it in the soil in
the beginning and your plants are healthy
[SPEAKER_14]: and they don't need it, Scott,
too.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the key thing that the
pesticides now have to be much more or not
[SPEAKER_14]: even the pesticide, the microbial test
which people are afraid of has to be more
[SPEAKER_14]: specific and more sophisticated to say
there definitely are beneficial microbes
[SPEAKER_14]: that you want on there, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: What happens to it when it's smoked as
different from when it's eaten raw.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they have to be cognizant of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're only tasked to come out with
their pesticide regulations in California
[SPEAKER_14]: by I think 2022 or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're still in the process of doing
all that testing to find out what really
[SPEAKER_14]: has to be.
[SPEAKER_14]: So in the beginning in California,
they said all 66 normal pesticides,
[SPEAKER_14]: no go.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're still working out the
microbial test.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the key is if you're going to spray
anything, do it way, way early to prevent
[SPEAKER_14]: anything from happening.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you just can't do it onto those
delicate flowers or the leaves because it
[SPEAKER_14]: will test as a microbial good or bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or as I like to say, if you're going to
spray anything, don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Swami, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can all agree that the microbial
testing needs more help.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just now starting to have those
discussions on how they're going to be
[SPEAKER_10]: testing up here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really hope that the Canadian laws
and the people that are making these laws
[SPEAKER_10]: and restrictions are listening to what it
is that we're saying and what the rest of
[SPEAKER_10]: everybody is saying because even a dust
particle can come up on that microbial and
[SPEAKER_10]: it just doesn't make any sense at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got time in?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, to bring up the point about EGLE-22
and microbutanol and the difference
[SPEAKER_06]: between smoking it, when you burn
microbutanil, which is the active
[SPEAKER_06]: fungicide in EGLE-20, it burns as hydrogen
cyanide, the same stuff we kill people in
[SPEAKER_06]: gas chambers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to be careful about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also concentrates in trichomes and
it concentrates in hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we're talking about extracts,
we're going to get a very elevated level
[SPEAKER_06]: of that if it's used at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's used even in mothers and even
potentially a generation before,
[SPEAKER_06]: we will still see it systemically in the
next generation of clones.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've actually seen it seven generations.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've seen it in seven generations of
clones and nobody's gone any further than
[SPEAKER_10]: seven generations for microbutanol to show
up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to be incredibly even
organically.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, even when it's taken away from
all of the synthetics and that system and
[SPEAKER_10]: it's put into a beautiful regenerative
cannabis garden, it's still carrying that
[SPEAKER_10]: microbutanol for seven generations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also just the health of the plant,
like, you know, we're trying to get rid of
[SPEAKER_06]: a disease that powdery mildew,
you know, I guess the reason is for health
[SPEAKER_06]: or to sell the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there couldn't be anything more
unhealthy for a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plants have evolved to grow with fungus
and have them in their system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you're taking them out,
you're really destroying the health of the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant and potentially like opening
yourself up to other issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as like, you know, beneficial
microbes and stuff and testing,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it makes a lot of sense to
actually just culture out the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're talking about E.
[SPEAKER_06]: coli, the salmonella, the aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are things that can actually be
potentially harmful, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're smoking a joint and getting it
on your lip.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, let's just test the actual known
pathogens and leave the beneficials out of
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also to spray early on, I think,
is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to build up that
beneficial population, do it really,
[SPEAKER_06]: really early.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like just no spray, you know,
unless little biodynamics or early on in
[SPEAKER_06]: nursery.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going to do it, get it right
before that flowering time, get that
[SPEAKER_06]: population of beneficials up and not need
to have to add things later on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we really go ahead.
[SPEAKER_12]: As a non grower, but a consumer.
[SPEAKER_12]: God, I guess the other thing is,
can we can we somehow make sure that we've
[SPEAKER_12]: got the ethic, the rule that if something
goes wrong, you throw the crop out?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know, the idea is that
California being commercial and they can't
[SPEAKER_12]: afford to lose a crop.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, you know, it just doesn't work
that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got something wrong with your
stuff, you need to spray.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe you need to think about losing on
this particular one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's really important.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think as a consumer,
we can over over express our desire to
[SPEAKER_12]: make sure that we're getting clean,
organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to agree with you on that one
hundred and fifty percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just being at Lyft on Friday at the
business conference, the first talk I saw
[SPEAKER_05]: was by this company called Zail,
Z-E-I-L, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were like, we've got this
machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can do 40 kilos an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have 20,000 pounds of moldy
pot, we can clean it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just I was holding my head just
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like the whole this is how the
whole distillate market got produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not shitting on monomolecular
medicines.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's just be honest, this whole
distillate and fruit turps is kind of like
[SPEAKER_05]: the hot dog of the of the cannabis
industry right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the last leg of prohibition
based profit margins that people are
[SPEAKER_05]: grasping to the best that they can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just makes me nervous to think that
instead of that's why I'm so happy with
[SPEAKER_05]: this panel today, because it's like being
able to learn the information and put it
[SPEAKER_05]: into practice is got to be much more
effective and a better use of your time
[SPEAKER_05]: than trying to buy forty eight thousand
dollar machines that can clean your 20,000
[SPEAKER_05]: pounds of moldy pot.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Jeff and Mark, for saying that.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's so true.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was standing next to a rosin press
talking to Lindsey there at Eval or at the
[SPEAKER_15]: rosin press.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the guy came up and said, so does this
get rid of the pathogens when you press
[SPEAKER_15]: it?
[SPEAKER_15]: When you get the material at the end,
if you have like some problem,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, flowers will will it get rid of
it?
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, no, it's kind of like gold in
gold out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or if it's bad going in, it's bad coming
out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think, Jeff, you're right.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very hard.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's why we need to support
each other so much in this endeavor is to
[SPEAKER_15]: be be able to support each other,
to try and make the right decisions and
[SPEAKER_15]: have faith.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to say that, you know,
spraying early on and establishing a good
[SPEAKER_15]: vegetative health in your plants and then
utilizing predator mites is a way of
[SPEAKER_15]: helping you maintain the vitality within
your plants and maintain the immune
[SPEAKER_15]: system, because there is an immune system
within plants just like us.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we maintain the immune system
through a proper soil, through proper
[SPEAKER_15]: testing, then we have the plant,
you know, off gassing pheromones and stuff
[SPEAKER_15]: that repel the pests and the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have the predator mites that
stay on the plant during the flower cycle
[SPEAKER_15]: until towards the end, they come off.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're not seeing predator mites on the
flowers at the very end, but they help
[SPEAKER_15]: keep the pathogens away and enable you to
not spray towards the end.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's and it's also like, you know,
the knee jerk reaction and in the way that
[SPEAKER_10]: allopathic medicine, you know,
I always go back to health and well-being
[SPEAKER_10]: of humans just because it's what makes
sense to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's no different than you get a
tiny sniffle and you run out as fast as
[SPEAKER_10]: you can to the doctor and you get a whole
round of 10 day antibiotics because of a
[SPEAKER_10]: small sniffle.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's really important to look at
that sniffle or possibly bugs or a small
[SPEAKER_10]: outbreak that you have and look at the
whole entire system like Scott was saying,
[SPEAKER_10]: and as well as Steve was saying,
because they're dealing with indoor
[SPEAKER_10]: situations, you know, outdoor,
you can deal with it a lot better by
[SPEAKER_10]: utilizing companion plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, not having that knee jerk
reaction if one thing comes into your
[SPEAKER_10]: garden that's a pathogen, you know,
how can we deal with it more holistically
[SPEAKER_10]: to bring up the immune response of both
the microbes, the soil and the plant?
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is the future we believe through
the testing and through the reality of
[SPEAKER_15]: everything that's happening.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, all of the talk of soil brings us,
you know, to the trichomes and I don't
[SPEAKER_15]: know if anyone has any more input they'd
like to put into the soil, but it might be
[SPEAKER_15]: worth talking about how to cure the plant,
you know, to preserve the trichome and
[SPEAKER_15]: preserve the work of the soils done.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what people think.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, so microbial tests don't come up
just in your cure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to mention earlier when Jeff
was talking about the different organisms
[SPEAKER_05]: that need to be present in the soil for
the trichome, for the plant, for the
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics to actually be able to properly
express itself to its maximum potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought, you know, a way to be able
to tell if these particular microbes are
[SPEAKER_05]: really influencing the terpene production,
et cetera, would be in the essential oil
[SPEAKER_05]: world like lavender is considered the best
in this one region of France.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like the top quality lavender
for whatever reason it grows in the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: there and the whole environment that just
creates this beautiful terpene expression
[SPEAKER_05]: of lavender.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure most people that have experienced
lavender know French lavender versus
[SPEAKER_05]: German lavender.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wonder if that would be a neat way
to kind of check that out and if cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: will find itself in a place where,
you know, specific cultivars grown in
[SPEAKER_05]: specific areas will just express
themselves in a way that they won't
[SPEAKER_05]: anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's exactly what terroir is all about.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you brought up a wonderful,
beautiful example.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the other examples about terroir is
like, for example, roquefort cheese,
[SPEAKER_14]: right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Special thing, even if you're trying to
make blue cheese somewhere else,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's not going to be quite like roquefort
cheese, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also a thing about consistency.
[SPEAKER_14]: If we talk about wine, for example,
and their regions, they know that certain
[SPEAKER_14]: grapes grow best in certain areas because
of the humidity, how many days above
[SPEAKER_14]: frost, how many days of humidity and so
on.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's also the question of what is
the human content there?
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the idea that we have a wine that
every year is different, even though it's
[SPEAKER_14]: actually the same, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: We change seeds every year, but in the
wine, the vine stays the same.
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually the actual strain that there
is when they're grafting onto the vine is
[SPEAKER_14]: the same.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the only thing that really changes
most likely is, first of all, the weather,
[SPEAKER_14]: and that's the most important that's
different every year.
[SPEAKER_14]: But then, of course, in the process,
they might blend it a little differently
[SPEAKER_14]: as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the key difference would be the
weather.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the terroir in the region is the
character of it that comes from the
[SPEAKER_14]: microbiome and the human interaction,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's this quality which is the
quality of a particular thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what happens that year because
of the weather.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know cannabis likewise.
[SPEAKER_14]: It has a huge difference from year to
year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Even that same strain grown in the same
place at the same time in the same garden
[SPEAKER_14]: will be different from year to year
because of the weather.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we don't need to expect any kind of
consistency and celebrate the diversity
[SPEAKER_14]: because the plant then is the expression
of its microclimate, of its total soil and
[SPEAKER_14]: human and climate interaction.
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to change this up a little bit,
I think what Jeff said about ethics is one
[SPEAKER_14]: of the key things that we all have to
carry with us, that we are claiming we're
[SPEAKER_14]: making medicine, or I like to call it
inspiration, people, and that that carries
[SPEAKER_14]: the ethical responsibility to deliver a
clean, pure product, but not just clean,
[SPEAKER_14]: pure in terms of the chemistry,
et cetera, et cetera, but in terms of your
[SPEAKER_14]: intention and in terms of every way in
which you go about the sin of actually
[SPEAKER_14]: producing cannabis and all the way through
the drying process, the trimming process
[SPEAKER_14]: and all of that, so picks up the vibe of
everything along the way, the epigenetic
[SPEAKER_14]: change that happens from the time of it
sprouted with your blessing until it's
[SPEAKER_14]: actually consumed by the person partaking
of this become sacrament, if it's all done
[SPEAKER_14]: ethically with a high intent.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all of that has to do with the purity
and starting right with the time you
[SPEAKER_14]: sprout the seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a couple of types of curing.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's people in places that will be
like, I can cure my plant within seven
[SPEAKER_15]: days and get it to the market.
[SPEAKER_15]: It smells great.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's super good.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's people that say, you have to have
your plants totally sold on the market by
[SPEAKER_15]: two weeks, otherwise you're just going to
have old weed and it's just no good
[SPEAKER_15]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, there's regulations in Oregon and
also in California.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that they're writing about how
long you can keep your plants hanging.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's, you know, you have to weigh
your ganja in a tote, wet, and then you
[SPEAKER_15]: have to dry it and then put it back in a
tote and weigh it again.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's people that appreciate the slow
cure, which is say a 60 degrees,
[SPEAKER_15]: 60% humidity hanging on a line for maybe
two to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe a month.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some might even say, depending on what
kind of hash they like, they might let it
[SPEAKER_15]: sit for two months in a really good
environment.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some people Alpenglow Craig keeps it in
boxes in a room and the whole room is 50
[SPEAKER_15]: degrees, 50% humidity, and he can keep it
in there and keep the integrity of his
[SPEAKER_15]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Does anyone have anything to input on the
way to cure properly for the market and
[SPEAKER_15]: for microbial plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'd like to cut in on that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of to what everybody's kind of saying
though, it's all kind of connected from
[SPEAKER_07]: like having a healthy soil will help you
while the plants plugged into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then after that, you got to have a
healthy chain of commands and make sure
[SPEAKER_07]: that your facility is clean and that your
dry room is clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: And not only is it clean and able to dry
your cannabis slow and low, but that isn't
[SPEAKER_07]: the conditions to grow mold and yeast.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not full of astragalus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your air is pure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's filtered and so on and so forth that
you don't have a humidifier blowing water
[SPEAKER_07]: mold into your and all kinds of things
onto your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then beyond that, then it goes into
the trim room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are your trimmers wearing masks?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they have clean hands?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because again, they are testing for
coliforms, E.
[SPEAKER_07]: coli, and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the process starts when it's plugged
into the soil, but it doesn't end until it
[SPEAKER_07]: gets into the consumer's hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why you got to make sure your
packaging in a humidity controlled
[SPEAKER_07]: environment and temperature controlled
environment and that you actually are
[SPEAKER_07]: working with the proper lab that will give
you good data that will show you because
[SPEAKER_07]: that way you can take the data and
depending on what the data says,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can see where the problem originated
from depending on what it is specifically
[SPEAKER_07]: and how high your numbers are.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have a high mold and yeast,
yes, it became on the plant when the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: was alive, but the odds are it grew in
your drying room.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have E.
[SPEAKER_07]: coli or coliform, or things like that,
you have the chance that your grower might
[SPEAKER_07]: have touched the soil, then touched the
plant without washing his hands,
[SPEAKER_07]: or you have a bad trimmer that's not
washing his hands after going to the
[SPEAKER_07]: bathroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: So being able to actually analyze the test
results to better do your job is going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be key going forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where the science and the
growing kind of come together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: Swamy, do you have anything to say about
that since you're a judge?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, drying and curing is one of the
things that we really discuss a lot here
[SPEAKER_14]: at, what are we calling it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Swamy select.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason is that that is the final
process, the final test of your paying
[SPEAKER_14]: attention to the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you look up tobacco, it takes three
years after tobacco is cut by the time
[SPEAKER_14]: it's ready to roll into cigarettes and
they toasted and dried and cured and do
[SPEAKER_14]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything after two weeks is no longer any
good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, as a judge in the Emerald Cup,
Nikki and I, we get to smoke everybody's
[SPEAKER_14]: brand new cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And we actually can't wait actually three
to four months after harvest to smoke our
[SPEAKER_14]: own.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, right now we're still mostly
smoking from 2016 harvest.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Nikki wants to chime in about harvest.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually am the person that takes care
more of the curing and all of that to make
[SPEAKER_13]: it until it gets to the actual patient or
person.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the thing that I'm finding is really
the most important is to get away from
[SPEAKER_13]: plastic as much as we can in our packaging
and as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even we're hoping to eventually be just
trimming directly into stainless tubs.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then from there it goes right into the
violet glass jars that are ultraviolet
[SPEAKER_13]: friendly and all and just continue to
cure.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just find that to be so important.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so many people will spend months and
months growing a beautiful plant and then
[SPEAKER_13]: forget in the end to treat it with kid
gloves.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just be so careful.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't be careful enough.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to talk more about the actual
drying thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nikki came in a little late to jump.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the drying is we have a barn that's a
wooden barn, basically.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we emptied it totally out and sprayed
it with Clorox on the thing and let it air
[SPEAKER_14]: out for a bunch of stuff, a very mild
Clorox.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the advice of Chris Van Hook from
Clean Green.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it was open air.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we hung our plants up with plenty
of room around them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had a dehumidifier, which we didn't
really need this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: We needed it last year.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we like to go 60% humidity and about
60 degree temperature in total darkness
[SPEAKER_14]: and hang as much of the plant or as long
as a stem as you can.
[SPEAKER_14]: Upside down.
[SPEAKER_14]: And 10 days to two weeks.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it all really depends on the exterior
humidity that you've got there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so you constantly have to monitor your
dehumidifier through your machine and make
[SPEAKER_14]: sure you're blowing in ways that isn't
hitting the plants and things like this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you have to check.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when the smaller little stems start to
crack, then you know it's time to take it
[SPEAKER_14]: down and bucket.
[SPEAKER_14]: And put it in the toast.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you really have to keep monitoring
this process.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I say, 60-60 is what we like to go
for.
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes if it's really, really damp
and humid and moist outside in another
[SPEAKER_14]: climate, you'd want to pop it at 40 for
maybe a day or something like that and
[SPEAKER_14]: bring it up.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're very lucky because our barn is in
the shade of a Douglas fir forest that are
[SPEAKER_14]: 300 years old, these trees.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have this cool, fresh air that's
filtered through the Douglas fir.
[SPEAKER_14]: And being on the West Coast, we have the
cleanest air and so on.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's actually kind of ideal curing
conditions because there is a difference
[SPEAKER_14]: between drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then after it's bucked down,
then it goes into the... Well,
[SPEAKER_14]: at this point, plastic, hopefully not in
the future.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: First, we take long rows of ground craft
paper and all the bucked stems and stalks
[SPEAKER_14]: go wrapped into brown craft paper,
which can be opened and burped like a
[SPEAKER_14]: dozen long stem roses.
[SPEAKER_14]: It will go into Rubbermaid tubs and into a
wooden storage shed out in the woods.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the temperature there is 40 to 30 to
50 and relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's our natural drying process.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have the facility and the space to
do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the key things if you're trying to
expand your grow from a classic grow or a
[SPEAKER_14]: backyard to a bigger one, most thing
people forget is you need now
[SPEAKER_14]: exponentially greater drying space.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need almost as much drying space as
you actually had garden space.
[SPEAKER_14]: And in order to make sure that you're not
cross-pollinating fungal spores across
[SPEAKER_14]: plants and so on.
[SPEAKER_14]: You also have to be clean going in.
[SPEAKER_14]: Your lab coats is good.
[SPEAKER_14]: But then now Nikki wants to talk.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So after that, then it's the trimming
process.
[SPEAKER_14]: But cleanliness is in this case actually
next to godliness.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to come in really quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting a reverb here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to come in really quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan, over at Gnomegrown, you're dealing
with regulations of Oregon and they're
[SPEAKER_10]: telling you basically how to do a cure in
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm wondering how you're working
around those regulations so that you're
[SPEAKER_10]: still able to get a really good cure with
your beautiful flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And also some people talk about drying the
first day when they bring their material
[SPEAKER_15]: and having it a really high temperature
first and drying it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just wondering what kind of system
do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a low and slow guy
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really allergic to the notion of
letting the flower feel crispy on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside while we still have stems that are
loaded with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sort of built a reputation on the
flower that I've grown throughout my life
[SPEAKER_00]: has been consistently some of the
smoothest and most flavorful compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the others in my grow community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really just as a younger grower 25
years ago just kind of stumbled onto that
[SPEAKER_00]: through happenstance as I would let my
plants hang for a long period of time when
[SPEAKER_00]: in that ideal environment maintaining that
60%, 60 degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have kind of been my numbers all
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not afraid to let the plants hang
in open air as long as the environment is
[SPEAKER_00]: under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let it hang for several months
throughout my history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with the new regulations for rec
production here in Oregon, we can't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically it's a set I'm forgetting off
the top of my head what the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: number of days is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's 45 days from the harvest
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the curing process doesn't
necessarily have to stop at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: but 45 days it's pushing the boundaries of
where I'm comfortable with, but I pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much come to the point here over the last
year of working within the rec production
[SPEAKER_00]: system here in Oregon that I can live with
that 45 days, which typically results in
[SPEAKER_00]: letting the plants hang for three to four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically takes at least two weeks,
two to three weeks to get to a point where
[SPEAKER_00]: the stems are actually snapping and then
turning it over to trimmer and we've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower storage vault that we're required
to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very high secured area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually went with a refrigerated
storage container, which is super
[SPEAKER_00]: insulated and very easy to keep regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really struggle with plastic as
well, especially low density plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the Mylar bags and the commonly
used Turkey bags, the more high dense
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic doesn't seem to have as much of a
harmful effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically see through the processors
that we work with both for ice water hash
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction as well as we partner with
Evolved, which is a CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for as good a quality as our flower
tends to be, the extractors have struggled
[SPEAKER_00]: to pull the desirable yields out of our
material consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been looking at that real
closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the producers that are
throwing better extraction results are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a faster dry process in getting the
material to the processor in a more timely
[SPEAKER_00]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, Josh, you referenced the high
temperature blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had folks tell me that they know
some growers that have got a good solid
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation for producing high quality
flour that'll do like a 90 degree,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% humidity blast for like two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: To like really radically pull a lot of the
water molecule out of the plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and then shift it into a more low
and slow sort of environment until it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: to the point where it's dry all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tempted to kind of try this perhaps on
a small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really producing high quality,
smooth smoking flour is really our jam
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the extraction is more of a
byproduct in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really cautious of, you know,
turning things into any sort of direction
[SPEAKER_00]: that may have a negative impact on the
overall smoothness of the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavor profiles are just there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of flour on the market
that is really on point with flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really is a real mark of quality in
my opinion, as I sample flour grown by
[SPEAKER_00]: other producers with, you know,
good organic, sustainable grow
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it leave my throat feeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of well grown flour that
really bites the back of my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I smoke through a few grams of it
over the course of a weekend, I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling that throat effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas properly cured flour that has that
smoothness, I will rarely ever notice any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of sore throat, irritation,
even under periods of heavy consumption.
[SPEAKER_15]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, hey, Jeff, you know, I think it
might be time for curing with microbes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is the next book curing with microbes?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, you know, it is a microbial
process.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's like a fermentation happening
within there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, it's just a great
conversation.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as we are making soil and curing,
you know, it's just it's a great
[SPEAKER_15]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Jeff, what would you have to add
about, you know, this curing process and
[SPEAKER_10]: possible microbial interaction with the
cure process?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know, it's an interesting
problem because when you think about the
[SPEAKER_12]: second book I wrote, I've got to sit down
here for a second.
[SPEAKER_12]: The second book I wrote, TV with
Nutrients, talks about the two different
[SPEAKER_12]: pathways that things get into plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, of course, one of them is the
simplest.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which was all the cytoplasm and it's all
connected.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's where all the activity basically
occurs.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you've also got what's known as the
apoplasts, which is the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can go into a root cell wall and
then run up through the entire plant all
[SPEAKER_12]: the way out to the leaf tip or flower
through just cell walls.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those cell wall that pathway contains
all manner of bacteria, fungus,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, all sorts of things that impact
the way the plant's going to taste.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's always curious to me as to how
that's handled.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that pathway gets cleared out
somewhat by time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a lot of the bacterium die off.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think humidity has an impact on it,
but I'm not sure enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe there is a need for a book
somewhere along the way to know exactly
[SPEAKER_12]: how the activities in that apoplastic
pathway impact the curing process.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's something going on in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's an electrical charge in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's dust in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an interesting area.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I talk to that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think you just explained
something to me scientifically,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is to say if you hang a whole plant
upside down, you're getting all of that
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff, that cellular stuff, that's
communicating and it all goes,
[SPEAKER_14]: ends up in the flower.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the more you hang a full plant in a
longer branch, all that stuff now drains
[SPEAKER_14]: by gravity into the flower in the drying
process.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's also something about the
curing process.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think about?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, first of all, it's not it's not I
mean, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a great deal of truth to the fact
that you hang something upside down,
[SPEAKER_12]: you're going to get it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to get drainage, you know,
going in.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's not through the apoplastic
system.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's through the simplistic system or
simplistic system.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yes, definitely in the curing process,
hanging the plant upside down,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, everything you do to that plant
impacts all the aspects of things that
[SPEAKER_12]: we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_12]: So hanging the plant upside down,
you know, of course, the microbiology
[SPEAKER_12]: doesn't know what's up or down,
but the liquid in the plant does.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's a gravitation will pull
which which has got to have it.
[SPEAKER_12]: All of these things have an impact.
[SPEAKER_12]: And who only knows, you know, exactly what
these impacts are.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a need for a lot of these books.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've always said to myself, geez,
the last thing the world ever needs is
[SPEAKER_12]: another book.
[SPEAKER_15]: What have you started?
[SPEAKER_15]: What have you started, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_14]: The curing process goes on, you see,
once once it's cut and bucked and even
[SPEAKER_14]: trimmed, the curing process really goes
on.
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the old days, I was talking to and
we're talking in the old days,
[SPEAKER_14]: we would get cannabis from Mexico or
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was always like six months old.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was never green and fresh.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if it was fresh.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, one of the reasons Panama
Red was so red is that it was that old.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: The clock.
[SPEAKER_14]: See, now here's the thing about science.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've always asked, what happens with the
chlorophyll?
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't break down.
[SPEAKER_14]: It actually oxidizes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what does that have to do in the
production of CBN and the production in
[SPEAKER_14]: the creation of smoothness?
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: The greener, the weirder.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the more we read, the more rough it
is.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you cure it, dry it properly and
then cure it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't like to smoke our cannabis before
like April from the year before.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's like five to six months.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I think it's reached its peak.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can keep it that way, storage
properly for almost another year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think you're probably right.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you sure remind me as an old guy back
in the day when when there weren't really
[SPEAKER_12]: flowers in our cannabis and it was all
sticks and stones.
[SPEAKER_12]: And and when that's what we did smoke was
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, now we're doing buds.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the beauties of the buzz is
they don't have that much chlorophyll in
[SPEAKER_12]: it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, so you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_12]: But this whole idea of of curing,
you know, we have to start looking at it
[SPEAKER_12]: just like we look at the soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are clearly microbes involved.
[SPEAKER_12]: They are clearly impacted by all of the
things that we've talked about that impact
[SPEAKER_12]: soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, you know, some of you guys
are beginning to do the research and
[SPEAKER_12]: getting the information.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, as soon as we get rid of the
little Keebler Keebler cooking monster,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, you know, maybe we'll be able to
get, you know, I'm talking about Jeff
[SPEAKER_12]: Sessions.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to be able to get,
you know, universities in on this stuff
[SPEAKER_12]: and people able to really do the kind of
testing that we need to do, because that's
[SPEAKER_12]: the only way we're going to ever
ultimately find out what the right answers
[SPEAKER_12]: are.
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the meantime, it seems to me
everybody here on this panel, other than
[SPEAKER_12]: myself, are doing a heck of a job
gathering data and making some pretty
[SPEAKER_12]: interesting correlations with that data.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the more that we can put it all
together, the better all going to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: No question about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to speak to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the data that we're seeing is that
percent moisture when you put the flowers
[SPEAKER_06]: away has a lot to do with the microbial
population that you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that might just be yeast and
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you put it away a little bit wet,
you have an environment, the bacteria
[SPEAKER_06]: needs some moisture.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when we see equalized outbreaks
with like sprouts or something,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's because it's something that's wet
that has that moisture where those
[SPEAKER_06]: bacteria can grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a correlation with the percent
moisture that goes away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, this is we want to find an
optimization between this because maybe we
[SPEAKER_06]: enjoy flowers at 12, 13 percent moisture
because we get a little bit more flavor
[SPEAKER_06]: and terpene.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it might be a little bit safer to put
it away more around seven or eight for a
[SPEAKER_06]: long term preservation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's actually the bacteria on it with
that moisture that's going to degrade your
[SPEAKER_06]: your trim nuts a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think like you figure that out for
the type of strain and actually different
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene and cannabinoid combinations and
different environments, I think we'll find
[SPEAKER_06]: we should fine tune the percent moisture
that we're putting it away at and paying
[SPEAKER_06]: attention to our labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, to see what our full populations are
and actually culture out specific
[SPEAKER_06]: pathogens and see if we're seeing those or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another somewhat unfortunate element to
this whole conversation is we've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty immature consumer base in a lot of
respects in the recreational states.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of of new smokers
coming onto the scene who lots of people
[SPEAKER_00]: have just avoided it throughout their
lives simply because of the fact it's
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal and they're good law abiding
citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some a lot of misconceptions that
exist in the marketplace that some of us
[SPEAKER_00]: who have been involved in this game for a
lot of years have sort of worked through
[SPEAKER_00]: on our own and come to the reality that I
think most of us here on this panel likely
[SPEAKER_00]: share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swami made reference to the loss of
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have really found that with the low
and slow longer term cure process,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does tend to the color of the flower
tends to gravitate away from green more
[SPEAKER_00]: towards brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the market does not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market likes green, bright,
colorful flowers and and big THC scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's been an important part of
our evolution at Nome this year is just
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to the realization as we've really
expanded our production to a degree that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually represent a percentage of
the flower on the market here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my long established drying and curing
practices that do result in such a good
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking experience that most would agree
on, we're finding that as the market
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes more and more competitive and
there is a general oversupply we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: favor paid towards the more colorful
flower that oftentimes is not the smooth
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're really having to kind of play to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the harvest that came down in early
December, I'm actually fast tracking our
[SPEAKER_00]: process of getting it to market,
not with a complete compromise to my ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: but trying to split the difference and
find a little middle ground so that by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time we get to the end of this 100 pound
batch of flower, we're not seeing the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 20 pounds that are trickling out
here, potentially two months down the road
[SPEAKER_00]: that starts to lose color, suddenly lose
financial value in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, it's kind of a downside of staying
competitive in the market as a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational producer that is definitely,
we have got a lot of money and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: employees and just a lot of investment to
get to where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a business at the end of the day
and we need to listen to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the market tells us that we need to
weed out low THC scoring strains as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as I have a lot of value in a lot of those
genetics, it does not really pay off from
[SPEAKER_00]: a business perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like I said, it is a downside and
it's all choices.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, we're always- You gotta learn the
rules, for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: You gotta learn the rules and then work
with them the best you can.
[SPEAKER_10]: Learn the rules so you know how to break
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dalai Lama, one of my favorite quotes.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we're getting to the end of this
panel.
[SPEAKER_15]: We just really wanna thank everyone for
being here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it would make sense to just give
one more time to tell us your name,
[SPEAKER_15]: tell us how people get in touch with you,
maybe where you're gonna be really soon.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we'll be the last ones to do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And go ahead, Jesse, maybe if you wanna
start and then just we'll go on down the
[SPEAKER_15]: line.
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell us where we can find you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse with BioVortex.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can find me on the Instagram,
BioVortex and also Regenerative Cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: Farming.
[SPEAKER_06]: We created a website recently with Dan
Maher of Hightide Permaculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: To help educate about regenerative
cannabis farming and showcase some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: farms doing it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the farms we've honored with the
Regenerative Cannabis Farm Award at the
[SPEAKER_06]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Events coming up would be the Living Soil
Symposium, which is the second to last
[SPEAKER_06]: weekend of March.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was at the 23rd or yeah,
that weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also the Cultivation Classic and
they're both in Portland on May 12th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Colum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Colum with Malibu Compost.
[SPEAKER_11]: Easiest thing is get ahold of me,
Colum at malibucompost.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be in the farm in Oregon for the next week
or so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Farm in California for a week after that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bouncing back and forth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully at the Living Soil Symposium.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll also be at the Cultivation Classic
in Portland.
[SPEAKER_11]: We still recovering from the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully a lot of you got a chance to
come through and see some of these
[SPEAKER_11]: examples in action and the more
partnerships we can do and kind of take
[SPEAKER_11]: this living soil approach on the road,
so to speak, and collaborate on as many of
[SPEAKER_11]: these outreaches as possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: My partner Randy will be out at the Indo
Expo in Colorado here in a couple of
[SPEAKER_11]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know, somewhere.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds perfect.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're an inspiration to us.
[SPEAKER_15]: We appreciate you, your wife, the whole
family.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we really loved collaborating with you
and the whole family, the Nomads family
[SPEAKER_15]: and Jesse and Dan and everyone that helped
make the Regenerative Farm Lounge,
[SPEAKER_15]: Regenerative Agriculture Lounge,
I should say, at the Emerald Cup was
[SPEAKER_15]: really, really special.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got tremendous feedback from that,
Colum.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for heading that up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it's only going to grow and
it really opened a lot of people's minds
[SPEAKER_10]: and eyes, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, Jesse with the Regenerative Farm
Award and everything that you're doing for
[SPEAKER_15]: Living Soil Symposium is really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: We appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Dan.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how can we find you?
[SPEAKER_15]: GnomegrownFox, gee, let's not forget Dan
has a wonderful partner named Lynn.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she's amazing and 100% a part of
what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: She sure is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, again, I'm Dan McAllister.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find Gnome on the internet through
GnomegrownOrganics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: GnomegrownOrganics.com is our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bunch of info there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be participating in the Dragonfly
Earth Medicine panel on Sunday,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the 28th, part of the
regenerative cannabis conference going on
[SPEAKER_00]: at Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be at the Living Soil Symposium
for at least a portion of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little bit of an out of town
conflict coming up there, but we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: there Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cultivation Classic, we'll be
attending and likely making some entries
[SPEAKER_00]: into that event, which is another Portland
cannabis competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's been a pleasure to be part
of this panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone here brings such a unique
perspective to this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone listening has picked up
half as much as I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thank you all for letting me be
part of this.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yes, we're gonna have a really good
time at the science of regenerative
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis in Portland.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we look forward to that Sunday night.
[SPEAKER_15]: Duke, what's going on, brother?
[SPEAKER_10]: How can we find you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Very carefully.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just playing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's duke underscore diamond underscore
VA.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna start up a Dominion Seed
Company one here, here in the upcoming
[SPEAKER_09]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And next thing I'll be at, I'll be at the
seeds here now booth at the end of expo
[SPEAKER_09]: last weekend, January, I think it's 27th
and 28th of January in Denver.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then aside from that, I'll just be
working, working around the clock as
[SPEAKER_09]: always.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks so much for everything you've done.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have an amazing stack of your seeds
that we're really, really excited to grow.
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you for all you've done and
thank you for being here today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all so much for having me on and
everybody on here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was good meeting you.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I haven't already met you and good
seeing you, if I already knew you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And thanks for having me on and hope to
see you all again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Jeff Gardner, Jeff from Anchorage.
[SPEAKER_12]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, hi.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can reach me at jeff at gardener
.com pretty easy to remember.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am going to be at the regenerative soil
conference the first morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I'm going to go to the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I don't know where then I'm going
to Haynes Alaska.
[SPEAKER_12]: If anybody wants to come here and talk in
Haynes Alaska, it takes two days to get
[SPEAKER_12]: there and two days to get out of there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to take a ferry system and whoo.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a different world out here in
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to say one, one,
one other thing other than thank you for
[SPEAKER_12]: putting this together, because it's always
a lot of fun to talk to you folks,
[SPEAKER_12]: because you're the doers.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just sort of listened to you and I kind
of write about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I really appreciate the fact that none
of us have been using the word marijuana,
[SPEAKER_12]: which I think is a terrible racist term.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we need to get rid of it here in
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the marijuana cannabis act,
you know, the marijuana act.
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to completely get rid of it out of
all of our bills and everything else.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just interesting that this group
is sensitive enough to understand that and
[SPEAKER_12]: doesn't doesn't use that term.
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, it's been a pleasure if you if
you want to get in touch with me,
[SPEAKER_12]: jeff at gardener.com.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love all of you guys and all the stuff
you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, God, that Emerald Cup was
just incredible seeing all of you there
[SPEAKER_12]: and whoo.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I look forward to the next one.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to have to take a look at
this May Portland activity.
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like a like a like a good
conference.
[SPEAKER_15]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: We appreciate your perspectives,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Steve.
[SPEAKER_15]: Please come, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve or Scott or we can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought Scott was next in line with you
calling me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Steve Cantwell Greenlight Productions.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find us on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: I run our account for the most part with
the help of my wife.
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of suck at social media.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sorry if I don't get back to you
right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, you can find us in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in town, you look in prison,
clean herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely like productions.
[SPEAKER_07]: All our stuff is packaging glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always ask for the the back of the page,
the back report where you can see the
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides and fungus, fungicides and all
that report.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you're smoking quality herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, we're here in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find us on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Greenlight Productions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for having us, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Josh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate you guys and all that
you guys do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great time on here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Kwani.
[SPEAKER_15]: We love the dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Scott?
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Intense thanks to the Dragonfly people for
getting me to this point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very literally, I wouldn't have been here
without the early phone calls and,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, all the lovely stuff you guys do
for the community.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: My website is Crest of Soil dot com.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Crest of Soil dot com.
[SPEAKER_08]: January 26th to 29th will be at the
Regenerative Organic Cannabis website dot
[SPEAKER_08]: com.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally blown this finish.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been sitting around stoned for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come to this shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing a breakout communications and
let me just start over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pause, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: The day has broken up into different
categories.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have speakers throughout
the first half of the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we're going to do a Q&A in the
evening session.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're offering separate lower price
tickets to be able to join into those
[SPEAKER_08]: evening discussions for local people that
can come and might not be able to get the
[SPEAKER_08]: whole day.
[SPEAKER_08]: You definitely want to check into Susan
Wainwright.
[SPEAKER_08]: She does intense predator bug work and she
has some remarkable bits of information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Robert Faust is going to be there and
then we're going to try to commune and get
[SPEAKER_08]: to the nitty gritty in the evening
session.
[SPEAKER_08]: So intense gratitude to be able to even be
considered to speak with people that are
[SPEAKER_08]: lined up on this bottom.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to keep continuing to be a
communicator of complicated data and if
[SPEAKER_08]: that's the role that I can fulfill to the
community to help people better tune into
[SPEAKER_08]: their own intuition so that they can make
the decisions to direct the farm best.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really the dream opportunity with
my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you to everybody that's made a
contribution to that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Scott, we appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that little Rasta mashup back to
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was sweet.
[SPEAKER_15]: Your perspectives are invaluable.
[SPEAKER_15]: We love and appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all about the journey.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not about the final destination.
[SPEAKER_15]: Living soils really could use to be tested
after every cycle.
[SPEAKER_15]: So call up Scott or anyone in your local
area to get soil tested and thank you so
[SPEAKER_15]: much.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nikki and Swami, thank you Nikki.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you're there.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're special.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up, Swami?
[SPEAKER_14]: Nikki's sitting over the computer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Without her none of this would happen
actually and it's all a blessing of the
[SPEAKER_14]: goddess that way too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: The science of this is thrilling me and
I'm just learning so much like everyone
[SPEAKER_14]: said.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a great honor to be part of this
here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nikki is going to come and say hello.
[SPEAKER_14]: So how to get in touch with us.
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have an Instagram thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have a website with a blog that we
put up once a week.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's basically Swami Select on all of
them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Facebook, Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: But YouTube we have Smokin' with Swami
which is kind of fun where we interview
[SPEAKER_14]: people.
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually we'd like to interview all you
folks at one point or another on the
[SPEAKER_14]: Smokin' with Swami show.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then locally we kind of go to Board of
Supervisors meetings because we got to
[SPEAKER_14]: carry on the fight on the local level.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where it's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're writing letters to the state
senators and state assembly members and
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And don't forget the Seeds Exchange at the
Healing Harvest Farms right here on the
[SPEAKER_14]: Area 101 in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the date of that, Nikki?
[SPEAKER_14]: February 15th.
[SPEAKER_14]: February 15th.
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyway, you'll see us on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_14]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks so much, Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_14]: We love you and great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And thanks for all the help you're giving
us personally.
[SPEAKER_14]: On our grows and so on and long live
living soil.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys are an amazing contribution to
our community.
[SPEAKER_15]: And your being an elder and having that
perspective for us is really important.
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_15]: Marcus, it would take four hours for us to
truly thank you for all you've done for
[SPEAKER_15]: the community.
[SPEAKER_10]: At least four, maybe four months.
[SPEAKER_15]: And for everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you know, Rosin has spawned out of
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: You could say Terps has spawned out of so
much has spawned out of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you've always upheld organic standards
and clean medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you've been in the world doing amazing
things.
[SPEAKER_15]: Your family is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been really lucky to be able to
connect with you lately.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we just want to thank you with
everything that we have.
[SPEAKER_10]: And putting this together time and time
again, you know, waking up every Sunday
[SPEAKER_10]: morning to give out the information to
people is absolutely invaluable.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've added so much to our world and
cannabis so that we can all get better at
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how can people find you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys for the kind words.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, thank you guys for putting
together such an incredible panel and
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone coming together today and
sharing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess really, I would just like to
finish it off with saying happy birthday
[SPEAKER_05]: to my father, who would have been 68 years
old today.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is me and him and our first hemp
field in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gary Richardson, we think about you often.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_15]: My dad would have turned 70 on January
10th, and he's been dead for 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I really miss him every day.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I feel for you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then and that's what makes this
connection that we all have so beautiful
[SPEAKER_15]: because really every day is a blessing and
we're blessed to have each other.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're blessed to have the cannabis
plant and we're blessed to have this
[SPEAKER_15]: movement.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we'll just close it off with how to
find us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can find us at
dragonflyearthmedicine.com.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually an open book.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone can press the contact button.
[SPEAKER_10]: It comes to us.
[SPEAKER_10]: I spend about three to four hours every
day answering organic gardening questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel really dedicated to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So people who have questions out there,
you know, don't feel like you can't reach
[SPEAKER_10]: us just because we're on hash search or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're totally reachable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, we're going to be down in Portland
and we're going to be putting together an
[SPEAKER_10]: evening panel discussion with peer
certified farmers in that area.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's going to be a really awesome
roundtable community discussion.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that will be on the 28th.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's going to be following the
Forever Flowering Scott Granola talk on
[SPEAKER_15]: Sunday.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we will be in Portland in two or yeah,
his is on Saturday, but we'll be in
[SPEAKER_15]: Portland in two weeks with the crew.
[SPEAKER_15]: We started the peer certified movement,
which is closed loop farming, knowing your
[SPEAKER_15]: inputs, creating pure medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Joining together, sharing information.
[SPEAKER_15]: The peer certification is embodied right
here in this panel.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can we're making a website that'll be
out this week called Dem Pure Farms.
[SPEAKER_15]: And every farm will have a full page write
up of their farm and what they've done to
[SPEAKER_15]: become to become a leader in.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's more of a movement than it is a
certification.
[SPEAKER_10]: So find out about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much, everyone.
[SPEAKER_15]: We love and appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
