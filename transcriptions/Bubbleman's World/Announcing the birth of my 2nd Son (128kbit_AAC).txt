[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably noticed I haven't made a
video for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got Facebook beeps going off in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't made a video in a couple of days
because I was blessed with the birth of my
[SPEAKER_00]: second son.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very, very, very happy about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super duper excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened on August 27th at 5.10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 7.10 somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: My son was born at 7.10 somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, 5.10 West Coast time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has no name as of yet, but I just
wanted to sort of let you guys know why I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't been around is because I've had
this incredible experience and I thought I
[SPEAKER_00]: would do a wake and bake with you guys
here celebrating the birth of my son.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you can all twist one up,
pack a bowl, hit a rig, whatever you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke one in honor of my newborn son.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's happy, he's healthy, and he's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to pack up a little Astro Boy
that I've actually had curing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be since I left on my first
Jamaican trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sitting in the box quite
beautifully, some 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is to you, my newest little son.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of people coming by in the next
few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are Bubble Man friendly,
I'll definitely do little interviews with
[SPEAKER_00]: and have little sessions with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited for the birth of my son.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't often share these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have two other kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kept them quite private out of the
social media limelight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought it would be nice because I
shared one photo on my Facebook page about
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I would also do a little YouTube
video to let you guys know my YouTube fam
[SPEAKER_00]: that are out there that, you know,
not the haters or the critics or the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative commenters, but the people that
seem to really enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I haven't made an episode is a
very valid reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And geez, I don't know, what's to do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Puff more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have one more puff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have another puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Astro Boy was absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll hit some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven years in the cure right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven years in the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just found this the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little older than my six and a half,
which I have right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite different in how this one
stabilized That's the sound of me smacking
[SPEAKER_00]: up against the side of my key box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one here just stayed pure grease
its entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really greasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a little piece of this and
just squish it up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's greasy, so it leaves the tiniest
little film.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get all the hash off your thumb,
you get this kind of little clear film.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we'll dab up one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab up a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna use the dabber that was a gift
from another father, a good friend of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine, Martin Bissell from Roar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. B, this one's for you and your fairly
newborn child.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's been about a year and a half
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is a taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Astro Boy was very fruity and
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's Extreme Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took it deep down into my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could feel that taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my celebratory rips with you,
my YouTube family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please leave a nice comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please puff a bowl or a joint or a dab or
whatever you can find cannabis related to
[SPEAKER_00]: help me celebrate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: More great shows coming, so keep watching
Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
