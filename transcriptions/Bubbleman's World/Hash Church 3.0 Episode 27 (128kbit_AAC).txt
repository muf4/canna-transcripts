[SPEAKER_05]: too because wow got it got it welcome
everybody to oh geez i don't even know if
[SPEAKER_05]: it's episode 27 it is it's hash church 3.0
episode 27 and all i have to do quickly is
[SPEAKER_05]: grab the the link i'm gonna grab the link
and send it over to the folks that are in
[SPEAKER_05]: the wrong one because for whatever reason
when i create a youtube link and then i go
[SPEAKER_05]: live it creates a totally different one so
awesome i just want to welcome the few
[SPEAKER_05]: people that have arrived already we got
the dragonfly earth medicine in the house
[SPEAKER_05]: we got mr skunk man sam in the house who
god it was a while ago but you celebrated
[SPEAKER_12]: a birthday didn't you yeah no i my
birthday's in july okay well what was it i
[SPEAKER_05]: thought i missed something i feel like i
missed something that was some months ago
[SPEAKER_05]: so much of this happened people have
passed away and people have celebrated
[SPEAKER_05]: birthdays and there's all sorts of things
going on in the world right now and i
[SPEAKER_05]: can't really keep up but uh hopefully you
guys are all doing really well over in
[SPEAKER_12]: amsterdam and over in the coup although
things are blowing up here they had riots
[SPEAKER_12]: in the delft last night and they had riots
in rotterdam uh oh because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_12]: they don't want to be vaccinated but yet
they want to be able to freely travel and
[SPEAKER_12]: they're demonstrating to the point of
extremity damn yeah it's going on all over
[SPEAKER_01]: right now yeah i heard that there are a
lot of people are not necessarily uh um
[SPEAKER_01]: you know out there in the streets because
they're against vaccines they're out there
[SPEAKER_01]: in the streets because they're against the
mandates and there's a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are fully vaccinated who are against the
mandates and i think there's a really big
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between being pro-choice and
then being mandated so i think that's what
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot of people are upset about and then
there's a lot of dutch anarchists who just
[SPEAKER_12]: like to stir up shit and for that we're
thankful well unless they're harming
[SPEAKER_05]: things and that's not cool and we
understand no no exactly i just changed my
[SPEAKER_05]: mic because someone told me i sounded like
a phone call so hopefully that's a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit better there uh oh johnny b's coming
in you guys might not recognize johnny b
[SPEAKER_05]: there's only two-thirds of johnny b uh
that used to be here i think he's lost
[SPEAKER_05]: like 70 pounds or some ridiculous thing
rocking the push-ups rocking the sit-ups
[SPEAKER_05]: doing the walking and the healthy eating
johnny fucking b in toronto at lift dude
[SPEAKER_04]: you do your push-ups today or what you're
muted yes i'm 50 done i'm down i'm
[SPEAKER_04]: finished i did i did 15 push-ups on the
roger center i did 15 push-ups in front of
[SPEAKER_04]: the cn tower then i did another 15 putches
overlooking the cn tower and everything
[SPEAKER_04]: else and then another 10 so i'm past that
point um i feel fantastic good morning
[SPEAKER_12]: everybody what i like about it is that
means i don't have to do any exercise you
[SPEAKER_05]: did it for me see that's the whole idea i
got me going you got me going i've been
[SPEAKER_05]: doing 50 push-ups for the last 10 days or
however long it's been since you uh
[SPEAKER_04]: challenged me it's a 50 day challenge
we're doing we're pushing into 2022 with
[SPEAKER_04]: just a new push of life and you know what
little healthiness a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: exercise just nothing major just 50 a day
you can do five 10 times a day 10 five
[SPEAKER_04]: times a day i'm up to 18 and then i have
to break and then i can do another five
[SPEAKER_04]: and three that's my max and i have to rest
well your timing is perfect brother
[SPEAKER_05]: because uh we were just kind of talking
about something we probably won't get too
[SPEAKER_05]: deep in talking to today because it's such
a triggering and divisive conversation but
[SPEAKER_05]: i love that you came in right at the time
to show people that you know during this
[SPEAKER_05]: hectic kind of crazy time there are other
ways to improve one's health which is to
[SPEAKER_05]: focus on what you put in your mouth what
you breathe into your lungs what you uh
[SPEAKER_05]: you know put into your mind because
consuming cnn all day isn't the healthiest
[SPEAKER_05]: of things to do and uh yeah just kind of
figuring out other ways to be healthy and
[SPEAKER_05]: happy and uh you know kind of going down
that pathway johnny b and no one can deny
[SPEAKER_01]: it you've been doing it yeah morning walks
guys oh sorry on that i wanted to tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys that we're on uh day day seven of our
liquid cleanse of a 20 day cleanse right
[SPEAKER_01]: now so we're on day seven of our liquid
cleanse and it's been totally amazing like
[SPEAKER_01]: you know talk about changing your
frequency and upping your health and
[SPEAKER_01]: really stimulating your immune stimulus
response it's like once you start getting
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of digestion then you reach an entire
whole level of of healing and immune boost
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's been really great over here too
and i love it that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: health and well-being and johnny b way to
go buddy we've been doing uh 10 minute

[SPEAKER_05]: take health advice from someone that's
clearly not showing me a healthy lifestyle
[SPEAKER_05]: and you guys are definitely looking good
uh for any age let alone for you know
[SPEAKER_05]: getting into the 50s and stuff that's
awesome welcome to dr mark scaldone and
[SPEAKER_05]: the cats down under the stars everybody
dude one of my favorites couldn't couldn't
[SPEAKER_06]: miss it
[SPEAKER_14]: did we invite jona hill onto the show
today just kidding just kidding i'm bummed
[SPEAKER_05]: they didn't pick me dude i've seen some
funny shit i've seen someone say that iggy
[SPEAKER_05]: pop is going to be playing naked guy on
the pole remember that i was talking to
[SPEAKER_14]: sunshine sunshine kesey at the last oregon
country fair and they like reconnected
[SPEAKER_01]: with that guy yeah he's really healthy oh
yeah he's great he's like a super good guy
[SPEAKER_02]: out in the woods of oregon still that's so
good that is so good oh my god did he ever
[SPEAKER_09]: think when he was up on that pole on that
fretful day that he would be known
[SPEAKER_09]: infamously as the naked guy on the pole at
the venita show every dead head in the
[SPEAKER_04]: world is like oh yeah naked guy on the
pole yeah yeah that guy what would be on
[SPEAKER_05]: him oh my god dude i don't know i feel
like he hung out with bear right before
[SPEAKER_09]: that show well it was hotter than hell
that day so there were a lot of naked
[SPEAKER_09]: people in the audience and just so that he
got
[SPEAKER_09]: right but there are there are hundreds of
naked people there that day i think i'm
[SPEAKER_14]: pretty sure there were 20 000 people there
that day and minimal cars in the parking
[SPEAKER_14]: lot because everyone hitchhiked out on
buses to the country for that here because
[SPEAKER_14]: there was no the gas prices were so high
they charged three dollars to get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: show and the crazy thing is that there was
no water so when we talked to everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: who ran that show they were trying to
literally bring in water by gallon jugs it
[SPEAKER_01]: was 110 degrees and it was like over 105
degrees it's totally insane so yeah naked
[SPEAKER_14]: people gay lore well and they were
supposed to be making money for the
[SPEAKER_14]: springfield creamery which is ken kesey's
brother chuck kesey who started the
[SPEAKER_14]: springfield creamery the very first yogurt
with probiotics in america chuck kesey
[SPEAKER_14]: nancy's yogurt they were trying to do a
benefit for the springfield creamery in
[SPEAKER_14]: 1972 that's what that show's about they
didn't make any money because they only
[SPEAKER_14]: charged three dollars a ticket but i'm
pretty sure the dead gave him ten thousand
[SPEAKER_14]: dollars afterwards and obviously the
business is still still going and
[SPEAKER_14]: everything but and i love that the kids
getting licked in the face by the dog the
[SPEAKER_14]: dirty dirty ass kids getting licked in the
face by the dog we also those kids in the
[SPEAKER_09]: ground so lots of love you know came back
in 82 right they did another one 10 years
[SPEAKER_14]: later in 82 didn't they uh classic 1982
show of course so good the yeah oh my god
[SPEAKER_14]: i have the songs playing in my head right
now that was out there also tower as well
[SPEAKER_01]: at the oregon country fair so in the
parking lot and then they tried to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: again in 92 and we were all set ready to
do it and i was gonna help the backstage
[SPEAKER_01]: manager and we had a whole bunch of oregon
country fair running that but then jerry
[SPEAKER_01]: got uh you know he went into a coma so
everything was cancelled he got sick but
[SPEAKER_09]: there was also he he heard his hand i
think scuba diving but he also actually
[SPEAKER_14]: was sick then too yeah he got really sick
he was super sick and then the first show
[SPEAKER_14]: that he uh the halloween show at oakland
jerry garcia band oakland coliseum 1992 so
[SPEAKER_14]: he didn't smoke one cigarette during the
whole show yeah which just never happened
[SPEAKER_14]: you know and it was just anyone should go
listen to that show basically tore the
[SPEAKER_14]: roof off and we were roller skating in the
parking lot right because you roller skate
[SPEAKER_14]: from one side to the other at the oakland
shows because the basement this is too
[SPEAKER_14]: much information for everyone now but the
guy at the top he used to play wine
[SPEAKER_14]: glasses with water in them and it sounded
like an oregon because he would put his
[SPEAKER_14]: hands on the on the wine glasses with
water at different levels and he would
[SPEAKER_14]: play total bridge total songs on the on
the wine glasses it was kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: spectacular fucking hippies eh i just love
them all big up colin you're awesome we've
[SPEAKER_14]: been seeing you on our lives doing the

[SPEAKER_04]: mark i love the number 419 so because
that's one minute warning for 420 so i'm
[SPEAKER_04]: just off for a beautiful day and then i
get to spend five days of smoking hash
[SPEAKER_04]: that's all we're smoking i got everybody's
hash across the country waiting for me to
[SPEAKER_04]: try and just enjoy and indulge in and i
you'll be seeing it through the instagram
[SPEAKER_04]: post all week of all the different all the
different greatness i get to try from all
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys under there making amazing
products and it's just so rewarding being
[SPEAKER_04]: here at lift and the amount of people mark
and a lot of people have been shutting out
[SPEAKER_04]: hash church and have learned one guy came
down this morning having breakfast goes i
[SPEAKER_04]: watch you and mark and everybody on hash
church he had some rare disease he makes
[SPEAKER_04]: his own bubble he gave me some rosin to
try everything has changed his life you
[SPEAKER_04]: know what hash church changes people's
lives you guys are awesome and i love you
[SPEAKER_06]: all and we'll see you so i'm excited as
you can see i'll see you soon have a great
[SPEAKER_04]: day johnny b thanks guys you guys rock i'm
thinking of you guys all the time happy
[SPEAKER_14]: birthday buddy you're the best thanks for
the inspiration 72 pounds lighter today
[SPEAKER_04]: guys that's your morning walks dedication
and committing to what you want never give
[SPEAKER_04]: up never surrender and you'll get what you
want in life we'll talk to you soon peace
[SPEAKER_05]: johnny b that guy's a fucking inspiration
i got to say just a good dude all around i
[SPEAKER_05]: knew it was his birthday like in the near
future because when i first met the guy i
[SPEAKER_05]: met him in amsterdam and he was like and i
think i met him on his birthday like today
[SPEAKER_05]: like in 2012 or whatever and uh so yeah
that's uh that's awesome good that we can
[SPEAKER_05]: all kind of celebrate johnny b's birthday
maybe with a little dab i think we got all
[SPEAKER_05]: sorts of good things here i'm gonna load
up the dust and revere a little turp
[SPEAKER_11]: slurper uh hello everybody yeah this is uh
our 11th year deep kind of in tenure with
[SPEAKER_11]: sc labs and so yeah i mean it's never a
dull moment it's been you know one of the
[SPEAKER_11]: most educational it has been by far the
most educational experience of my life um
[SPEAKER_11]: but yeah lots of fascinating trends i'm
super stoked to be part of this
[SPEAKER_11]: conversation today hope everybody's doing
really wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: and so is it nice is it sort of a
different fall for sc labs right now hey
[SPEAKER_11]: this is our this is our 10th harvest uh
kind of season you know and as a
[SPEAKER_11]: laboratory you know each harvest year
really kind of puts a lab this is a lab's
[SPEAKER_11]: capabilities you know as far as quality
once things get busy you know and so so
[SPEAKER_11]: you know 10 years incremental progress you
know each harvest we've been able to
[SPEAKER_11]: optimize a little bit more and yeah i mean
we've um we we have like lab staff that
[SPEAKER_11]: runs seven days a week you know five days
a week we have an overnight shift you know
[SPEAKER_11]: so we've just kind of started we just
moved our entire system to like a two-day
[SPEAKER_11]: rush three-day standard turn around so you
know kind of just working on optimizing
[SPEAKER_01]: standardizing yeah i was actually talking
about the emerald cup samples just that
[SPEAKER_11]: you guys aren't over inundated with that
oh totally yeah that right now for sure
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah well so we we um the emerald cup kind
of entry window is is the month of january
[SPEAKER_11]: um so that's when samples uh entries will
be entered for the emerald cup and then we
[SPEAKER_11]: are also kind of right in the middle of
doing testing for the california state
[SPEAKER_11]: fair so the california state fair you know
from november 1st to march 1st is there's
[SPEAKER_11]: an entry window open for flowers across
categories from sungrown mixed light to
[SPEAKER_11]: indoor and yeah essentially everything is
really primarily based off the data for
[SPEAKER_11]: testing this year there's not it's just
such an ordeal to run a contest and to
[SPEAKER_11]: have you know judges that entries are
distributed to and so um the state fair
[SPEAKER_11]: this year they they were originally going
to do an indica category into steve
[SPEAKER_11]: category but they kind of caught wind of
this cool kind of terpene classification
[SPEAKER_11]: work we've been doing and you know with
the emerald cup and so essentially
[SPEAKER_11]: everything's going to be tested and sorted
into the primary terpene archetypes and
[SPEAKER_11]: then judged head up against each other so
you know jack train wreck sage durbin
[SPEAKER_11]: everything turpinoline will judge be
judged against turpinoline and then the
[SPEAKER_11]: things that really weigh the winners are
going to be around total terpene content
[SPEAKER_11]: and the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: so really like celebrating the diversity
of what this plant represents on a terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: level as well as you know kind of helping
to you know push and educate around these
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of other metrics you know to help
determine and judge quality beyond you
[SPEAKER_11]: know this thc number that everybody's so
focused on but you know i think in the
[SPEAKER_11]: future you know kind of total terpene
content and you know what the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: to terpene ratio is is really going to be
one of the more important metrics that you
[SPEAKER_11]: know people use to understand both you
know quality as well as how well something
[SPEAKER_11]: you know how well terpenes have been
preserved in it and then also how well
[SPEAKER_11]: that entourage effect kind of influence is
going to happen from that ratio of
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoid to terpene you know so are you
guys going to be testing for the new
[SPEAKER_12]: sulfur containing compounds that were
recently discovered yeah i don't think
[SPEAKER_05]: they were new personally just my statement
people have known about them for a long
[SPEAKER_05]: time nick ziegler said he's known for 25
years he sent me that paper and was like
[SPEAKER_05]: he was like whoa that's like i we studied
that 25 years ago he said the beer
[SPEAKER_05]: industry has such a deep understanding of
these styles and thioates that it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: even funny how much more we have to learn
in cannabis well that's because they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: like them well they study them big time
yeah i mean they study them to avoid no
[SPEAKER_05]: that's not true not not not yakim and
chief hops anyway and not the work that
[SPEAKER_05]: nick ziegler did they they were the one
company that instead of trying to avoid
[SPEAKER_05]: their unique differences they decided to
celebrate them and so that's why nick did
[SPEAKER_05]: all the work he did with thials and
thioates and esters 1,440 files he
[SPEAKER_05]: discovered alone in hops which i've
invited him here today because it would be
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing to have him here on this
conversation because we have kind of been
[SPEAKER_05]: discussing lately about trying to get a
group together that can discuss these
[SPEAKER_05]: things kind of maybe create a shared
lexicon and create this sort of sensory
[SPEAKER_05]: evaluation program that we can all kind of
you know feed into to create something
[SPEAKER_05]: that uh could take us away from you know
these these coas that are basically simply
[SPEAKER_05]: thc and and terpenes yeah i hear hear i'm
sorry no no problem i'm i'm really curious
[SPEAKER_12]: we've been studying these for a long time
we've been aware of them of course for a
[SPEAKER_12]: very long time but uh it it'll be very
interesting to see how many of them are
[SPEAKER_12]: found in cannabis how many did you just
say 200 or 400 in hops 1,440 is what he
[SPEAKER_12]: said when he came on right if there's that
many in cannabis then think about it uh
[SPEAKER_12]: and especially if they're they act
synergistically with uh cannabinoids like
[SPEAKER_12]: thc uh it's everything just got way more
complex way more complex and when you
[SPEAKER_05]: think of like at least from what nick was
saying he was suggesting that some of
[SPEAKER_05]: these styles are responsible for the shift
in the modulation of the profile and so
[SPEAKER_05]: most people aren't even paying attention
to these these compounds right now we're
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of on the surface with cannabinoids
and terpenes so it's exciting that the
[SPEAKER_05]: rabbit hole goes deeper and that there are
people like you guys on the panel who will
[SPEAKER_05]: jump right in with both feet into that
rabbit hole so i appreciate you all for
[SPEAKER_01]: that excuse me sorry i was just gonna say
we've been doing a ton of decarbing uh in
[SPEAKER_01]: the house and just like putting together
this amazing sav and the decarbing has
[SPEAKER_01]: been really in the upper floors of the
house has been like full on like terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: haven and it's been a really interesting
experiment because we've got two cats and
[SPEAKER_01]: the cats are fully addicted to the third
floor of the house where the terpenes are
[SPEAKER_01]: the most predominant chamber it's like the
collection chamber and they're only
[SPEAKER_01]: getting terpenes and they're walking
around acting so totally crazy on all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the persian rugs they're like
differentiating all of the different
[SPEAKER_01]: colors on the rug they're getting
fractaled out super high just on the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene so just wanted to
[SPEAKER_11]: that's awesome and one one thing i was i
was just going to add kind of um to to
[SPEAKER_11]: sam's question original original question
on the files yeah so you know we've known
[SPEAKER_11]: about files for quite some time really
nick ziegler put put it that much more on
[SPEAKER_11]: my map um from the work that they've done
in on hops with uh testing files um we
[SPEAKER_11]: we've been we've been working on kind of a
method to kind of be able to start adding
[SPEAKER_11]: certain uh sulfuric type compounds um so
we are kind of going to be developing into
[SPEAKER_11]: that direction but um you know even
without kind of you know tiles to help do
[SPEAKER_11]: the be a really fine nuance sorting uh
towards the end of all the different sub
[SPEAKER_11]: groupings that happen um we have found
that you know tracking the primary mono
[SPEAKER_11]: incest with terpenes and using them as a
as a tool to sort kind of can really
[SPEAKER_11]: capture for the most part all the primary
smells or groups um but yeah i think once
[SPEAKER_11]: you start getting into files and some of
these other trace compounds that really
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of define some of the nuance of how
the sub groupings kind of open up um you
[SPEAKER_11]: know there's so much more to be kind of uh
to be learned from that and i'm definitely
[SPEAKER_09]: really excited for it do you know they're
extremely the human olfactory senses are
[SPEAKER_09]: very tuned to these molecules at extremely
low concentrations so you know that they
[SPEAKER_09]: put an odorant in natural gas because
natural gas has no odor right i think what
[SPEAKER_09]: they're putting in natural gas more
captain yes butane thiol and so you can
[SPEAKER_09]: imagine that these things are are
basically sensitive at really i think it's
[SPEAKER_09]: like almost part per trillion levels right
so the human olfactory is so sensitive to
[SPEAKER_09]: those that these things could be in there
and just very very trace quantities
[SPEAKER_09]: fleeting quantities that essentially make
them not quantifiable or not measurable as
[SPEAKER_09]: you see but you could certainly taste the
difference when you when you consume it
[SPEAKER_12]: does anybody know if these compounds act
do they modulate thc or act uh do they
[SPEAKER_05]: potentiate thc anybody know i have a
feeling nick knows but he's not here yet
[SPEAKER_05]: and i have invited him and welcome to wook
sauce who is in the house with girls in
[SPEAKER_05]: green booyaka alice will be here shortly i
knew she would if she wasn't yep just
[SPEAKER_02]: handling some stuff for the death row
hearing up for legends of hash i am i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting patiently for my jars to get here
so i can get everything packed up and send
[SPEAKER_02]: it on down with the homies to uh get the
entries in and stuff i'm i'm pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: excited it's gonna be a good event dude
i'm not even going and i'm pretty excited
[SPEAKER_05]: i got to admit the amount of energy that
adison and kevin have put into this and
[SPEAKER_05]: the stuff that they've kind of organized
around it i mean getting calyx getting
[SPEAKER_05]: calyx jars for legends of hash was like
it's just so much different and grown out
[SPEAKER_05]: from what we created it as and i'm uh and
i'm pretty excited that they've maintained
[SPEAKER_05]: the integrity they've said no to all sorts
of companies that tried to sponsor because
[SPEAKER_05]: legends just didn't line up with those
companies and i thought that was amazing
[SPEAKER_05]: as well so i kind of got to give those
guys a shout out for uh for really doing a
[SPEAKER_05]: great job i can't wait for the event to to
kind of to get here me too i'm so can't
[SPEAKER_02]: wait to meet all the hash makers that end
up going everyone that i've seen is going
[SPEAKER_02]: it's pretty amazing and it's gonna be a
great night i'm excited hell yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely i'm freezing up a little bit so
when when you guys notice me freeze up
[SPEAKER_05]: just kind of keep talking as you as you do
i've got the uh the beta uh elon musk
[SPEAKER_05]: starlink internet going on and we get a
little cut out here and there so have
[SPEAKER_14]: patience with me everyone fair enough fair
enough well jump in and flann i was just
[SPEAKER_14]: wondering that you you might be still be
around or not but i was just wondering
[SPEAKER_14]: what and what some of the strains you
might be putting in to the event or just
[SPEAKER_14]: you know bringing but some strains or how
about this alec what are some uh new
[SPEAKER_14]: trends and smells and flavors that you're
seeing out of the farms this year that are
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of dominating or just kind of going
off this year um well well what's
[SPEAKER_11]: dominating is definitely that carry off
lean liming like pair like they carry off
[SPEAKER_11]: lean liming co-balance kind of all the
desserts that um you know in the emerald
[SPEAKER_11]: cup last year we saw that profile was
about 54 of all the entries across
[SPEAKER_11]: categories um and and that would end you
know that the popularity of that profile
[SPEAKER_11]: hasn't really slowed down and so i would
you know believe it to be closer to 60 65
[SPEAKER_11]: percent of the cannabis growing in
california um it's probably that profile
[SPEAKER_11]: or close to it so you know you do see the
mod umaginate of profiles that's kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: happening as people are just like kind of
chasing the thc number you know and kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of going for these care often dominant
type um careful in liming combos um you
[SPEAKER_11]: know it's an amazing profile but you know
it's also you know the most over kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: grown profile at this point so you know
that's kind of where i'm really excited
[SPEAKER_11]: for kind of the work we do with the
emerald cup and then what we're doing this
[SPEAKER_11]: year with the state fair which is kind of
presenting cannabis to a whole new
[SPEAKER_11]: audience of cannabis you know novice
people to kind of really show the range of
[SPEAKER_11]: diversity of what this plant offers and
you know kind of honor it in that way so
[SPEAKER_11]: that you know kind of it's not just you
know kind of the you know popularity bias
[SPEAKER_11]: doesn't just kind of sweep the cup and
then have a you know that much more of an
[SPEAKER_11]: effect on homogenizing the urban the
market
[SPEAKER_12]: very good early our early research showed
that limeline definitely potentiated thc
[SPEAKER_12]: and modulated the effects and but carry
out them did not particularly but
[SPEAKER_06]: that's a different issue that i'm talking
about sam i had a quick question on that
[SPEAKER_11]: you know i'm curious as to like um you
know how you kind of controlled some of
[SPEAKER_11]: those variables did you take strains that
were high in these you know turpin profile
[SPEAKER_12]: no no we we got we got pure thc 25
milligrams put in a volcano every time uh
[SPEAKER_12]: and then we spiked it with just a single
terpy so when i did that experiment at
[SPEAKER_05]: your house i did it through a roar bong
okay yeah well i used roars a few times
[SPEAKER_12]: you're right but mostly what we used was
those thick like brillo pad pad things
[SPEAKER_12]: that were available with the volcano and
we measured it out with a very precise
[SPEAKER_12]: scale and we vaped them all identically
and uh pure thc gets you high but with the
[SPEAKER_12]: right terpenes you get way higher how much
terpene did you add oh as small as we
[SPEAKER_12]: could add a really tiny spot i mean we
were using pipettes the smallest ones we
[SPEAKER_12]: we had and uh we made it so that they were
really really uh uh tiny tiny amounts well
[SPEAKER_11]: you know and and something i would mention
too that's where i feel like in the future
[SPEAKER_11]: just you know such you know such a value
in this idea of the canal to turf ratio
[SPEAKER_11]: right because because what we see you know
five of the six primary turpentine
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis or mono terpenes you know which
begin to boil off of room temperature so
[SPEAKER_11]: they're therefore the biggest spoilage
indicator of you know kind of you know
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis that's lost its terpene content
right and you know in so much of what we
[SPEAKER_11]: see in the state in california you know a
farmer puts their best foot forward you
[SPEAKER_11]: know and has all the controls to preserve
terpenes in their supply chain to the
[SPEAKER_11]: point where they pass it off but then it
goes through a distributor and in the
[SPEAKER_11]: possession of the distributor in their
chain of custody you know pretty much
[SPEAKER_11]: loses 60 80 percent of the terpene content
that was there and you know in a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: ways is indistinguishable to the eye you
know it's a two-sided coin though alex
[SPEAKER_12]: because for example terpenes the most
you're right the mono terpenes can be
[SPEAKER_12]: incredibly volatile and significant
amounts can be lost between a living plant
[SPEAKER_12]: at harvest and two weeks later or even a
month later after curing etc but uh the
[SPEAKER_12]: truth of it is i found that cannabis is
fresh it's been dried for two weeks it
[SPEAKER_12]: could theoretically be smoked but it's
really super fresh that uh i found some
[SPEAKER_12]: really high terpene content stuff actually
gives me laryngitis well you know and i
[SPEAKER_12]: think yes yeah i'm sorry go ahead no no
i'm just saying so i i think some of the
[SPEAKER_12]: more volatile ones you have to be careful
about about extreme amounts of uh and uh i
[SPEAKER_12]: got laryngitis every year for like five or
six years in a row when i was living in
[SPEAKER_12]: california growing herb and then uh i
moved over here and started making dry
[SPEAKER_12]: sift and i never got laryngitis again well
the one thing the one thing i was going to
[SPEAKER_11]: mention and sam you're very right i think
and i think that's where you know kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: um translation from smell to flavor and
and uh and and and the character of a
[SPEAKER_11]: profile how it kind of translates to smoke
i mean you know certain certain examples
[SPEAKER_11]: of an awesomening dominant strain kind of
yeah burn your cinder throat you know and
[SPEAKER_11]: so i think you know there's a lot there to
what you're saying but but my main point
[SPEAKER_11]: around this cannabis herb ratio right
because so you know so much of what we see
[SPEAKER_11]: is um you know the the average of terpene
content and flour across everything we've
[SPEAKER_11]: ever tested over 200 000 samples is is
like 1.4 average whereas the potential of
[SPEAKER_11]: what we see whenever it's done most
optimally is three to five and a half
[SPEAKER_11]: percent in dried flour so you know so from
what we see a market average of terpene
[SPEAKER_12]: content flour is is 100 to 200 percent do
you think the majority of that low 1.5
[SPEAKER_12]: percentage is driven by genetics or by
growing or processing or all three i think
[SPEAKER_11]: all three yeah i think all three for sure
um you know but but but my but but the big
[SPEAKER_11]: point that i was just going to make right
is you know if you had you know you know
[SPEAKER_11]: just speaking in terms of this idea of the
entourage effect and the nuanced
[SPEAKER_11]: uniqueness that strains have to offer
whenever they are preserved right because
[SPEAKER_11]: you know if you had a strain that tested
like legitimately 30 35 percent thca but
[SPEAKER_11]: it was dried and cured like shit and it
smells like hay and it has 0.2 percent
[SPEAKER_11]: terpene content that's like a 90 to 1
cannabinoid to terpene ratio right and in
[SPEAKER_11]: my opinion that's in the future what
really finds biomass right there's no
[SPEAKER_11]: other value for that to be represented as
a flour for connoisseur consumption
[SPEAKER_11]: purposes or for isolating thc yeah yeah
exactly exactly well yeah and so so and so
[SPEAKER_11]: so yeah so in an instance where all the
terpene content is gone and then 90 to 1
[SPEAKER_11]: terp can have deterp ratios there you know
there's not really an entourage effect
[SPEAKER_11]: that's going to be present whether if the
terpene was originally terpene to make it
[SPEAKER_11]: more stimulating or creative or if it was
higher in myrcine you know it doesn't
[SPEAKER_11]: really matter anymore because it's 90 to 1
so it's kind of absent terpene or
[SPEAKER_11]: entourage and so really it's just a very
thc base effect you know so it's like the
[SPEAKER_11]: most value for that would be to distill it
you know add terpenes or something at the
[SPEAKER_11]: end but but from what we see right like
you know kind of you could have a strain
[SPEAKER_11]: say you know that has 15 percent thc but
it was dried and cured immaculately like
[SPEAKER_11]: with terpene preservation and ultimate
like kind of focus you know and it might
[SPEAKER_11]: have three to five and a half percent you
know terpene content and dried flour
[SPEAKER_11]: that's a three to one cannabinoid to
terpene ratio right so whether that
[SPEAKER_11]: terpene was limonene whether that terpene
was terpenylene whether that terpene was
[SPEAKER_11]: myrcine right that the significance and
the uniqueness of that entourage effect
[SPEAKER_11]: can be pronounced right as opposed to that
90 to 1 right one other question with all
[SPEAKER_12]: this analysis that with they have they're
not damaged samples but they're they're
[SPEAKER_12]: done properly and they're really primarily
just one terpene um i mean with uncertain
[SPEAKER_11]: on the side on the end spectrums of the
rainbow with terpenylene or with like
[SPEAKER_11]: myrcine you see you know so many examples
where it's just really primary amounts of
[SPEAKER_11]: that one term you know with very
subsequent you know secondary or tertiary
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of terpene presence but you know
you'll see the vast majority of the
[SPEAKER_11]: representation of that of that profile
would be one a single or terpene terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: but um but you know so so again though in
this example you know i think kind of um
[SPEAKER_11]: you know the the yeah just the ratio is i
think can be one of the most important
[SPEAKER_11]: things i'm sorry i kind of like slightly
like missed miss the point i was going to
[SPEAKER_09]: just hit on but um that's perfectly all
right yeah no i i can explain why the
[SPEAKER_09]: ratio is important is because what you're
changing when you take freshly picked
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis to dried cannabis is the amount
of water that's in there and so the the
[SPEAKER_09]: percentage of the relative percentage of
terpenes to to overall mass of plant
[SPEAKER_09]: changes drastically when you go from
freshly frozen or freshly harvested
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis to dried cannabis and so because
that ratio or yes because that ratio
[SPEAKER_09]: changes the percent terpenes which is the
percent of the volatile terpenes versus
[SPEAKER_09]: everything else that's in there well
remember you're wholesaling a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: water out in there so everything else
that's in there that denominator changes
[SPEAKER_09]: that's why you have to pay attention to
the ratio that alex is talking and and
[SPEAKER_11]: that's a thank you for bringing that up
actually because that that totally
[SPEAKER_11]: triggered my mind right and and so you
know because and and sam that's where i
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of was going to bring up because i
mean you know i think the translation or
[SPEAKER_11]: carryover of like what total terpene
content might have been present you know
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of is totally dependent on you know
all these conditions right like you know
[SPEAKER_11]: time of or temp you know
[SPEAKER_11]: this pictures are being harvested under
means like if it's in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_11]: day versus the middle of the night you
know there's like 20% terpene content off
[SPEAKER_11]: the top just because of the heat of the
sun and the temperatures you're you're
[SPEAKER_11]: harvesting under you know so many people
that harvest commercial cannabis then like
[SPEAKER_11]: how they harvest in the middle of the day
and then they load box trucks up with
[SPEAKER_11]: masses of herb that then kind of sit for
like 45 minutes to hours until they kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of get transported to a place where it can
be put under temperature control
[SPEAKER_11]: conditions you know but in so many ways so
many so what we see because of the
[SPEAKER_11]: volatilization of these you know really
precious mono terpenes you know it's like
[SPEAKER_11]: it kind of is really in my in my opinion
believe it deserves a cold supply chain a
[SPEAKER_11]: continuous cold supply chain anywhere
where it's going to be in the chain of
[SPEAKER_11]: custody of somebody that's caring for the
this perishable good you know and and and
[SPEAKER_11]: in this record year of harvests in
california and overproduction you know i
[SPEAKER_11]: think it's going to be it's very
reminiscent of what happened in oregon a
[SPEAKER_11]: couple years back and what really in a big
way happened is you know one so everything
[SPEAKER_11]: goes to a standstill you know kind of it's
really it really becomes that much more
[SPEAKER_11]: apparent who has infrastructure and who
doesn't have infrastructure to even have
[SPEAKER_11]: you know what is the carrying capacity of
your situation to preserve terpene content
[SPEAKER_11]: what you're holding in your possession
because if you don't have that ability you
[SPEAKER_11]: know then you're kind of going to get like
dusted you know because because in in the
[SPEAKER_11]: time of the great flood you know kind of
the averages of the or the extremes in
[SPEAKER_11]: quality really start dividing because if
the average is about one and a half
[SPEAKER_11]: percent of the state you know everything
sitting around it kind of really goes down
[SPEAKER_11]: to about one percent or less you know so
then if you're at three to five and a half
[SPEAKER_11]: percent you know you're kind of dunking on
holes you know in a big way of just i mean
[SPEAKER_11]: i think it's always that thing if it's
really bomb and it's really terp preserved
[SPEAKER_11]: in this bombing room you know it's always
going to have the ability to fly but if
[SPEAKER_11]: it's anything less than that you know it's
this commoditized cannabinoid race to the
[SPEAKER_11]: bottom game you know so i think it's like
those are the separate kind of sides of
[SPEAKER_11]: the market it's like the commoditized
cannabinoid market and then those that are
[SPEAKER_11]: on the ultra ultra side of you know the
terpene preservation game and you know
[SPEAKER_11]: just being able to immaculately care for
what's in their possession dude you called
[SPEAKER_05]: it with the supply chain needing to be
cold from start to finish when i saw the
[SPEAKER_05]: cryo can come out i thought well that's it
that if the cryo can isn't it something
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly like it needs to be it needs to be
uh be able to be rolled into the fields it
[SPEAKER_05]: needs to be able to you know very quickly
and very cold remove and mitigate 90 or 85
[SPEAKER_05]: percent of that biomass and just preserve
the the glandular trichome heads in which
[SPEAKER_05]: case now that becomes your feed input for
any process you're doing whether you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing co2 extraction or butane extraction
or water extraction you're pouring in
[SPEAKER_05]: resin into your reactors not plant matter
and you've kept it cold since you took it
[SPEAKER_09]: off the field that's my dream yeah i think
that's really in nitrogen hopefully too
[SPEAKER_14]: underground underground containers in
california i mean are the only way you can
[SPEAKER_14]: like do it without using crazy grid you
know issues because anything above ground
[SPEAKER_14]: in california is just subjected to you
know so much heat and so much movement and
[SPEAKER_14]: everything that it's and then you know to
try and put a refrigerator or units on
[SPEAKER_14]: there it just becomes like a wild amount
of electricity and it just and i don't
[SPEAKER_14]: know that that's what we're going for is
like ultimate electricity so there's like
[SPEAKER_14]: this weird balance of like you know trying
to find passive systems to to to flow into
[SPEAKER_14]: these modern needs you know because we do
want the high grade yeah ancient meets
[SPEAKER_11]: future though and that's what's funny is
that old school cats always knew all along
[SPEAKER_11]: you bury your you know it's like i mean
that's all i'm saying how much it's funny
[SPEAKER_11]: how much the old kind of knowledge really
is proving that much more true today you
[SPEAKER_11]: know just around farmers like old wives
tales are in harvest times around the full
[SPEAKER_11]: moon or just like you know times where i
mean they're not harvesting in the middle
[SPEAKER_11]: of the day i mean or i mean just there was
just there's always just there's just so
[SPEAKER_11]: much deep wisdom kind of in a lot of these
older practices that i think now we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting that much more validated yeah and
i just wanted to make the bridge again to
[SPEAKER_01]: the old practices is that all of the
temperatures and the humidities that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody is talking about to preserve
these trichomes and also these plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: herbalism is exactly what the earth's you
know below the earth's surface and
[SPEAKER_01]: geothermal is what it holds constant and
continuous so mother nature has a plan
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a deep understanding she has she
she has a knowing of how to preserve these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and i think that all we have to do
is very easily tap into it rather than try
[SPEAKER_01]: to overthink it so it is and we know that
it's always the basements of our home that
[SPEAKER_01]: have always dried the best flower and made
the best concentrate and consistent
[SPEAKER_14]: temperatures to where the door is not
opening and it's oh it's hot it's cold you
[SPEAKER_14]: know has to be consistent and then you
sometimes will find some herb gets more
[SPEAKER_14]: potent in some cases after you know four
six months of not being opened and whatnot
[SPEAKER_14]: totally big love to mojave richmond in the
house yeah welcome mojave brother hey
[SPEAKER_08]: everyone thanks for uh for the invite
stoked to be here yeah conversation i
[SPEAKER_12]: can't believe you're here mojave i know
sam it's good to see you hey um guys with
[SPEAKER_10]: with the cryo freezing you know i i've
seen a lot of uh hemp flower dried with
[SPEAKER_10]: cryo and it kind of reminds me of cheetos
uh when it's dried um now i i i understand
[SPEAKER_10]: the resin and i think we can we can think
about that in a more methodical way but i
[SPEAKER_10]: i understand where everyone's coming from
we need to preserve things but there is an
[SPEAKER_10]: optimal temperature and range and like the
time that the flower will actually
[SPEAKER_10]: encapsulate some of these these mono
terpenes and and really hold them in and
[SPEAKER_10]: and i think there is a perfect place for
that to happen i just think it's not
[SPEAKER_10]: talked enough about and studied enough as
to when a varietal should and how long it
takes for it to dry and how long it takes
for it to dry and what
[SPEAKER_12]: i found is that if you do a terpene
profile say the top 50 terpenes of uh a
[SPEAKER_12]: fresh skunk number one for example and
then you dry it for two weeks test it
[SPEAKER_12]: again then box it cure it for a month or
so uh test it again and then finally
[SPEAKER_12]: terpene test the resin after it's been
extracted from that same clone but you see
[SPEAKER_12]: a decrease in the profile of mono terpenes
and uh you know the more it's been handled
[SPEAKER_12]: processed and hung around uh the more
volatile ones are gone yep yeah we see
[SPEAKER_11]: that exactly same thing you know and
that's where i really that simple yeah and
[SPEAKER_11]: i think that's where it's so much of the
like uh your long-term preservation that
[SPEAKER_11]: people have in for building out their
business model you know instead of um
[SPEAKER_11]: people kind of you know racing to grow as
much as the neighbor you know being able
[SPEAKER_11]: to just preserve us as the highest
potential and quality you know because you
[SPEAKER_11]: know even yields you know it's like if you
you know harvest and kind of are able to
[SPEAKER_11]: control temperatures you know from the
entirety from you know kind of what time
[SPEAKER_11]: temperatures were being plants were being
harvested under how quickly those plants
[SPEAKER_11]: were able to get below temperature control
conditions how quickly or how long you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of those temperatures able to be
maintained you know because that was one
[SPEAKER_11]: of the big failed kind of uh experiments
around nitrogen packaging you know people
[SPEAKER_11]: with nitrogen pack everybody seemed to
bail on that all at the same time you know
[SPEAKER_11]: but it was a kind of a failed experiment
because everybody nitrogen packaged their
[SPEAKER_11]: herb but then just let it sit in
warehouses you know to like fluctuating
[SPEAKER_11]: day-to-day temperature humidity all these
things you know and a year later sure you
[SPEAKER_11]: all open it up and you know it's bomb but
then it catches up in five minutes you
[SPEAKER_11]: know but there was no there was no
continuity in that you know that
[SPEAKER_11]: temperature humidity you know chain of
custody and so you know i think that one
[SPEAKER_11]: added variable would have actually
probably you know given that technology a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of props and alex like what you're
kind of alluding to is like there is an
[SPEAKER_10]: amount that is too much right that you
write so i think that that's something
[SPEAKER_10]: that's a cold chain event all the way to a
consumer right and that's that's something
[SPEAKER_10]: as this moves forward i'm starting to
think about a whole lot in terms of just
[SPEAKER_10]: resin right but at the same time on the
flip side of it the flower is a super
[SPEAKER_10]: problematic is you know it's just old like
you don't want old you don't want old herb
[SPEAKER_10]: you want fresh herb so what is that time
frame i guess is when i'm asking and and
[SPEAKER_10]: uh you know because i've never really
looked into it i've just kind of you know
[SPEAKER_10]: my bioassay tells me like oh this is this
is fresh this is you're right like there's
[SPEAKER_12]: no beyond that i have looked into it a bit
i've never had pot that i froze for more
[SPEAKER_12]: than a year or two so i can't really speak
on herb but resin heads both cleaned and
[SPEAKER_12]: uncleaned so farmers grade hash it's about
30% thc it's just resin heads but with
[SPEAKER_12]: other uh trash in with it and then there's
a cleaned up resin that's you know in the
[SPEAKER_12]: low 80s and it's just resin heads nothing
else and for a decade frozen minus 30 and
[SPEAKER_12]: you can either flush it with nitrogen or
not and uh it doesn't really change not at
[SPEAKER_10]: all that makes sense to me sam but but now
we we bring in plant you know we bring in
[SPEAKER_10]: a living breathing organism right that's
drying and that it's decaying at a faster
[SPEAKER_10]: rate than the resin to your point so what
is the you know i guess i'm just asking
[SPEAKER_12]: that's why what you think the secret is to
get it to the point of resin i mean that
[SPEAKER_12]: is the active whether it's recreational or
medical or whatever that is what you're
[SPEAKER_12]: after so uh if you if you have any way we
lost you sam at least i did yeah that's
[SPEAKER_05]: why that's why get it as cold as possible
like you said colin we don't want old weed
[SPEAKER_05]: we want fresh weed it's like exactly get
it as fresh as possible do these processes
[SPEAKER_05]: so you preserve everything and then only
then make the decision through your
[SPEAKER_05]: bioassay where you know you have
everything where you enjoy it at different
[SPEAKER_05]: rates and because here's the thing like
someone said earlier oh sometimes there's
[SPEAKER_05]: it's too much yeah too much of a specific
ratio but a different ratio may not be too
[SPEAKER_05]: much so we can't get into these
generalizations of like well i had nine
[SPEAKER_05]: percent terpenes one time and it was way
too much well yeah it might have been
[SPEAKER_05]: super high in delimiting or another
caustic terpene that you know osamine burn
[SPEAKER_05]: a throat or whatever what do you got there
mojave i
[SPEAKER_08]: forgot about them botanical terpenes
non-cannabis derived and when i pulled
[SPEAKER_08]: them out it was pretty far out they were
all the same amount inside each container
[SPEAKER_08]: for the most part and a lot of it
volatilized you know there's definitely
[SPEAKER_08]: it's a gummy kind of resin left over but
some of the tops were completely corroded
[SPEAKER_08]: versus other this is osamine and this is
little old um and all the way across with
[SPEAKER_08]: some of them were just like here's
terpenoline which is a little bit more
[SPEAKER_08]: corroded um here's alpha pining which is
less corroded anyway i just think it's a
[SPEAKER_08]: really interesting conversation about
packaging longevity you know as as our
[SPEAKER_08]: good buddy rob clark always said not all
terpenes are good terpenes that they're i
[SPEAKER_08]: think there is something with fresh weed
that is a little bit i like there's this
[SPEAKER_08]: anthropological concept of cultural
relativism which says like if a culture
[SPEAKER_08]: decides to do something whether it's
batshit crazy or not they did it for a
[SPEAKER_08]: reason and people traditionally really
went through a lot of effort to age
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis and to kind of deterp the flower
before they consumed it and i think that
[SPEAKER_08]: that was you know definitely it was a
different world a different market a
[SPEAKER_08]: different different types of products that
are being consumed but i think it's really
[SPEAKER_08]: interesting i think that there are certain
profiles that improve more with age and
[SPEAKER_08]: certain products that are more stable i've
i've froze flower for geez probably 10
[SPEAKER_08]: years and pulled it out of the freezer and
it's still pretty damn fresh like i've
[SPEAKER_08]: seen stuff that was you know on the market
that was a few months old that had been
[SPEAKER_08]: abused and abused and the turf profile
definitely changes even in the freezer you
[SPEAKER_08]: know it's hard to keep it you know
completely frozen and sealed for that long
[SPEAKER_08]: but i think it's an interesting
conversation like right now california
[SPEAKER_08]: we've got this big glut and all this flour
from last year that no one could sell and
[SPEAKER_08]: it expired and you know they had to you
have to turn it into distillate and get a
[SPEAKER_08]: new coa on it to extend its life and i
think that there's there's no reason why
[SPEAKER_08]: we can't store flour for a long time and i
think that there's you know quite possibly
[SPEAKER_08]: a good reason to not smoke fresh flour for
certain varieties and for certain you know
[SPEAKER_08]: it's it's kind of like the aged wine aged
cheese thing it definitely it changes in a
[SPEAKER_08]: profound way but for some some varieties
i've just noticed you know like these
[SPEAKER_08]: these um you know like high terpenaline
varieties seem to be more stable for
[SPEAKER_08]: instance and that maybe that's just
because the effect of terpenaline on aged
[SPEAKER_08]: flour seems to not diminish as much as
these other higher karyophiline higher
[SPEAKER_08]: mersene varieties and stuff that seem to
like you get no effect after a while or
[SPEAKER_08]: the effect is getting completely
diminished anyway i just think it's an
[SPEAKER_08]: interesting conversation i posted this
thing on on instagram and i rarely do
[SPEAKER_08]: memes and it got a number of people
freaked out like you know you know what's
[SPEAKER_08]: it doing to our packages and it says dude
what's it doing to your throat like when
[SPEAKER_05]: you held that up i was like whoa that's
what my throat looks like when i take a
[SPEAKER_09]: dab of osamine well i've always noticed
that like when you dab is it it's creating
[SPEAKER_09]: a corrosion like what what's well so these
are also pure terpenes right okay well i
[SPEAKER_09]: don't know it it is but most terpenes are
good solvents a lot of those rubbers are
[SPEAKER_09]: are plasticized with things called
plasticizers and a lot of times what
[SPEAKER_09]: happens is the terpene gets into the
rubber leaches out the plasticizer there's
[SPEAKER_09]: plasticizer or nasty compounds or like
di-octyl phthalate and phthalates and shit
[SPEAKER_09]: like that but what you might be seeing
there is just the precipitation of the
[SPEAKER_09]: phthalate plasticizer from the rubber so
what what i mean to say is that it's
[SPEAKER_09]: nothing inherent in the terpene it's just
the terpene interacting with this rubber
[SPEAKER_05]: that's not suited for for but why would
some terpenes react that way the way
[SPEAKER_05]: osamine is reacting and others wouldn't
it's just interesting because osamine is
[SPEAKER_05]: literally one of the harshest turps on the
throat and it looks like it has the most
[SPEAKER_09]: breakdown whatever it's breaking down
solvent for the plasticizer and was able
[SPEAKER_09]: to draw it out or something i i don't know
mark it's weird interesting hey welcome to
[SPEAKER_00]: debbie debbie's in the house good morning
everyone whoa really interesting stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: wander into talking about this uh terpene
plastic interaction didn't know that a
[SPEAKER_05]: little sensory evaluation at uh 955 am
pacific central time pacific standard time
[SPEAKER_09]: mojave can you scrape off like is it like
a powder or a white residue or something
[SPEAKER_09]: or is it is it like you say there's
corrosion like what is the material what
[SPEAKER_08]: does it look like no it is kind of feels
like it's just gummy almost like it
[SPEAKER_08]: precipitated like almost it feels like it
like it passed through the rubber
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah and i can hardly open the containers
oh this one opened yeah it would be
[SPEAKER_09]: interesting to see over a prolonged period
of time if the rubber becomes brittle then
[SPEAKER_09]: that tells you it's leaching out the
plasticizer a rubber without a plasticizer
[SPEAKER_09]: near will turn brittle it'll it'll turn
brittle in a little break well one thing
[SPEAKER_08]: i'm saying if you've ever seen the ball
jars on certain varieties the ball jars
[SPEAKER_08]: the rubber seal on ball jar starts to
crack and i seem to remember this from a
[SPEAKER_08]: tip from i don't know sam i don't know if
i got this from you but this is something
[SPEAKER_08]: way back in amsterdam i think i learned
but was to throw the rubber band in a jar
[SPEAKER_08]: of flour and then pull a month later pull
it out the right variety like the high
[SPEAKER_12]: haze variety uh yes i've seen a melt those
rubber bands easily yeah well and that's
[SPEAKER_11]: the one thing i was going to say real
quick on the test side because we um you
[SPEAKER_11]: know around 2018 we we invested in like a
smoking robot as well so that that could
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of um you know basically pull the
aerosol vape from a vape cartridge that's
[SPEAKER_11]: already been aerosolized and then is
capturing that aerosol and then we're
[SPEAKER_11]: running further testing on it so we're
working with the groups to help in like
[SPEAKER_11]: just long-term shelf life type studies if
they're either using kind of natural kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of derived cannabis terpenes kind of
blended at whatever proportions or ratios
[SPEAKER_11]: um or and or kind of groups that are kind
of just adding these different botanical
[SPEAKER_11]: or otherwise terp uh other type of
terpenes but we we definitely you know i
[SPEAKER_11]: mean we have seen some really interesting
things on the corrosion side of things
[SPEAKER_11]: with like in with with regard to releasing
and increasing high levels of heavy metals
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of over time you know kind of from
cartridges various cartridges i mean
[SPEAKER_11]: there's there's all these unknown
variables about what is actually you know
[SPEAKER_11]: in the hardware that's leading to that but
it's also this combination of okay at what
[SPEAKER_11]: high you know what concentration of
terpene are in these you know if you have
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of 10% limonene in there you know
kind of over time you know is it going to
[SPEAKER_11]: be leading to more corrosion than others
um you know especially with certain types
[SPEAKER_11]: of hardware but these are definitely all
really fascinating questions i think
[SPEAKER_11]: people need to you know just take into
consideration especially if they're
[SPEAKER_09]: formulating products and putting them out
you you might be familiar with amber
[SPEAKER_09]: weiss's study that was recently published
so amber weiss i think is a professor up
[SPEAKER_09]: in up in washington and she studied and uh
uh well published the results of a study
[SPEAKER_09]: of something that you're exactly
addressing which is the leaching of heavy
[SPEAKER_09]: metals in through vape hardware into the
vape cartridge fluid and and what impact
[SPEAKER_09]: that could have on human safety is this
actually putting lead and cadmium and tin
[SPEAKER_09]: and all these other nasty metals because
you've got to think of any shiny metal
[SPEAKER_09]: product most likely coming from the same
factory in china any shiny metal could be
[SPEAKER_09]: contaminated with these other metals which
you probably don't want to have in vape
[SPEAKER_09]: cartridges where you're inhaling this
stuff into your into your lungs and so
[SPEAKER_09]: amber weiss just recently published a
paper maybe what i could do is post the
[SPEAKER_09]: link to it in
[SPEAKER_09]: also brings back you know again the need
to really have not only oversight but the
[SPEAKER_09]: analytical methods like icp and whatnot so
you can look at you know maybe what
[SPEAKER_09]: storing cartridge fluid in these tanks for
prolonged periods of time does in terms of
[SPEAKER_09]: introducing metal content to the fluid
themselves because vape pens aren't going
[SPEAKER_09]: away anytime soon so the real question is
is what's the best way to manufacture that
[SPEAKER_09]: to make sure that not only the thing works
but it works in a way that doesn't leach
[SPEAKER_09]: heavy metals into what you're inhaling
because god knows what the long-term
[SPEAKER_14]: impact of that can be i think not getting
so tricky with everything you know with
[SPEAKER_14]: the old old school apothecaries you know
have have been dealing with essential oils
[SPEAKER_14]: for you know hundreds thousands of years
and they and they also volatize you know
[SPEAKER_14]: and and people have used glass and glass
syringes and glass jars with glass lids
[SPEAKER_14]: and and copper and silver and these metals
are proven to be good for us and gold in
[SPEAKER_14]: some cases you know so we we continue to
get these new products from modernization
[SPEAKER_14]: and then wow we found out they're all
tainted and then now all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_14]: they're well what a shocker you know they
all these new new items coming that are
[SPEAKER_14]: cheap and stuff are now toxic so i think
that we look towards again you know let's
[SPEAKER_14]: not we we this the way we get educated
nowadays is forget about the past and
[SPEAKER_14]: think that we you know we're only learning
now and there's ways that we can build
[SPEAKER_14]: from the past and bring that into our
future packaging and stuff so you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just it's pretty cool if you look at
old school apothecary you know bachas the
[SPEAKER_01]: one the herbs that had the volatile oil in
it that were very aromatic also had each
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those drawers was a glass and they
were kept inside glass and then the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that were less volatile were kept inside
of the wooden drawers so and certain herbs
[SPEAKER_14]: were kept in the basement pretty
interesting that they had to go down into
[SPEAKER_14]: the basement to get it you know depending
on what it was so you know i think it's
[SPEAKER_14]: important for us to just remember that and
also that you know regenerative and
[SPEAKER_14]: organically grown cannabis and earth grown
cannabis tends to keep its its its
[SPEAKER_14]: terpenes longer you know than things that
are aeroponically or or hydroponically
[SPEAKER_14]: grown in some cases maybe alec you you you
could maybe dispute that and i would be
[SPEAKER_14]: open you know but i you find that a lot of
times or that you know the soil grown
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis tends to keep its its flavor has
more integrity in it longer and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine out of it you know and that's
only because of mike more microbiology may
[SPEAKER_01]: be present and i think that that's going
to be the real bridge that you know us as
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farmers and as regenerative
medicine makers are really interested to
[SPEAKER_01]: see the science of you know terpene
secondary metabolites that are profound
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of the plant and then what is
profound inside of the soil and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: profound inside of the plant's endophytic
system and you know its own microbiome so
[SPEAKER_14]: that's and how it affects our our bio and
our brain blood brain barrier and the way
[SPEAKER_06]: that well that's one thing i've been
really really fast you
[SPEAKER_11]: know because with all things equal you
know like you grow the same strain same
[SPEAKER_11]: plant different conditions hydroponically
versus regenerative organic you know like
[SPEAKER_11]: with alain engel's you know soil food web
research and all the stuff she's shown you
[SPEAKER_11]: know whenever you do that side by side
study you can track whenever the
[SPEAKER_11]: microbiome of the soil is balanced to what
the plant wants you know you can track the
[SPEAKER_11]: doubling of the secondary metabolite that
that produces and you see that with
[SPEAKER_11]: lycopene and tomatoes you see that with
various vitamins and berries and you know
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis terpenes are the secondary
metabolite so you know that would go to
[SPEAKER_11]: you know suggest that you know there's the
potential for you know regenerative
[SPEAKER_11]: organic grown you know kind of optimally
organic grown cannabis and potentially
[SPEAKER_11]: being able to produce doubling of the you
know secondary metabolites you know that's
[SPEAKER_11]: like you know there needs you know some
you know a lot of side by side to kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: be able to demonstrate but that that but
that's really fascinating to me because
[SPEAKER_11]: you know from you know there's everything
you could do as a farmer to grow the plant
[SPEAKER_11]: most optimally and then from that point on
then it's okay then it's all about you
[SPEAKER_11]: know post harvest handling temperatures
all these things that you do to kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: lock in and preserve like you know what
you were able to kind of produce you know
[SPEAKER_11]: and everything's working against you you
know kind of if you're working with you
[SPEAKER_11]: know harvesting in higher temperatures
versus you know because we've seen groups
[SPEAKER_11]: that will kind of you know harvest you
know kind of fresh frozen material in the
[SPEAKER_11]: field you know in the middle of the day
kind of an 80 plus degree temperatures and
[SPEAKER_11]: then you know do the same thing at in the
middle of the night you know zombie
[SPEAKER_11]: harvest and kind of do that and track kind
of the you know resin essential oil return
[SPEAKER_11]: off the off the extract yield and you see
substantial kind of difference you know 20
[SPEAKER_11]: plus percent you know ish you know up to
20 percent or more kind of turpentine loss
[SPEAKER_11]: just not you know kind of decision of
harvest time so here's a question here's a
[SPEAKER_05]: question some of the terpiest and most
ridiculous hash i've ever made in my life
[SPEAKER_05]: has been in jamaica where it's like
literally like 100 degrees in the field i
[SPEAKER_05]: can't even go in the field for more than
like 20 or 30 minutes at a time or my
[SPEAKER_05]: pasty white ass just turns lobster red and
then then i can't you know enjoy myself
[SPEAKER_05]: anymore so i'm like going in and out of
the field every 15 to 20 minutes and and
[SPEAKER_05]: i'm just looking at these plants and
they're so stinky and the field is so
[SPEAKER_05]: stinky and i'm just thinking like holy
shit like these things are off gassing an
[SPEAKER_05]: insane amount of terpenes right now is it
because of that process that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: producing more because at the end of it
when i like harvest when we harvested that
[SPEAKER_05]: shit and then ran it through the bags and
trust me we were not keeping it cold all
[SPEAKER_05]: the way to till they got into the bags
they just they were in like warm plastic
[SPEAKER_05]: bags or whatever it was so terpy and i
mean dude sam even you can acknowledge
[SPEAKER_05]: because this was at a time where this was
the first time sam ever smoked anything i
[SPEAKER_05]: had okay prior to that because we were in
jamaica together prior to that he only
[SPEAKER_05]: smoked his own shit like it just it was it
was that good and i i'm not like saying
[SPEAKER_05]: that he shouldn't have because truly like
that shit was from another planet but this
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff in jamaica was like i want to say it
was almost on point wouldn't you agree sam
[SPEAKER_12]: do you remember the stuff we made well
there was two points number one i didn't
[SPEAKER_12]: have enough to keep smoking just mine so
but number two the stuff we made was
[SPEAKER_12]: outrageously good agreed it was really
good i still have pictures of it no it was
[SPEAKER_12]: really it was also a darker redder color
than the stuff grown in my greenhouse for
[SPEAKER_10]: example so i i you know marcus i have some
thoughts on that i mean you know alex was
[SPEAKER_10]: bringing up like biotransformation through
enzymatic uptake and all these things that
[SPEAKER_10]: can happen through you know target
feedings and kind of you know there's
[SPEAKER_10]: there's the term you know uh just driving
crop crop steering right but you can do
[SPEAKER_10]: crop steering with in many different ways
and that's just an ideology and then
[SPEAKER_10]: there's the stress responses right you
have stress response that plants giving
[SPEAKER_10]: off and combating the environment that's
in in most cases that is going to directly
[SPEAKER_10]: result in the resin and that could go good
or that could go both sides right you
[SPEAKER_10]: could have a response that stresses the
plant not so bad that it just like goes
[SPEAKER_10]: the wrong direction or it's stressed
response in the right direction and it
[SPEAKER_10]: allows it to express a profile that it
hasn't really expressed before and i've
[SPEAKER_10]: seen that firsthand over the years a lot
so you know i think there's there's two
[SPEAKER_10]: ways to go about about this and there's
two ideologies here but they all kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: end up the same place if you do the right
things so that i think there's there's
[SPEAKER_10]: that to think about so i don't know if
anyone has any thoughts on that as well
[SPEAKER_10]: but i think that's you know from my
experience targeting and then also going
[SPEAKER_10]: the other way and stressing them out you
get some equally amazing results yeah i
[SPEAKER_11]: think i agree with that and you know one
thing i'd say too is you know kind of uh
[SPEAKER_11]: marcus to the point you were just bringing
up you know i mean certain strains
[SPEAKER_11]: genetics have the potential to put out
certain amounts you know just inherently
[SPEAKER_11]: like before the you know optimal feeding
and you know kind of cultivation side of
[SPEAKER_11]: things happen you know i mean you could
have certain strains that sure are really
[SPEAKER_11]: really high in cannabinoid content but
they might not ever have the potential put
[SPEAKER_11]: out more than two to three percent terpene
content in the dried flower you know as
[SPEAKER_11]: opposed to other kind of strains that
might be you know lower overall in
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoid content or or overall thc but
you know might you know kind of be able to
[SPEAKER_11]: readily pump out five plus potential
percent you know and that's where i'm
[SPEAKER_11]: really fascinated too about um what colin
was just bringing up you know i think
[SPEAKER_11]: there's all these you know like uh i don't
know it's hormesis environmental hormesis
[SPEAKER_11]: or something but it's just like the the
plant's ability to kind of adapt um to the
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of given you know kind of stress
responses that that environment is growing
[SPEAKER_11]: and provides you know um and so you know i
think there's all these different
[SPEAKER_11]: fascinating things to track but and then
you know but you know but you know all
[SPEAKER_11]: things given you know each unique cultivar
has its potential of what it can put out
[SPEAKER_11]: and you know who knows maybe the potential
or the that's might be different
[SPEAKER_11]: environments across the world where it
might be more optimally you know uh able
[SPEAKER_11]: to be expressed in certain areas but all
things considered you know strain has the
[SPEAKER_11]: potential you know to put out a certain
amount and then like i think there's the
[SPEAKER_11]: future study to understand okay well if
it's you know one-to-one soil you know
[SPEAKER_11]: fungal bacterial ratio and microbes in the
soil and kind of optimally kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: regenerate or generally grown versus
hydroponic you know can it can there be
[SPEAKER_11]: this increase or doubling of secondary
metabolites you know because then from
[SPEAKER_11]: there it's okay the the plant is able to
produce its potential you know maybe
[SPEAKER_11]: through cultivation methods it can be met
drastically doubled or increased versus
[SPEAKER_11]: not but then from that point it's like
post-harvest handling is where kind of you
[SPEAKER_11]: know we see 60 to 80 percent of the like
devaluation or you know kind of step you
[SPEAKER_11]: know and then that's what just what's
really fascinating to see you know when
[SPEAKER_11]: we've been on kind of a bit of a not
public service announcement like sometimes
[SPEAKER_11]: it's like chicken little uh but not
screaming about the sky's falling but
[SPEAKER_11]: about the turps are volatilizing you know
and you know trying to kind of help just
[SPEAKER_11]: empower those who work with them this
understanding of how how like how much
[SPEAKER_11]: they need to vet their their supply chain
partners because they could be putting the
[SPEAKER_11]: most premium bomb herb forward you know
that they preserved five percent terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: content in it but then the time it gets
the distributor sits around a month before
[SPEAKER_11]: it goes to be packaged you know processed
put into jars and then driven in
[SPEAKER_11]: non-frigerated kind of transportation to a
dispensary well now it's at the dispensary
[SPEAKER_11]: getting rejected because it might have
like 70 less terpene content and now now
[SPEAKER_11]: the distributor is going back to the
farmer to try to renegotiate price you
[SPEAKER_05]: know and if it's not going if it's if it's
not getting sent back it's going into a
[SPEAKER_11]: non-cooled vault yeah exactly and i think
in the future i think the farmers and the
[SPEAKER_11]: end consumers are going to be most
outraged by how lacking you know because
[SPEAKER_11]: people are paying paying premium prices
for like you know top-shelf quality herb
[SPEAKER_11]: but if you actually look at it you know on
the you know kind of phytochemical
[SPEAKER_11]: standpoint it's like you know 60 70
percent less actually bomb than when it
[SPEAKER_11]: was uh able to be preserved yeah and what
does that do what does that do to not bomb
[SPEAKER_05]: herb the stuff that the majority of people
are actually growing how about that now
[SPEAKER_05]: now put that into that non-cooled supply
chain and you end up with be way below
[SPEAKER_11]: mediocre welcome etienne like that's not a
good place to compete in right now you
[SPEAKER_01]: know really quickly i just wanted to bring
up um just the definition of secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites it has the word metabolism in
it so when we're talking about secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites we're actually talking about
the metabolism of the plant and when we
[SPEAKER_01]: compare the metabolism of a human being in
warm weather or warm climates or we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually look at the metabolism of soil
when we have year-round warmth we have
[SPEAKER_01]: very high metabolism rates the soil is
constantly metabolizing we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous amounts of microbiology that's
tremendously metabolizing so the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: endophytic system of the plant is going to
be at a much higher rate a much higher
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism and those people understand who
are coming from the north where it isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: sunny all of the time that we have slower
metabolism in our soil we have slower
[SPEAKER_01]: growth cycles and when we go to the warm
weather our metabolism kicks up and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people say hey i actually lost a lot of
weight when i went to warmer weather well
[SPEAKER_01]: that reaction is your metabolism which is
your microbiome so of course we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have higher secondary metabolites
because when we go to warmer weather where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's warm year round and sunny year round
we're going to have continuous
[SPEAKER_11]: metabolizing so i just wanted to add that
damn nailed it that's awesome thank you
[SPEAKER_12]: alex what was the highest content that you
guys found um we we see in a very small
[SPEAKER_11]: percentage of the data for dried flower
three to five and a half percent is really
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of the the range in that really
unique subset of data you know again about
[SPEAKER_11]: one and a half percent is the average of
everything we tested you know three to
[SPEAKER_11]: five and a half percent is this in this
other league we see in the data this like
[SPEAKER_12]: really high percentile of dried flower i'm
pretty sure that uh the folks at napro
[SPEAKER_12]: showed me something that was eight or ten
she uses i've definitely had that
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation with mark as well no i didn't
see it but he was like yeah yeah eight
[SPEAKER_05]: eight to ten i was eight to ten i i would
want to concentrate that is that other
[SPEAKER_17]: dried plant material dried plant material
wow right ele quick question for you and
[SPEAKER_17]: i'm happy to see you hey good to see you
here um what about the difference in the
[SPEAKER_17]: terpene profiles of trikes and rosin do
you see much difference um i was i mean i
[SPEAKER_11]: i don't think i'd have i'd be able to
really speak to uh i mean because we see
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of um concentrates across you know
not what i haven't been able to see kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of the divide in kind of types you know
because like a lot of people you know
[SPEAKER_11]: submit us just a name you know of the
strain not kind of differentiating what
[SPEAKER_11]: type of kind of extraction it is um but we
see it we see that at embark because we
[SPEAKER_05]: get when we buy if we buy if we make
flower rosin for instance we'll get a coa
[SPEAKER_05]: from the flower before we can bring it
into our facility oh i froze
[SPEAKER_11]: an amount of heat for an amount of time
there is going to be an amount of
[SPEAKER_11]: volatilization that happens um you know
but so each each step through kind of you
[SPEAKER_11]: know the the process of whether you're
doing solvent list or kind of solvent you
[SPEAKER_11]: know there's all these things internally
best practices that can be done to kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: just try to optimize or minimize uh
optimize kind of preservation or minimize
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of loss um but but yeah i would know
much more about that marcus you had froze
[SPEAKER_05]: up you you're back yeah i'm not sure if
i'm gonna end up freezing up again but at
[SPEAKER_05]: embark we have to get coas for the flower
then we make the bubble we have to get a
[SPEAKER_05]: coa for the bubble if we want to make the
rosin then we'll get a coa for the rosin
[SPEAKER_05]: so we have seen we've seen all sorts of
different things from cultivating
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivars that change very little to
cultivars that change a lot and that
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes that weren't there in the
beginning are there in the end especially
[SPEAKER_05]: from like non-rosin to rosin heating them
up i guess changes them uh in in ways but
[SPEAKER_05]: um yeah nothing that's been shocking one
thing i would say to that real quick what
[SPEAKER_11]: you were just mentioning marcus and you
know uh i might have mentioned this before
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of on hash church but um you know
from what we see you know kind of in the
[SPEAKER_11]: in the you know ranking of most present to
least present and you know that over 40
[SPEAKER_11]: terpenes we're we're actively testing for
every time we do a test um you know really
[SPEAKER_11]: it's these five to six primary mono
terpenes you know then there's a few
[SPEAKER_11]: sesquiterpene like beta-carotene and
humulene um you know um you know some some
[SPEAKER_11]: of these other um type compounds um but
but you know essentially what we see is
[SPEAKER_11]: you know in the total potential of the
plant whenever it's ripe or kind of not
[SPEAKER_11]: nothing's volatilized you know kind of
it'll show in the rank order these mono
[SPEAKER_11]: terpenes sesquiterpene's you know on but
but whenever all the primary mono terpenes
[SPEAKER_11]: boil off as well as the sesquiterpene's
boil off you know we see that you know
[SPEAKER_11]: they're basically there's a concentration
of these really small present terpenes
[SPEAKER_11]: that were there that are all of a sudden
the the primary things on the on the
[SPEAKER_11]: profile you know and they're the higher
boiling point terpenes and in an ol like
[SPEAKER_11]: neurolytol visibleol guaiol phytol you
know and so these profile these terpenes
[SPEAKER_11]: became become the profile whenever there's
an absence of the primary compounds that
[SPEAKER_09]: are now gone well those are all terpenoids
right they're not terpenes anymore sure
[SPEAKER_11]: sure yeah yeah yeah yeah i appreciate that
yeah they're like higher alcohol kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: base type compounds right or and you know
and so but but we we deem this this
[SPEAKER_11]: artifact kind of terpene profile as the
schwat we call it the schwag flag and the
[SPEAKER_11]: schwag flag is essentially anytime that
there's you know like about 0.75 percent
[SPEAKER_11]: total terpene content or less and all the
mono sesquiterpene's are gone and the only
[SPEAKER_11]: terpenes that remain in the profile like
visibleol neurolytol guaiol phytol that's
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty much the artifact like the schwag
and the hay smell from what we can gather
[SPEAKER_05]: that's wild dude that's wild that is
absolutely is that that is that what what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're testing due to the anaerobic
decomposition that's happening whatever
[SPEAKER_11]: the cannabis is put in is right yeah it's
it's the it's it's the artifact of uh pro
[SPEAKER_11]: it's an artifact terpene profile that
remains whenever you know the the lacking
[SPEAKER_11]: uh kind of prep or the lacking quality and
kind of how it was dried and cured stored
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of you know is you know it's it yeah
it's what you know whenever it goes flat
[SPEAKER_11]: everything else is boiled off and
volatileized kind of those kind of very
[SPEAKER_11]: repeatedly stay behind and now and how we
kind of came across that is we had this
[SPEAKER_11]: outlier flag you know that you know
anytime there was a unique terpene profile
[SPEAKER_06]: that didn't kind of that we we see with
really high accuracy predictability here
[SPEAKER_11]: when you get flagging first going through
all that data and it's really really
[SPEAKER_11]: fascinating going through all the data
because i was like oh these are where all
[SPEAKER_11]: the really unique land race like super
rare profiles are going to be and i'll be
[SPEAKER_11]: it though there was you know very unique
rare amounts of profiles in there there
[SPEAKER_11]: was a very small amount of the data and a
vast majority of the data in that outlying
[SPEAKER_11]: data set was this artifact of schwag and
you just see it so repeatedly across
[SPEAKER_11]: thousands of samples you know you're like
oh yeah that's for sure what that is so
[SPEAKER_03]: you literally have a profile for a
cannabis corpse yeah total that what not
[SPEAKER_09]: to do but anecdotally i have a story where
a friend of mine resurrected some seeds
[SPEAKER_09]: that his parents took away from him like
30 years ago and he found them after his
[SPEAKER_09]: his dad had passed away because they were
going through his stuff and he found this
[SPEAKER_09]: old bag of weed that his dad had took from
like 30 years ago so he popped some of
[SPEAKER_09]: these beans and yeah it was actually a
panama red variety and this older cat that
[SPEAKER_09]: we hang out with who doesn't really like
[SPEAKER_09]: you know back in the 70s and 80s before
grateful dead tour brought kind bud from
[SPEAKER_09]: norcal across the country so um i think
there is something to that to that profile
[SPEAKER_09]: that you were talking about alec that that
um uh what the mostly most of those
[SPEAKER_09]: compounds again are terpene alcohol so
again maybe there was something about the
[SPEAKER_09]: aging of that and maybe again about the
way that you know cannabis back in the 70s
[SPEAKER_09]: and 80s were smuggled up from mexico or
wherever up into you know where we lived
[SPEAKER_09]: in in in northeast and some way that
flavor that essence that flag flag you're
[SPEAKER_09]: talking about took this guy right back to
the 60s oh man that's how we used to taste
[SPEAKER_00]: you know he loved it i don't miss the
taste of dirt remember when all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis just actually tasted like dirt
that was crazy or like mold right yeah
[SPEAKER_09]: exactly with with hints of diesel fuel
right because sometimes it was packed in
[SPEAKER_09]: in cartons inside gas tanks right
occasionally and you prepare a clot yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: you know when talking when talking about
these terpene profiles that repeat over
[SPEAKER_05]: and over again that alec was mentioning i
just wonder how much the impact of
[SPEAKER_05]: prohibition and the mentality of how much
can i get and how fast can i get it
[SPEAKER_05]: bottlenecked us into these particular
dominant terpenes what do you guys have to
[SPEAKER_03]: think about that well i mean it's also
been subjective of the farmer himself or
[SPEAKER_03]: herself because even sam has stated time
and time again how he selected certain
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotypes based on the flavor profiles
that he liked specifically so there's also
[SPEAKER_03]: other types of genetics that were also
lost due to our propagators who are
[SPEAKER_03]: actually perpetuating the genetics based
on what they liked also based off of the
[SPEAKER_03]: growing environments that they were
successful in they were so much more rare
[SPEAKER_05]: than the how much can i get and how fast
can i get it crowd though consuming large
[SPEAKER_08]: amounts you know if you think about the
volume that they're smoking in a big giant
[SPEAKER_08]: cone or a big giant ball of hash so the
terpene to cannabinoid ratios were you
[SPEAKER_08]: know completely different than what you're
getting in a joint right and maybe that
[SPEAKER_08]: had to do with one of the reasons why they
were kind of actively seeking to
[SPEAKER_08]: volatilize a lot of those mono turps was
because they were going to get a certain
[SPEAKER_08]: volume in there and then they're going to
even higher because they had extra thc so
[SPEAKER_08]: it's i think it's a really interesting
question and and why they selected those
[SPEAKER_08]: varieties for their own particular you
know their own particular needs versus why
[SPEAKER_12]: we select varieties for the market if you
look at several hundred years ago mojave
[SPEAKER_12]: they were selecting just by smoking and
saving the seeds of the varieties that got
[SPEAKER_12]: them the highest or they like the effects
or the taste or the smell of and they were
[SPEAKER_12]: incredibly successful actually if you
think about it all kinds of recreational
[SPEAKER_12]: varieties are really just thc only until
the cbd craze started it was really common
[SPEAKER_12]: to find thc only varieties especially in
equatorial tropical varieties it was
[SPEAKER_11]: really extremely common you know it's it's
fascinating to kind of you know think
[SPEAKER_11]: about the ancient practices and selection
and how you know kind of how much i guess
[SPEAKER_11]: brilliance of there there was kind of
through the plant that was cultivated by
[SPEAKER_11]: the people you know and then so much was
lost in a lot of ways from the global kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of prohibition against this plan
persecution against this plant and kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: paraquatting and kind of just uh you know
i'm really curious on you know what that
[SPEAKER_11]: those eradication efforts did to you know
the the rarity kind of of cannabis certain
[SPEAKER_11]: profiles that might have kind of been lost
forever that you know could have
[SPEAKER_11]: potentially provided medicine for the
future of you know needs that we don't
[SPEAKER_11]: even know we need yet you know and so it's
really crazy to see how much that
[SPEAKER_12]: prohibition and kind of uh you know to be
honest alex to be truly honest i think
[SPEAKER_12]: we've lost more by do be types who think
they're doing a favor by taking equatorial
[SPEAKER_12]: seeds to afghanistan or afghani genetics
to tropical equatorial areas although
[SPEAKER_11]: neither one of them can be any good right
well and i guess i guess it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_11]: planting like eucalyptus and random areas
and it becoming an invasive species kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of thing is that what you're saying it's
painting the gene pools of the uniques now
[SPEAKER_06]: because then
[SPEAKER_12]: both to share it with the government there
the the same government for the last 50
[SPEAKER_12]: years have been prosecuting cannabis
growers and destroying cannabis so i mean
[SPEAKER_12]: what is the world i really don't know
anymore and i think that that really could
[SPEAKER_01]: be bringing in the conversation of like
what's invasive and what's being traveled
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you know like there's certain
areas and region species because a bird
[SPEAKER_01]: brought it there and because the soil and
the area and the environment were perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: and because the nature called that
particular plant to that area and zone and
[SPEAKER_01]: it just so happens that a lot of the
hippie types from the 60s and 70s that
[SPEAKER_01]: were trading the seeds were the ones that
were traveling and humans have always
[SPEAKER_01]: traveled and we've always had
relationships with seeds and especially
[SPEAKER_01]: especially with psychoactive plants so
whenever something sparks us then of
[SPEAKER_01]: course we want to share it it's part of
our collective consciousness as human
[SPEAKER_01]: beings so i think it would be hard to say
just the hippie types if we look at all of
[SPEAKER_01]: humanity because then we're looking at the
cannabis plant having changed multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: times into multiple different facets for
multiple different reasons that are
[SPEAKER_01]: unbeknownst to us because it wasn't even
scribed at that time so i think just to
[SPEAKER_01]: pick aside just one particular generation
of the plant really isn't giving the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: its full volume and understanding of its
full potential i appreciate that kelly i'm
[SPEAKER_11]: just real quick i just wanted to say i
really appreciate that and i was going to
[SPEAKER_11]: say god bless cancer canna for bringing
the iola stavine benisteriopsis capii to
[SPEAKER_11]: hawaii and how much that that plant loves
growing in that environment and how much
[SPEAKER_11]: it's now really helping in the kind of
global kind of replanting and kind of you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of just the idea of sustainably
how we kind of were able to grow these
[SPEAKER_11]: plants you know without depleting you know
various regions of the world and the
[SPEAKER_11]: amazon but just from a biocultural
conservational effort you know how you
[SPEAKER_11]: know yeah i appreciate that perspective
well i think you know we're stewards of
[SPEAKER_08]: the plants you know helping the plant
spread it's it's maybe sorry i just say
[SPEAKER_08]: it's maybe not it's not the hippies it's
what the other thing sam mentioned it's
[SPEAKER_12]: the airplanes we can blame it on the
airplanes and airplanes right and also i'm
[SPEAKER_12]: not sure cannabis is 400 million years old
i mean it may be it's possible but uh
[SPEAKER_12]: receptors are scientific proof for that
400 million year old the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: system is older than the endocannabinoid
system came before the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_08]: right but another point i just wanted to
make on this whole hybridization is that
[SPEAKER_08]: um it's the natural evolution of organisms
to want to spread themselves and disperse
[SPEAKER_08]: themselves as far as as they can to be as
successful and but at the same time it's
[SPEAKER_08]: the isolation that creates diversity you
know they have this right and you want to
[SPEAKER_12]: try to preserve that diversity if possible
exactly there's a really great movie or
[SPEAKER_08]: documentary and book called the um the
journey of man about 10 years ago or so
[SPEAKER_08]: and it was about collecting you know the
the data on the human genome and the the
[SPEAKER_08]: point that was really interesting at the
end of this documentary they they kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: you know they they went around the world
and they found all these points where
[SPEAKER_08]: where um human populations would diverge
and and and um come together and they they
[SPEAKER_08]: they literally found the story of how our
genetics moved around the earth right we
[SPEAKER_08]: now know that we know we came from africa
into central asia europe blah blah blah
[SPEAKER_08]: north america but they couldn't have
gotten that data any later than when they
[SPEAKER_08]: did because all those populations had all
blended and there was no original pockets
[SPEAKER_08]: of all these different um genes and and
that's what happened with cannabis you
[SPEAKER_08]: know we we spread out but then all of a
sudden we spread out and we we isolated
[SPEAKER_08]: and became um unique but then we all
blended up again you know and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: like the best examples of that is mexico
jamaica and morocco there are no land
[SPEAKER_09]: races left in the dogs right dogs we have
we have all these mutts in the world right
[SPEAKER_12]: running around right right but it's nice
to have afghans and chihuahuas yeah and
[SPEAKER_08]: it's important to think about for culture
and for just uh you know diversity in our
[SPEAKER_08]: own biology how important it was for us to
stay separate for so long before we
[SPEAKER_08]: started blending you know and the blending
part is kind of inevitable because of the
[SPEAKER_08]: airplanes and because of the way our
culture is connected and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_14]: but are we ever separate if we were
supposedly all from africa
[SPEAKER_14]: back together and now we're mixing again
because evolution needs it i think it
[SPEAKER_14]: doesn't work to be isolated that's the
whole entire point of isolation like
[SPEAKER_14]: isolation is not life even in the case of
well i mean i you know cultures living in
[SPEAKER_14]: certain areas for thousands of years
obviously that's successful and beautiful
[SPEAKER_14]: but then you know modernization happens
people travel they move the world changes
[SPEAKER_14]: so i think that you know bringing right
now we're at a point of you know needing
[SPEAKER_14]: biodiversity and cultural poly culture and
you know i guaranteed a bunch of the
[SPEAKER_14]: afghanistan families that came over you
know in this last flux probably have maybe
[SPEAKER_14]: some ganja seeds on them and you know what
i wouldn't say we're mad about it like you
[SPEAKER_12]: know probably the neanderthal people would
agree with you well i don't know you know
[SPEAKER_01]: i think that i think that the intuition
here is that we are trying to explain
[SPEAKER_01]: something that a plant has been doing so
we are trying to take this human idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: what is best for the plant through our own
experiences of what is best for the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just very interesting of our
explanations of natural science and what
[SPEAKER_01]: we think is best in our own relationship
with this plant and that's really what it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes down to because so many of us have
these different relationships with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant whether it be only science or
whether it be only nature and it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: this human brain expansion that is us
trying to explain it in our language so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can have a good experience with it
so we can propagate it so we can have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good experience with it and it's all just
really interesting and i just wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: say that all of it is so incredibly valid
because our brain is like the filtration
[SPEAKER_01]: system of how it's all going to be spit
out and how we're all going to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: this great microcosm of uh nature
basically and how it interacts with that
[SPEAKER_12]: i'm definitely in favor of saving
biodiversity both in plants animals people
[SPEAKER_12]: i mean i i can think of nothing more
boring than us all being the same there's
[SPEAKER_12]: even a song i think it goes wouldn't it be
real drag if we were all the same dude now
[SPEAKER_05]: that's an episode where both skunk man sam
and i have sung you don't get that every
[SPEAKER_05]: hash charge i also have one other thing to
say um shout out to terrence mckenna i
[SPEAKER_05]: heard uh alex drop his name earlier i was
in the other room cutting my kids some
[SPEAKER_05]: apples and cucumbers but it was just uh
terrence's would have just been terrence's
[SPEAKER_05]: 75th birthday on november 16th uh huge
inspiration in my life you know like
[SPEAKER_05]: really set me off on a path and i always
drop this whenever terrence's name gets
[SPEAKER_05]: brought up my all-time favorite lecture by
him uh is called psilocybin in the sands
[SPEAKER_05]: of time i'll put it into the description
link so uh anyone that wants to go check
[SPEAKER_11]: that out can it is uh a doozy oh i i was
hoping to get a screenshot of that picture
[SPEAKER_11]: you shared i'll send it to you bro thank
you that's really rad i appreciate that
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know i wanted to say something to
uh sam you're saying that you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all the same i think that it's
pretty interesting just a little fact is
[SPEAKER_01]: that when you look at our dna we're like
99.9 percent all the same but when you
[SPEAKER_01]: look at our microbiome we're 99.9 percent
different so i think as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology is going to be alive on the
planet there's always going to be you know
[SPEAKER_12]: incredible amounts of diversity and i
agree viva la difference viva la
[SPEAKER_17]: difference hey if you all allow me i would
like to just shine a light on the subject
[SPEAKER_17]: that is the passing of antonio escorotado
i don't know if you all know who he is but
[SPEAKER_17]: he was one of my favorite drug researchers
he wrote the history of the the general
[SPEAKER_17]: history of drugs he was a philosopher a
spanish philosopher and he just passed
[SPEAKER_17]: away i just read the news he was 80 so if
you could all just like send some love to
[SPEAKER_17]: him he was one of the people and when i
read his book that i realized that i
[SPEAKER_17]: wanted to study drugs i'm not kidding so
if you could just share some love to the
[SPEAKER_17]: guy he was one of the first well-known
anti-prohibitionists that really spread
[SPEAKER_17]: words about it all right thank you for
that what was his name again he wrote a
[SPEAKER_17]: book on the 80s and 70s about the general
history of drugs like i remember that i
[SPEAKER_17]: used a bunch of in my thesis and it's very
nice like it's very nice to read it like
[SPEAKER_17]: it's a very good flow of on all the
substances and definitely he did one of
[SPEAKER_17]: the biggest publications on
anti-prohibitionism so he was he was a
[SPEAKER_17]: real fighter and he passed away with 80
today so we're very thankful for his
[SPEAKER_17]: existence i'm sure that without him a
bunch of other people wouldn't have been
[SPEAKER_03]: fighting against prohibitionism or our
condolences as a collective to the great
[SPEAKER_03]: and hard work that they do and perpetuate
much love and great respect yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely i raise my pipe to all the
fallen soldiers and uh all the ones that
[SPEAKER_05]: are still here it is this someone just
mentioned someone just mentioned in chat
[SPEAKER_05]: these these churches episodes is how
wisdom can propagate i do love when you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys share you know any type of drug you
know drop the people of the names of the
[SPEAKER_05]: people that have inspired you books that
have inspired you it's just a great source
[SPEAKER_05]: of information for people and sorry
whoever was about to go can speak now all
[SPEAKER_14]: good all good i was wondering what
varietals uh you will be bringing down
[SPEAKER_14]: that you really liked this year of flin
and alice to the legends of hash and also
[SPEAKER_14]: i was wondering what you thought about the
five degree shelf temp on the freeze dryer
[SPEAKER_14]: and if you guys have gone for that or or
have you seen flint talk about the freezer
[SPEAKER_02]: no i don't usually go that low on the
freezer i don't know i like to keep my
[SPEAKER_02]: cycles so that they're done in like about
24 hours because usually we got more trays
[SPEAKER_05]: to put in there and how much can you max
out on a freeze dryer like that in 24
[SPEAKER_05]: hours what will you pull out of the freeze
dryer in total with weight i mean it
[SPEAKER_02]: depends on the freeze dryer like the excel
pharmaceuticals actually take a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: longer than 24 hours sometimes they're a
little bit more like 30 but uh usually you
[SPEAKER_02]: can get like eight to 1200 grams in there
pretty well and get it all dry kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: depends on the strain though too if you're
going to get it dry in that amount of time
[SPEAKER_02]: some things take a bit longer or if you
don't load it perfectly and you get a
[SPEAKER_02]: little thickness in one corner because
your trays aren't even on the thing or
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not level and then it takes longer
to all that type of stuff i always found i
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't get much more than a kilo into
those freeze dryers lab conco a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: more but lab conco is not really a freeze
dryer you want to leave overnight because
[SPEAKER_05]: once it cycles it dries much much faster
than the other ones but it doesn't hold a
[SPEAKER_05]: cold temperature like harvest rights and
freeze dry co's and you know those other
[SPEAKER_05]: those other units it's an interesting game
the freeze dryer game because i thought
[SPEAKER_05]: initially i wanted big freeze dryers and
then i realized no i want to be specific
[SPEAKER_05]: to cultivars the regulations in canada i
can't mix cultivars i could never wash two
[SPEAKER_05]: different things and put them in the same
freeze dryer so suddenly it became really
[SPEAKER_05]: not that valuable of having a giant mill
rock freeze dryer that i could fit 50
[SPEAKER_05]: kilos of bubble into because i'm not going
to be making 50 kilos of any one variety
[SPEAKER_05]: any anytime soon so it's kind of what i
found at home we never ever feel the whole
[SPEAKER_17]: fridge i feel like it at least because
what we wash in the house is different
[SPEAKER_02]: than like in a i've been humble when we
wash like 15 to in a day we'll wash 45
[SPEAKER_02]: kilos of wet material so that ends up that
makes sense on a you know three to five
[SPEAKER_05]: percent yield so yeah yeah we do the same
thing with i mean we're getting now into
[SPEAKER_05]: for uh fresh frozen but the same
equivalent of amount of of cured and dried
[SPEAKER_05]: flour which would probably be you know
eight or nine and josh that's about the
[SPEAKER_16]: variety we're taking down i don't know i
don't know if we can speak about it can we
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah i don't know i guess how do they say
we can i mean i think we're okay okay that
[SPEAKER_02]: makes sense i'm not sure can we i'll tell
you one thing we're definitely not
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing rosin and anyone who does hey
you're gonna hear from me i'll tell you
[SPEAKER_15]: that we make fun of it because it's
legends of hash right i'm like it's funny
[SPEAKER_15]: when people bring rosin to the legends of
hash it's better well you know what we
[SPEAKER_05]: just have to create division no matter how
good and anything is we have to create
[SPEAKER_05]: division we're human beings it's
impossible not to do and so if we didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: if we didn't build a fence and then look
over and be like your grass is different
[SPEAKER_05]: than my grass we wouldn't be human beings
that's true that's true it's all in good
[SPEAKER_05]: fun oh yeah trust me it's not it actually
gets violent and insane and some people
[SPEAKER_05]: have made it their mission to make that a
big deal like believe it or not there's
[SPEAKER_05]: there's some people that are absolutely
not just in good fun they're actually
[SPEAKER_05]: upset and and borderline uh raging uh
karen style no offense to anyone we are
[SPEAKER_17]: here making jokes not being serious no no
i i get the bet i get all the behind the
[SPEAKER_05]: scenes stuff so i can let you know that
that particular joke has more depth than
[SPEAKER_05]: you may know uh to to it i'm just letting
you know i personally what i said to
[SPEAKER_05]: adison when he was telling me about a
couple of people who are quite upset about
[SPEAKER_05]: it uh because they you know people love to
think they know what legends of hash is
[SPEAKER_05]: about but there's only two people in this
room that actually founded the legends of
[SPEAKER_05]: hash dinner so there's really only two
people that know what it's about and it
[SPEAKER_05]: can be about whatever we want it to be
about because it's our event and we'll
[SPEAKER_05]: miss you you won't be there well i'll be
there on video only and i'm hoping sam's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to appear as well well at least uh
uh sam i am there yeah we're so sad that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to be down too and i just
wanted to say like because you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: the word division was brought up and i
felt like it was an opportunity to jump in
[SPEAKER_01]: and i felt like if we're going to be
bringing uh you know the word cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: into this and we're going to be partaking
in cannabis and you know we talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: poly culture and we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: with this plant minute medicine to evolve
out of separatism to evolve out of this
[SPEAKER_01]: division and diversity i i just think that
we can be done with that and i think that
[SPEAKER_01]: no no not a reflection at all to what
talked about just a just an idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: humanity is using division so much right
now and i just felt like it was a good
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to come in and say that poly
culture and inclusion with diversity is
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely important on this planet and we
see that in in beautiful farms and we see
[SPEAKER_01]: that where plants just don't have any
maladies or any sicknesses we see it where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's full health and balance and i feel
like that's where all of humanity needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: head to and when we look at nature that's
what's happening and i think that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: do away with that diversity and we can
start seeing each other do away with the
[SPEAKER_14]: division division yeah yeah not diversity
sorry do away with the division and i
[SPEAKER_14]: would just like to add like i we've seen
natural people and herbalists and people
[SPEAKER_14]: that do herbal medicine that are really
really healthy and you don't really get to
[SPEAKER_14]: be that person and go in society in
certain places right now i find that hard
[SPEAKER_14]: to understand but i give thanks for the
journey yeah and we're just anyway just
[SPEAKER_01]: let's let's let's let's come together
people that's the next evolution the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: has evolution we talk about the plants
evolution all the time and we need to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about our human evolution in this time as
well love y'all very well put kelly thank
[SPEAKER_05]: you and i certainly didn't mean any
offense to flint or alice i just uh that
[SPEAKER_05]: that joke does have more depth to it than
most will know and i let i say that to
[SPEAKER_05]: people just so they can know that there
are people kind of behind the scenes in
[SPEAKER_05]: anything and everything that just want to
stir shit up and so yeah do with that as
[SPEAKER_05]: you will i'm gonna enjoy a dab of some
beautiful hash rosin i hope that uh it's
[SPEAKER_05]: uh i hope that it'll be accepted here on
hash church even though it's not rosin you
[SPEAKER_12]: gotta remember you gotta remember that you
can make rosin out of both dry sift ash or
[SPEAKER_12]: dry sift resin or water sifted resin and
you can make rosin out of that so i guess
[SPEAKER_12]: we've got two categories dry sift rosin
and water sift rosin and fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_03]: rosin and and fresh rosin you can just
take it off and push it i thought he was
[SPEAKER_09]: gonna say rosin you could make rosin out
of hash but you can't make hash out of
[SPEAKER_12]: rosin oh dr mark with the mic drop nailed
it well if frenchy was here he would find
[SPEAKER_03]: a way for you uh very much you need thick
accent much love kim much love frenchy we
[SPEAKER_17]: miss you we miss you a lot indeed i was
actually um when we when you're all
[SPEAKER_17]: discussing the turps and i was asking if
there was a difference between the rosy
[SPEAKER_17]: the turps in rosy and the turps in hash i
was thinking of what frenchy was always
[SPEAKER_17]: saying about press to activate and going
back to the history of hash that everyone
[SPEAKER_17]: presses hash before they smoke like
everyone's just like making that little
[SPEAKER_17]: ball in their hand or creating calluses in
their hand just like pressing the hash
[SPEAKER_17]: before smoke before putting it in a
chillum before putting it in a pipe and us
[SPEAKER_17]: pressing flags nowadays like before we dab
so this culture was still lingers and i
[SPEAKER_17]: was wondering if you could test that like
if you could just test the sample like the
[SPEAKER_17]: fresh sample and then after the hand press
what is the brief change that that would
[SPEAKER_12]: happen i would love to know that like i
could tell you this much that both i and
[SPEAKER_12]: i'm speaking for marcus but i think i'm
speaking correctly both marcus and i like
[SPEAKER_12]: being or cannabinoid content and it
decreased the surface vaporization area
[SPEAKER_11]: one thing i would add too um just uh as a
thought you know um something that we see
[SPEAKER_11]: in fresh plant material before it's gone
through drying and curing um yeah there's
[SPEAKER_11]: actually some like there's almost like a
very trace signature of various residual
[SPEAKER_11]: solvents that are endogenously produced
solvents that the plant kind of puts out
[SPEAKER_11]: um kind of things like even acetone at
very trace levels but um you know i you
[SPEAKER_11]: know we've we've been um we've been we've
been internally discussing kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: creating kind of like a a live resin live
rosin type um you know kind of uh you know
[SPEAKER_11]: which you know certification type i'm not
certification just almost like stamp you
[SPEAKER_11]: know other people are trying to you know i
mean the whole the whole market is is um
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah there's just people that want to
authenticate basically so whenever
[SPEAKER_11]: something's been live or fresh extracted
from the plant and so we've been we've
[SPEAKER_11]: been like looking at we're starting to
kind of look at side by sides of um and
[SPEAKER_11]: and doing trials with various groups of um
basically measuring kind of terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: content and residual solvent content um
across various extraction and harvest
[SPEAKER_11]: batches to measure um you know basically
what kind of happens and and what what
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of certain things are being expressed
in live plant as opposed to once the
[SPEAKER_11]: drying process happens because even though
in the drying process if you optimally do
[SPEAKER_11]: it you know you very much minimize and
lock in the total you know terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: preservation or profile but there are
these other things that you seem to be
[SPEAKER_11]: happening like the these trace solvent
levels both lies or go away you know kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of in this drying process and so you know
trying to understand more about that but
[SPEAKER_12]: what part of the plant is actually
producing is it is it the uh the uh
[SPEAKER_12]: trichomes that are producing them or is it
other parts of the plant it's a really
[SPEAKER_11]: good question um but you know it does seem
like uh you know kind of even human body
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of we you know i mean just a natural
you know physiological process within the
[SPEAKER_11]: plant or process of the elements is kind
of you know generating these various kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of traits kind of solvents i'm not a
scientist though so i don't know anything
[SPEAKER_09]: malberg's work says that uh trichome
accumulation is after it's synthesized in
[SPEAKER_09]: the in the trichome itself so he kind of
broke down where the cells are that the
[SPEAKER_09]: the terpenes are made where the cells are
that the phenols are made and how they
[SPEAKER_09]: come together in the cannabinoid
biosynthetic pathways i think most of that
[SPEAKER_12]: is actually pretty well worked out as far
as i know that's true it was kim and
[SPEAKER_09]: malberg who did that work yep yeah
professor kim that's right that's right
[SPEAKER_09]: and i think this mark is wreck are
mentioning the interesting little
[SPEAKER_09]: structure in there these things called
vacuoles which are basically little
[SPEAKER_09]: storage vesicles within the cell that uh
then migrate to the surface of the
[SPEAKER_05]: trichome are are plastids and vacuoles
both not organelles i know i believe they
[SPEAKER_05]: are yeah that's what i thought so one
produces phenols one produces the
[SPEAKER_05]: hydrocarbons the terpenes these are the
building blocks for cannabinoid production
[SPEAKER_09]: right well so again the isoprenoid
pathways is endogenous in most plants it's
[SPEAKER_09]: it's how the plant builds cell walls
there's so many different other structures
[SPEAKER_09]: that it uses it just you know it's it's an
economy of carbon that you know the plant
[SPEAKER_09]: has figured out over the time course of
evolution how to make exactly all the
[SPEAKER_09]: structures that it needs to survive and
thrive thank john for that in terms of
[SPEAKER_10]: like going from hash to rosin to to cured
rosin you know i would i would say that
[SPEAKER_10]: there's a there's a distinct difference
from one another however they resemble one
[SPEAKER_10]: another at the same time and it's not only
in texture but also the chemical
[SPEAKER_10]: properties that are present because of the
curing that's happening and whatever path
[SPEAKER_10]: you choose on that curing process whether
you you choose to add heat or not will
[SPEAKER_10]: also contribute to those things so i think
there is nuance however like art it's uh
[SPEAKER_10]: you know these these mediums are very
similar to one another it's just it's on
[SPEAKER_00]: how you approach it awesome i want to say
this about pressing hash in your hand it's
[SPEAKER_00]: so fun you guys to have a little bit of
hash and to be able to press it in a ball
[SPEAKER_00]: and squeeze it and feel it and smell it i
think that that joy of doing that gets me
[SPEAKER_00]: more high when i smoke it you know what i
mean i become intimate with my product and
[SPEAKER_00]: i start to really get excited so i think i
yeah i think i just surf off that so maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what people do it because we like
it it's fun i'm more like did you wash
[SPEAKER_05]: your hands but i want
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system that when we chew
our food the saliva is the very first
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of absorbing it and when we're
working with our our chars and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: touching it and we're putting our dna into
it and maybe we're even softening it not
[SPEAKER_01]: even only intentions you know who knows
what science will do but of course it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the first part of metabolizing that
particular plant and that the that
[SPEAKER_14]: you're gonna like devote a couple of big
trees to just charising all day and it's
[SPEAKER_14]: like you know it's a lot of work and we
were talking about it for a while and just
[SPEAKER_14]: you know really cherishing that that that
hash and that resin that you get
[SPEAKER_14]: afterwards so you know and you're you know
endeavor there's a lot of really special
[SPEAKER_14]: things you can do to keep the cannabis
medicine sacred for you and your community
[SPEAKER_05]: i will say this about that um hashtag
never touched i'll never forget being at a
[SPEAKER_05]: legends of hash dinner and this guy before
the dinner came up to my booth and showed
[SPEAKER_05]: me this beautiful piece of like glistening
caramel i was just like oh my god it
[SPEAKER_05]: looked like full melt he had hand rubbed
it right so he i'm like dude with that you
[SPEAKER_05]: get in you get to buy a ticket so he ended
up at legends i never knew this guy he was
[SPEAKER_05]: a total random stranger i met and just was
like this guy needs to be at legends he
[SPEAKER_05]: hand rubbed like 10 grams of fucking hash
so we go to legends i'm sitting with todd
[SPEAKER_05]: mccormick and his buddy amelio who owns
the trippy stick company the vaporizer
[SPEAKER_05]: company so these guys are like they meet
him right away because he sits at our
[SPEAKER_05]: table he doesn't know anyone else there
except me and he's like hey guys try some
[SPEAKER_05]: of this and so they put a little bit in
their trippy stick and i also tasted it
[SPEAKER_05]: and i have to admit like i don't know if
he was warm and sweaty but it tasted like
[SPEAKER_05]: feet like it was the we laugh about it to
this day like it was so bad i was just
[SPEAKER_05]: like oh my god like etienne you probably
might have been there and you you if not
[SPEAKER_03]: you definitely have heard this story but
i've i've heard the the story of it
[SPEAKER_05]: tasting like absolute human dude trust me
and i'm not like making this up i was like
[SPEAKER_05]: stoked for the guy the hash looked
beautiful it was completely void of any
[SPEAKER_05]: plant matter contaminant but i'm telling
you this was not a terpene profile like
[SPEAKER_05]: this was this was some human interaction
but it was low in thc yeah but it was high
[SPEAKER_03]: in uh bo well i'd like to take my hash and
my keith together and smoke them together
[SPEAKER_03]: so i kind of like why not both you know
what i i can appreciate uh debbie's making
[SPEAKER_05]: the hash i used to love playing with hash
and you know that's a great way to sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: put nervous energy into just rolling up a
piece of hash but i'll tell you that guy
[SPEAKER_05]: at that legends ruined it for me now i'm
just like oh don't touch the hash like
[SPEAKER_05]: hashtag never touch don't touch it oh can
i touch that no you can't touch the hash
[SPEAKER_05]: that's just me i appreciate what josh and
kelly were saying too i don't know when
[SPEAKER_12]: you were in india marcus if the indians
police were checking we were up in the
[SPEAKER_12]: himalayas and they were checking the
sadhu's hands to see if they had hash
[SPEAKER_12]: calluses on them if you'd been rubbing
hash and you had a horseshoe shaped callus
[SPEAKER_12]: on both your hands then they would uh
hassle you would maybe threaten to arrest
[SPEAKER_12]: you or you know use it where and i had one
for i don't know six months growing up in
[SPEAKER_03]: rural louisiana when i was a kid we'd get
pulled over by the cops and they would ask
[SPEAKER_03]: to smell our fingers i didn't know why
because they didn't smoke pot because it
[SPEAKER_03]: was all joints back in the day turns out
they were smelling our fingers to smell if
[SPEAKER_05]: we were out in the cane field smoking
joints damn guys living under and big okay
[SPEAKER_14]: and not love well two things about india i
mean they repealed the farm bill in india
[SPEAKER_14]: which is really huge the farmers have been
fighting for their rights as farmers and
[SPEAKER_14]: food producers in india for well over a
year now and it's it's a phenomenal
[SPEAKER_14]: movement of human power to and vandana
shiva and all the work that that's gone
[SPEAKER_14]: into you know small farmers producing
better quality stuff at a larger rate you
[SPEAKER_14]: know there's a lot of really good
teachings in there so that's really
[SPEAKER_14]: important but also on the cannabis front
in india it's really bad right now and
[SPEAKER_14]: they're just mowing down fields all over
india right now and trapping people and
[SPEAKER_14]: the laws are really really bad in india
and we're we're gonna have a conversation
[SPEAKER_14]: with him fati later on tonight or in the
next couple days she lives in milana she's
[SPEAKER_14]: been in milana for the last two years a
beautiful woman you know doing incredible
[SPEAKER_14]: work and uh you know she's just been
really wanting to get people's attention
[SPEAKER_14]: on to you know what's happening in india
is pretty severe on the cannabis front
[SPEAKER_14]: right now so everyone heads up if there's
anything you can do out there you know to
[SPEAKER_14]: make some change or someone you know in
the realm you know it's it's an important
[SPEAKER_14]: thing right now because we're talking
about origins and we're talking about
[SPEAKER_14]: respecting your elders and and cultures of
where it came from and now some of those
[SPEAKER_14]: places are under fire and they're just
taking brushed cutters and just mowing
[SPEAKER_14]: down giant fields and stuff and it's
pretty hardcore so sorry they're they're
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting indian celebrities too i see
that they're taking down all these people
[SPEAKER_00]: at the high levels to just scare the crap
out of everyone in india it makes no sense
[SPEAKER_00]: when the rest of the globe is moving in
another direction yet here one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: places of origin for the cannabis plant is
behaving like that it's anti-scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-logical as far as i'm concerned in
germany this week let me look at germany
[SPEAKER_03]: germany is going to legalize cannabis
which is a huge signifier for the eu but
[SPEAKER_03]: at the same time going back to what uh
michael krauts and a group i'm working
[SPEAKER_03]: with at the united nations are doing i
mean we already uh got uh cannabis removed
[SPEAKER_03]: from schedule four so actually medical
cannabis is legal and indians could be
[SPEAKER_03]: fighting at the un regarding international
uh specifically and we're gonna medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis groups in india and we will also
be back in vienna in march uh working on
[SPEAKER_03]: drug policy as well we're gonna have a
group of us in new york and a group of us
[SPEAKER_03]: in vienna so we're working on another
country another country that we hear about
[SPEAKER_09]: in the news a lot these days china do you
know what china's policy is towards
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis not friendly don't get caught
with it yeah they they got in touch with
[SPEAKER_05]: canada's government and said we don't want
our citizens using medical marijuana using
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational marijuana like made a
statement government to government about
[SPEAKER_09]: chinese kids for the synthetic labs over
there to basically be making fentanyl and
[SPEAKER_09]: dumping it in mexico where it basically
comes to the border and ends up in in
[SPEAKER_09]: basic well yeah it there's a lot of things
that don't make sense like when we had
[SPEAKER_09]: that chinese or the japanese fella there
who was looking at what like 30 years for
[SPEAKER_09]: smoking a joint or something like that
makes no sense at all when you consider
[SPEAKER_09]: all of the business the picks and shovels
businesses that are in china and that are
[SPEAKER_09]: in japan that are greatly benefiting from
what's happening with cannabis across the
[SPEAKER_12]: globe 30 years for a joint it's a good
thing he wasn't smoking a bomb they would
[SPEAKER_14]: have given him 50 and and because
Singapore just got two i think a death
[SPEAKER_08]: penalty for two pounds a week just just
recently and but but kyle that's
[SPEAKER_11]: fascinating that china most right what do
you think that i think that's really
[SPEAKER_11]: fascinating that china took that approach
just as such a like autocratic and control
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of you know but i mean because
cannabis and i would imagine all the other
[SPEAKER_11]: psychoactive and theogenic plants and
plant medicines of the of you know around
[SPEAKER_11]: the world are so subversive to their
narrative and then you see how much legal
[SPEAKER_09]: in autocracy they need to control the way
people think and if people can basically
[SPEAKER_09]: grow their own medicine and think for
themselves and autocracy can't exist so it
[SPEAKER_05]: does get political but what makes you like
when you're just kind of looking at the
[SPEAKER_05]: world cannabis economy right you're
looking at the world cannabis economy
[SPEAKER_05]: you're like i need to make a bit of money
what makes you think like you know what
[SPEAKER_05]: i'm going for singapore it's the biggest
bang for my buck it's like no listen just
[SPEAKER_05]: not even making a joke these motherfuckers
are not fucking around they have giant
[SPEAKER_05]: zero tolerance you know signs death
penalty like the whole nine yards like i
[SPEAKER_05]: wouldn't even go renew my visa there when
i was in thailand people like we're all
[SPEAKER_05]: going down to singapore to renew our visas
and i'm like oh well have fun with that
[SPEAKER_05]: like i smoke hash every single day like
it's probably on me right now stuck to me
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere that i don't even know if not
for sure i have enough in my bloodstream
[SPEAKER_05]: to get like 20 or 30 years so i never have
to worry amazing mark the whole world is
[SPEAKER_12]: changing who knows before long even
malaysia might be growing marijuana for
[SPEAKER_09]: people as medicine anything is possible at
the nj bizcon in vegas a couple weeks ago
[SPEAKER_09]: i did meet a couple uh folks from mainland
china who are mostly over looking at uh
[SPEAKER_09]: cbd and cbd type products but they were
absolutely floored i don't think they
[SPEAKER_09]: expected to see the level of thc products
that there are available and so these guys
[SPEAKER_09]: i i think if i had them characterized
right they own a bunch of bodegas in in
[SPEAKER_09]: new york city the new york city area i
think mostly like queens and brooklyn and
[SPEAKER_09]: these bodegas are basically you know small
little uh you know uh shops to get
[SPEAKER_09]: sandwiches you know sodas you know bags of
chips and stuff like that but they sell
[SPEAKER_09]: everything they sell newspapers they sell
all kinds of stuff and so now they want to
[SPEAKER_09]: basically start selling cbd but they were
totally adamant like it's been put into
[SPEAKER_09]: their head that you know any thc
associated with these products is totally
[SPEAKER_09]: bad and i think it's because of their
culture and it's because of where they
[SPEAKER_09]: come from but i think now they recognize
the financial opportunity that exists and
[SPEAKER_09]: now they're probably going to go back to
their folks and say hey man we can make
[SPEAKER_09]: cbd and or sell the cbd products but
ultimately people see you know people want
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis and so they were really
interested in hhc and delta-8 and all
[SPEAKER_09]: these other you know non-thc cannabinoids
but as soon as you mention thc it's like
[SPEAKER_09]: oh put the brakes on that we're not into
can't no no no no can't do that no full
[SPEAKER_09]: spectrum anything only these other things
so well that's that's what's so comedical
[SPEAKER_11]: about this plant too it's it's so
subversive just by its nature you know and
[SPEAKER_11]: and so we're alluring for all these ways
that you know also you know are you know
[SPEAKER_11]: ultimately kind of persuade one one group
or another but you know i think like
[SPEAKER_11]: whenever really comes to so much of the
potential of this plant the greatness
[SPEAKER_11]: really comes in the vital remediation that
this plant can do and and and and
[SPEAKER_11]: potentiate and accelerate and and i think
as a strategic national resource and
[SPEAKER_11]: strategic global resources you know as
this you know this information comes more
[SPEAKER_11]: and more i mean just the you know the
necessity that every country you know for
[SPEAKER_11]: their own sustainability has to kind of
clean up and restore their soil is you
[SPEAKER_11]: know i mean you know ultimately hams gonna
win and hopefully help subvert the whole
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of brainwash out there a free
enterprise itself these are chinese
[SPEAKER_09]: businessmen they just want to make money
that's all they care about is return on
[SPEAKER_09]: investment return and so i think in their
mind they're re-educating themselves based
[SPEAKER_09]: on what they see in the u.s market they
have people walking into those stores
[SPEAKER_09]: asking for delta-8 products asking for cvd
products so all they know is that there's
[SPEAKER_09]: a market we better go to this trade show
line up some supply chain agreements start
[SPEAKER_09]: getting those products into our 150
bodegas that we have isn't around the new
[SPEAKER_09]: york city area because this is just going
to be like this isn't going away right and
[SPEAKER_09]: the interesting thing again is that if you
look at what's happening with some of the
[SPEAKER_09]: minor cannabinoids it's really taking a
different route in every state because
[SPEAKER_09]: some states are outright banning you know
delta 8 and and and banning hhc and all
[SPEAKER_09]: these other things that you could make but
other states are are choosing to regulate
[SPEAKER_09]: those underneath their delta 9 licenses
and so it'll be interesting to see how
[SPEAKER_09]: that shakes out because it's almost like
there's a different program a different
[SPEAKER_10]: regulatory structure in in every state hey
dr mark um since you know so we we hung
[SPEAKER_10]: out at mj biz and i wanted to ask you
because i knew that that the delta 8 was
[SPEAKER_10]: going to come down in in the federal
ruling and they're going to start to allow
[SPEAKER_10]: this and we we both kind of share the same
ideology it seems that it's extremely
[SPEAKER_10]: dangerous to do things like that um how do
you feel that ruling affects where you
[SPEAKER_10]: know the heavy industry is at today
allowing delta 8 to be now now in the the
[SPEAKER_09]: supply chain well first of all it's only
made possible through the ridiculousness
[SPEAKER_09]: of prohibition itself right so if delta 9
wasn't prohibited there would be no market
[SPEAKER_09]: for delta 8 yeah is just because well okay
people want to get high cvd but these
[SPEAKER_09]: people could basically make cvd like
there's no tomorrow finding out that
[SPEAKER_09]: there's no market for it they convert it
now to thc in this case delta 8 and now
[SPEAKER_09]: you can get people high here's an
interesting trend you're starting to see
[SPEAKER_09]: people making delta 9 from hemp and they
think it's legal but in in my mind and
[SPEAKER_09]: again maybe not just my mind but i think
in the way the law works is that you know
[SPEAKER_09]: the exclusion of thc in the control
dangerous substance act has
[SPEAKER_09]: tetrahydrocannabinols including delta 8
including drenabinol including delta 9
[SPEAKER_09]: they're all categorized under code 7370
and while i don't agree with first or
[SPEAKER_09]: schedule one listing of thc because it's
not dangerous so it doesn't need to be
[SPEAKER_09]: controlled that's where the government has
it like it or not and until they move it
[SPEAKER_09]: out of there you need a thc license to
sell these products legally now the the
[SPEAKER_09]: conundrum is is that they're all being
made from hemp derived starting material
[SPEAKER_09]: so you have hemp processors largely
operating in an unregulated environment
[SPEAKER_09]: with no regulatory oversight whatsoever in
the most cannabis unfriendly states like
[SPEAKER_09]: tennessee and alabama mississippi but even
in cannabis friendly states in colorado
[SPEAKER_09]: for example there are a lot of hemp
processors now who are making these other
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids because there's a market form
but a lot of that market again
[SPEAKER_09]: i don't think it was ever the intention of
congress when they passed the farm bill to
[SPEAKER_09]: enable the production of a psychoactive
substance that's why they put the whole
[SPEAKER_09]: thing about thc it had to be 0.3 i don't
think the intellectual furnaces were
[SPEAKER_09]: burning hot enough to understand that
mishulam and adams and all these other
[SPEAKER_09]: people oh they figured out you could
convert cbt to thc we knew that because we
[SPEAKER_09]: knew the literature and i was like well
this is just waiting to happen i started
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing then hhc and everybody started
bringing my phone off the hook saying hey
[SPEAKER_09]: aren't you the guy that patented
hydrogenation how could these guys be
[SPEAKER_09]: hydro you know so what they were doing is
they're now converting their delta 8 which
[SPEAKER_09]: again remembers code 7370 on in total
dangerous substance it says you need a
[SPEAKER_09]: license the license of those those
businesses is all under mostly vertically
[SPEAKER_09]: integrated delta 9 delta
[SPEAKER_09]: 8 is probably fine and hhc is probably
fine too but the way it's being produced
[SPEAKER_09]: right now is probably not the safest for
for human consumption i think that things
[SPEAKER_09]: are moving along pretty quickly but we we
have a patent on hhca not on hhc and so
[SPEAKER_09]: all these hhc producers i think are just
taking their delta 8 which again is listed
[SPEAKER_09]: in the control dangerous substance act
hydrogenating it converting it to hhc and
[SPEAKER_09]: people seem to really like hhc the hhc
introduction at least across the hemp
[SPEAKER_09]: markets have been pretty successful these
guys are making a lot of money selling it
[SPEAKER_00]: and um yeah that's it well out here we're
not seeing in the bay area at least those
[SPEAKER_00]: cvd shops all around like i've seen other
places when i've left town because we got
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries everywhere and they just
changed the state law that's going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: now we can sell at dispensaries the hemp
derived cvd and t what's other than delta
[SPEAKER_00]: 8 but they haven't finished putting the
regulations in but i'm pretty sure that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just because they want to take the tax off
the top of that but that's pretty big
[SPEAKER_09]: that's a pretty big decision right debbie
and that's kind of like i think from what
[SPEAKER_09]: i understand tommy if i'm correct here so
the thing that the um the charlotte's web
[SPEAKER_09]: people tried to do federally with the fda
in allowing cvd x from industrial hemp to
[SPEAKER_09]: be allowed as a new dietary ingredient or
new type of stuff no i think gavin newston
[SPEAKER_09]: said fuck you yeah that in california to
get these minor cannabinoids uh to market
[SPEAKER_00]: is that right debbie yeah i think that is
right they just haven't put the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: scheme together yet so we don't know what
it's going to look like when they start
[SPEAKER_00]: showing up at our shop so how we're going
to be able to sell it or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that yet but yeah i think california is
doing the smart decision um bucking it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of that federal trend and just doing
what needs to be done so i don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening so just one day the
ruling came out yeah you know and a little
[SPEAKER_11]: background on that too and before
beginning that like mark one point you
[SPEAKER_11]: were talking to me bringing up though
because there's all the cbd shops you know
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of that are everywhere but you like
delta and a cartridges and hhc cartridges
[SPEAKER_11]: and stuff you can go into most head shops
kind of just like random kind of uh we go
[SPEAKER_11]: to bodega style kind of like some vape
shops or head shops and you find them
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty accessibly way beyond kind of just
the centralized cbd shops that pop up just
[SPEAKER_11]: really selling cbd type products you know
and so that's that's a whole fascinating
[SPEAKER_11]: issue and dilemma um that's that's you
know going to play out interesting ways
[SPEAKER_11]: but but on the hemp bill um you know it's
been really fascinating because you know
[SPEAKER_11]: for the last you know um many years now
two three years there's um you know been
[SPEAKER_11]: basically the hemp bill that tried to get
pushed through you know kind of really
[SPEAKER_11]: without any regard to public health and
safety under the guise of industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of just kind of having testing
regulations around tc which seemed really
[SPEAKER_11]: as a trippy kind of big ag subversion type
of the whole space and uh california
[SPEAKER_11]: farmers in the licensed space were like
homie don't play that and um basically
[SPEAKER_11]: shot it down each year you know because
you know how why do people growing the
[SPEAKER_11]: same plants you know because most people
are growing industrial hemp aren't growing
[SPEAKER_11]: are not growing industrial hemp 95 of
those people are going type three drug
[SPEAKER_11]: cultivars of cannabis you know and under
the guise of industrial hemp but are
[SPEAKER_11]: growing it that much more in industrial
agricultural areas where there's that much
[SPEAKER_11]: more contamination potential pesticides
and metals and all these things and so you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of there's wildly kind of
unregulated use of the word hemp and what
[SPEAKER_11]: it's actually being used for whether it's
medicine drug supply chain or whether it's
[SPEAKER_11]: like actual industrial fiber for you know
processing and all these other things um
[SPEAKER_11]: and so california kind of this year passed
you know ab 45 to establish um uh you know
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of for the first time cannabis you
know or hemp products in the licensed
[SPEAKER_11]: supply chain and kind of essentially
allowing for you know kind of other states
[SPEAKER_11]: to get you know kind of cvd products into
the state but they put in place a level of
[SPEAKER_11]: parity with the kind of you know cannabis
testing regulations for licensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: you know with regard to all these points
on public health and safety um you know
[SPEAKER_11]: and so so it's a huge step forward and
they're you know that's going to be you
[SPEAKER_11]: know playing out and i think that's really
going to help set a national standard for
[SPEAKER_11]: at which hemp should be tested um you know
especially if it's going to be making you
[SPEAKER_11]: know made into like medicine supply chain
for pediatric epilepsy kids cancer
[SPEAKER_11]: patients dietary supplement world of you
know kind of you know this cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: these cannabinoids but um but the you know
it's it's it's it's hardly kind of on the
[SPEAKER_11]: same playing field or level with regard to
you know kind of um you know batch
[SPEAKER_11]: required i mean there's there's um you
know kind of testing requirements in place
[SPEAKER_11]: but there's not really a you know supply
chain regulated supply chain you know in
[SPEAKER_09]: any way for him you guys have an
analytical standard for hhc alex no um i
[SPEAKER_11]: would love to talk to you more about that
i really appreciate that i appreciate your
[SPEAKER_11]: insight also you you have a very very
nuanced very specific understanding of
[SPEAKER_11]: this whole thing that is really far beyond
running around the internet basically
[SPEAKER_09]: correcting all these bogus articles that
people are writing on
[SPEAKER_09]: and hopefully it'll set the ground
straight and you know people will will say
[SPEAKER_09]: okay yeah this guy knows what he's talking
about here's here's what this is right
[SPEAKER_09]: because there's all kinds of speculation
on what it is out there and people just
[SPEAKER_11]: don't know one thing i want to say real
quick um and i'm sorry colin if you were
[SPEAKER_11]: about to speak speak up but um you know
it's it's funny this whole conversation
[SPEAKER_11]: around these kind of versions um you know
for you know we from the whole community
[SPEAKER_11]: of extract artists you know we we've been
catching a lot of shit for a long time and
[SPEAKER_11]: losing a lot of really good business for
people with people that you know kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: uh you know we you know we would show a
test result with accuracy chroma accurate
[SPEAKER_11]: chromatography and and and show people at
like 40 delta 9 in their distillate or you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of whatever right but you see
these huge peaks of these problems beyond
[SPEAKER_11]: delta 8 because we identify delta 8 but
you know delta 10 all these other kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: you know whatever they're you know state
of the art isomer that there are around
[SPEAKER_11]: you know it's yeah but now there's a whole
no i'm just gonna say now there's a like i
[SPEAKER_11]: mean we're catching shit about like you
know not doing it right and people are
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of you know just going to labs that
would misidentify those peaks as delta 9
[SPEAKER_11]: you know but now like it's just funny
because now there's this like starting to
[SPEAKER_11]: be widespread understanding of oh you
could actually through distillation
[SPEAKER_11]: process create all these isomers and now
there's these widespread like you know
[SPEAKER_09]: these other you know yeah i i was just
gonna say the funny thing is that you hear
[SPEAKER_09]: fear-mongering in the in the blogs of
people who don't know what they're talking
[SPEAKER_09]: about talking about all these unknowns in
there all unknowns unknowns unknowns it's
[SPEAKER_09]: like well if you read the chemical
literature like i do i can tell you that
[SPEAKER_09]: they're not unknown at all in fact they're
quite known it's known exactly what made
[SPEAKER_09]: in this reaction and so like when you do
this conversion of cvd to thc it generates
[SPEAKER_09]: non-natural isomers that aren't formed in
the plant they all have the same molecular
[SPEAKER_09]: weight 314 and certainly in the the the
testing labs that i've talked to about
[SPEAKER_09]: this and the samples that i've seen those
compounds are in every they're there
[SPEAKER_09]: unless you have this figured out they're
in they're in all of these mixtures and we
[SPEAKER_09]: really don't know what their long-term
impact is to human safety so we we just
[SPEAKER_09]: don't know because they're not made by the
plant and this is the first time they're
[SPEAKER_09]: being made for human consumption and so
it'll be interesting to see if folks who
[SPEAKER_09]: are producing this are able to not only
quantify what those isomers are but
[SPEAKER_09]: basically set product specification limits
so you know that if a batch has got two
[SPEAKER_09]: percent well two percent is no good but we
need to be down at 0.5 or whatever the
[SPEAKER_09]: cutoff is on some of these but they until
they do the safety assessments on these
[SPEAKER_10]: compounds this is just a guessing game so
that was kind of my my question to alec i
[SPEAKER_10]: guess was was do we have the ability to
even test for these these isomers and and
[SPEAKER_10]: differentiate them from one another to
then call them out right say okay well
[SPEAKER_10]: this is now present so this is this is
most likely
[SPEAKER_11]: so so you know i think the burden of
proving these compounds is on the
[SPEAKER_11]: manufacturers creating them more than it's
on the lab to like identify these novel
[SPEAKER_11]: compounds and chase to see if like the you
know kind of the trends of where the
[SPEAKER_11]: market's creating isomers to be able to
quantify you know i think that requires a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of r and d work in you know with the
laboratory to help you know be able to you
[SPEAKER_11]: know identify what the compounds are that
the group's creating you know
[SPEAKER_11]: well then like what you know wheat labs
can kind of you know stay up to date on
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of having these compounds added into
their their methods and validated um you
[SPEAKER_11]: know but but again i think you know it's
funny because in the past we've kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: caught so much shit from clients you know
that that that basically are like my this
[SPEAKER_11]: distillate is 40 thc you know you're wrong
you know why what is this other 60 percent
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's like dude it's a it's a novel
compound it's like this ghost cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: isomer that you've created i have no idea
what it is there's not a standard for it
[SPEAKER_11]: um like i can show you a chromatogram that
it's clearly that and it's not built in
[SPEAKER_11]: nine you know but but we're testing for
these compounds like delta nine that we
[SPEAKER_11]: have validated tested hundreds of
thousands of times you know and so so i
[SPEAKER_11]: think that work there's like you know
novel work that needs to be done with kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of manufacturers that are making these
compounds to be able to kind of you know
[SPEAKER_09]: again do at that stage when they've just
made 20 kilos of this stuff they want it
[SPEAKER_09]: to be 40 or 80 percent or they want it to
be exactly it's an ungodly low percent and
[SPEAKER_09]: it's got all this other crap in there like
oh let's just you know white film distill
[SPEAKER_09]: it and put it in gummies you know and and
i think again i'd like to think that
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a place for chemists to play in
history and i think
[SPEAKER_09]: it's like if your process doesn't make
something that's greater than 90 percent
[SPEAKER_09]: yield it ain't ready for prime time and
let you know what that other 10 is and you
[SPEAKER_09]: can describe that other 10 to known
compounds or bridge to known compounds of
[SPEAKER_09]: known safety then you don't have a safe
product there so whether it's delta eight
[SPEAKER_09]: or whether it's hhc these are no longer
naturally occurring in a plant and you
[SPEAKER_09]: can't refine a plant extract to get those
compounds you're talking about a reaction
[SPEAKER_09]: product of a chemical reaction and i don't
know about you i hope that it's a chemist
[SPEAKER_09]: like me running that chemical reaction
that knows what the hell it is they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing yeah truth yeah yeah i think sort of
the hilarity of all of this and if we look
[SPEAKER_01]: at it from you know uh you know an outward
standpoint of how you know the brains of
[SPEAKER_01]: human beings we fractaled this medicine so
much we've created so many different laws
[SPEAKER_01]: and so many different regulations and
because humans are adaptogens then we're
[SPEAKER_01]: always trying to jump through the hoops of
the regulations and i just think it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: hilarious that this plant continues to be
fractaled out in all of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways so we can jump through all the hoops
that we're creating so that we can even
[SPEAKER_01]: create that we can't jump through anymore
i just think that it's pretty funny that
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant is so adaptogenic in the way
that we are in our thinking and that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with all these different ways that
just really don't make any sense but hey
[SPEAKER_11]: they got through a hoop i really
appreciate that thought you know it
[SPEAKER_11]: reminds me of i was at an international
cannabinoid research society conference
[SPEAKER_11]: one year and you know there's all these
amazing you know you know presentations
[SPEAKER_11]: and knowledge transfer and all this and
then and then there was this like you know
[SPEAKER_11]: phd like super tenured dea like chemist
that was presenting about this like cat
[SPEAKER_11]: and mouse game that dea is having and this
really big problem that there's all these
[SPEAKER_11]: synthetic cannabinoids that are hitting
the market and like they'll you know spice
[SPEAKER_11]: and k2 and all these things and then like
the you know the the only way they'll even
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of find out about them is through
some widespread kind of outbreak of like
[SPEAKER_11]: some really adverse reaction and then they
all of a sudden kind of test that supply
[SPEAKER_11]: identify this way crazy new compound that
a cannabinoid and then they schedule it
[SPEAKER_11]: and then it and then by the time they've
scheduled it then there's new compounds in
[SPEAKER_11]: the market and it's and and it's this
whole cat and they're like presenting this
[SPEAKER_11]: dilemma this cat and mouse game that
they're having it's so hard and it's like
[SPEAKER_11]: in the whole time the whole kind of people
everybody in the audience is just like
[SPEAKER_11]: staring at i'm like pissed because it's
like it's the prohibition on this plant
[SPEAKER_11]: that's creating the market for all these
super fractal kind of like you know almost
[SPEAKER_11]: like um dystopian like just like all way
off the plant's kind of path of of what
[SPEAKER_11]: this you know of cannabinoid to the market
but you know they're doing it anyway and
[SPEAKER_11]: it's making it out there you know some of
this a lot so many unsynthetic ones are
[SPEAKER_11]: like really gnarly you know i you know i'd
be curious about like long-term efficacy
[SPEAKER_11]: for delta 8 or h8c and all that you know
and it's probably it's probably good it's
[SPEAKER_11]: probably fine you know compared to some of
these crazy synthetic cannabinoids but um
[SPEAKER_11]: but again yes like it's just so trippy
because it's the prohibition on this plant
[SPEAKER_11]: that's like leading to all this divergence
from the path you know instead of you know
[SPEAKER_11]: being able to actually cherish the like
magical magic that the plant actually
[SPEAKER_11]: presents if you just give it the chance
yeah but the feds have that law the
[SPEAKER_00]: blanket law the analog law that says that
anything that is a spinoff from a drug uh
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one is a schedule one drug but
the thing is is it's like that uh
[SPEAKER_00]: toothpaste out of the tube thing what are
they going to do come after everyone at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point that like we've literally
outnumbered the dea and the feds so
[SPEAKER_00]: hardcore they can never get it back in the
toothpaste will never ever go back in tube
[SPEAKER_09]: at this point never it's over i think this
is just all part of the movement to
[SPEAKER_09]: de-schedule the plant and to take thc off
the list you know again it flies in the
[SPEAKER_09]: face of conventional knowledge that there
are several fda approved drugs where
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids that are from the plant are
the active ingredients in those drugs they
[SPEAKER_09]: have a good therapeutic index they have
low toxicity yet the plant from which
[SPEAKER_09]: they're derived has no medical value come
on that's been happening since you know
[SPEAKER_14]: even lsd and and hoffman and and allsley
stanley and uh nick sand who were making
[SPEAKER_14]: lsd and tim scully and tim scully a lot of
people don't know about tim scully which
[SPEAKER_14]: is not rock scully and uh you know just
talking about how you know there's early
[SPEAKER_14]: um crystal that was made you know during a
time when it was legal and then they the
[SPEAKER_14]: fda started or the government started
going after it and then they said oh we
[SPEAKER_14]: were trying to produce a what was it ald
52 you know and they're like hey come on
[SPEAKER_14]: this was lsd 25 you know so you know and
these people went on to like do other
[SPEAKER_14]: amazing labs all over the place so for
sure you know that's that's the the
[SPEAKER_06]: chemist you know you just just heat it up
and
[SPEAKER_09]: realm and it's also very that's been a
very fruitful area i just want i'm just
[SPEAKER_09]: gonna i'm just gonna say it's been a very
fruitful area in in general to look at
[SPEAKER_09]: inspiration from biology so when you look
at the compounds that biology produces
[SPEAKER_09]: that's where a lot of our pharmaceuticals
and drugs are discovered they're
[SPEAKER_09]: discovered by making analogs around those
pharmaceuticals or those those what we
[SPEAKER_09]: what typically in drug discovery they call
privilege platforms so a privileged
[SPEAKER_09]: platform is just a molecule like a
cannabinoid that no matter what group
[SPEAKER_09]: should decorate on it it's going to have
some level of activity the great thing
[SPEAKER_09]: about cannabinoids just in terms of their
therapeutic index is that they're
[SPEAKER_09]: ultimately not toxic so a lot of these
compounds especially the compounds that
[SPEAKER_09]: were developed by pharmaceutical companies
to act on the cannabinoid receptors not
[SPEAKER_09]: only are they toxic as hell but they have
a lot of non-specific interactions they
[SPEAKER_09]: interact not just with the cannabinoid
receptors but with every receptor in the
[SPEAKER_09]: body and so you can't just throw a monkey
wrench into the engine of your body and
[SPEAKER_09]: expect it not to have any deleterious
impact that's the great thing about the
[SPEAKER_09]: phyto cannabinoid skeleton in general is
that you know it's very lipid soluble and
[SPEAKER_09]: so because our bodies have a lot of fat
especially my body those those that fat is
[SPEAKER_09]: basically reservoirs to hold just like a
dirty bond those cannabinoids inside your
[SPEAKER_09]: body as long as we possibly can so our
body has actually evolved mechanisms to
[SPEAKER_09]: hold onto these compounds because they're
so beneficial and the last thing i'll say
[SPEAKER_09]: is that unlike most antioxidants in our
diet like the polyphenols and coffee and
[SPEAKER_09]: grape juice and shit like that unlike
those types of antioxidants those are
[SPEAKER_09]: water soluble cannabinoids are not water
soluble so indefinitely they they protect
[SPEAKER_09]: the fatty tissues of your body from
oxidative damage caused by free radicals
[SPEAKER_09]: so again it's been said many times before
cannabis used all uses medical because
[SPEAKER_09]: you're protecting the fatty tissues of
your body including your pancreas your
[SPEAKER_09]: brain and your kidneys against from
radical mediated oxidative damage so these
[SPEAKER_09]: things are going to be looked as a new
supplement in the future because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to lead to healthier humans jump in
about them you said uh something about a
[SPEAKER_01]: monkey wrench and i just wanted to say
that when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals and then extracting
certain compounds and those compounds that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been maybe isolated and studied and
then that's what's being put inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: human well that lacks the full spectrum
that lacks the full thing so what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: also finding is when we're synthesizing
and when we're isolating that like that
[SPEAKER_01]: without the full absorption of the full
plant we're actually creating more
[SPEAKER_01]: maladies and more side effects with these
drugs because we failed to look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole integration of all of the different
compounds within the drugs and that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: pointing out you know more hoops that we
like to put up for ourselves and how funny
[SPEAKER_11]: that is and how it does i'm sorry um yeah
i actually wanted to follow up on both
[SPEAKER_11]: both of those great points um you know
like um you know and and a big shout out
[SPEAKER_11]: to ethnobotany and legendary
ethnobotanists of the past you know that
[SPEAKER_11]: have kind of really helped to carry the
these this coveted wisdom about the
[SPEAKER_11]: medicinal properties of plants to western
world which has kind of been the
[SPEAKER_11]: foundation of so much of the modern
pharmaceutical kind of compounds created
[SPEAKER_11]: so many anti-histamines that we use and
are around really are kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: foundationally kind of tied to like
deterrent toey and bramancia and kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: scopolamine kind of related type compounds
and stuff and there's and it goes so far
[SPEAKER_11]: beyond that you know aspirin and you know
just and just the root of so much of the
[SPEAKER_11]: medicines that pharmaceutical use is
pretty much all is is you know found in in
[SPEAKER_11]: plant you know foundations and so you know
there's a this really amazing podcast i
[SPEAKER_11]: would highly recommend from um the great
ethnobotanist dr mark plotkin um called
[SPEAKER_11]: plants of the gods you know kind of name
and tribute to you know great uh albert
[SPEAKER_11]: hoffman and richard evan schultes that
wrote the book together the back of the
[SPEAKER_11]: day but there's a podcast um called plants
of the gods that kind of you know from a
[SPEAKER_11]: really amazing kind of biocultural
conservational aspect kind of attributes
[SPEAKER_11]: plants and the people where these plants
kind of uh you know kind of come from um
[SPEAKER_06]: and in you know and just a really really
beautiful narrative
[SPEAKER_11]: over time and you know a lot more uh in in
in uh all in and in service to that path
[SPEAKER_11]: and you know the pharmaceutical discovery
path you know to start just like randomly
[SPEAKER_11]: trying to start plugging out receptors you
know in that way of hacking into the
[SPEAKER_11]: systems that are already perfectly figured
out um but anyway just want to share that
[SPEAKER_05]: i'm glad you did i just want to follow
that podcast it's an amazing podcast it
[SPEAKER_09]: really is and if you ever get a chance i
think he's he's either got a ted talk or
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a youtube of a talk that he gave
his photographs are fucking amazing he he
[SPEAKER_09]: has some of the most amazing photographs
of the amazon that i've ever seen sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just sort of cool to to remind
ourselves that no matter what we have
[SPEAKER_01]: created in the name of science or whatever
we have manipulated as far as carbon or as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as any kind of compounds it's all of
the earth everything that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulated and it's all come from the
earth even like the plastics yes they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not naturally occurring but everything is
of the earth and i just think that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a really interesting thing that of
course all of our medicinals would come
[SPEAKER_01]: from the plants because they're of the
earth everything would be coming of the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth so of course we've figured out ways
to synthesize it and make it unhealthy for
[SPEAKER_01]: us and that's been um really awesome in
pharmacopia you're blowing my my secret
[SPEAKER_09]: ingredient stardust right we put stardust
in the really special stuff
[SPEAKER_09]: we're not importing feedstocks from mars
not yet right not yet although who knows
[SPEAKER_14]: right and i love the work of alexander uh
sasha shulgin and all of the compounds
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah blessings all for sure yeah blessings
on him of course yeah if you're going to
[SPEAKER_14]: talk about psychoactive drugs and
different you know i mean how many did he
[SPEAKER_14]: make and i think he was in the you know
trying them all and just really supporting
[SPEAKER_14]: all of the doctors throughout all these
years you don't know it but like alexander
[SPEAKER_14]: shulgin is just right there you know in
court cases and uh um studies and stuff
[SPEAKER_14]: and you know give thanks for some of the
medicines that you know were created there
[SPEAKER_09]: for sure he wasn't yeah you know there's
still a whole lot of work to do there
[SPEAKER_09]: really there is right again his two
textbooks right tryptamines and and
[SPEAKER_09]: phenethylamines these are again privileged
platforms that you can decorate with just
[SPEAKER_09]: about any molecular spin that you want
you're only limited by the imagination of
[SPEAKER_09]: the chemist right and so you could put a
group over here see what it does take a
[SPEAKER_09]: few pills oh that makes me feel tired and
he did let's put another group over here
[SPEAKER_11]: you know and really do your own sar and
and you know what's fascinating is i think
[SPEAKER_11]: those are the two divergent paths really
with the plants you know it's like this
[SPEAKER_11]: ethnobotanical like bio cultural
conservation like supporting the
[SPEAKER_11]: communities where the medicines come from
and understanding how to use them most
[SPEAKER_11]: effectively in reverence to the to the
plant and to the people where they come
[SPEAKER_11]: from and then also this this world of
discovery and kind of like being able to
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of you know create these novel
compounds in the shulgin kind of uh
[SPEAKER_11]: tribute and path you know and and some of
my favorite you know medicines like 2 cv
[SPEAKER_11]: you know kind of our shulgin compounds um
and and um you know and i think i think in
[SPEAKER_11]: the in this other kind of side of this
compound you know which is relevant to our
[SPEAKER_11]: conversation it's the beta cannabinoids
and all these hhc kind of delta 8 delta 10
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of stuff you know it's you know kind
of there's this and this is this creation
[SPEAKER_11]: you know potential of you know kind of
being able to you know hack the you know
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of the other the molecular you know
kind of understanding of the
[SPEAKER_11]: endocannabinoid system and tryptamines and
you know dopamine system and all this and
[SPEAKER_11]: be able to create compounds that can fit
into these pathways but i do also believe
[SPEAKER_11]: that very strongly that there's an
incredible again burden of proof that is
[SPEAKER_11]: on those people that are making these
compounds and especially if they're going
[SPEAKER_11]: to be made them making them readily and
you know accessibly available to to
[SPEAKER_11]: improve efficacy and quality and efficacy
and safety you know first and foremost um
[SPEAKER_11]: before kind of there's this just as rapid
release you know because you know i think
[SPEAKER_11]: you know there's you know shulgin's really
the only dude that did it really right you
[SPEAKER_11]: know i think in his world and i think
people that took kind of shulgin kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: paths with the endocannabinoid system to
create all these novel you know kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: synthetic cannabinoids that have kind of
gone to lead to all these outbreaks of
[SPEAKER_11]: just public health issues you know kind of
did shulgin a disservice you know kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: in that because they were just they they
weren't they weren't creating the molecule
[SPEAKER_11]: and dosing themselves and figuring out the
thing and then like putting that out very
[SPEAKER_11]: responsibly they were just like creating
batches and like dosing the population you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and that's pretty yeah the other
thing is is that we don't look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term effects of this you know what
shulgin put out is he definitely had mass
[SPEAKER_01]: peer studies but he's just one man in an
adult life creating pretty phenomenal
[SPEAKER_01]: things and massive peer review studies
that were on his own and i just feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: here it is again that we're putting
shackles on the possibility and the
[SPEAKER_01]: educational attributes of plant medicine
when we continuously try to regulate them
[SPEAKER_01]: because what would it be like what kind of
a society would we be if we were readily
[SPEAKER_01]: able to use coca leaves every day in our
teas that would help uh you know lift us
[SPEAKER_01]: for our days rather than have to party on
the weekends with this super synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: extract and we don't look at the longevity
of that if we were able to totally free
[SPEAKER_01]: that up i feel like it would lessen the
the need for us to continue to synthesize
[SPEAKER_01]: these things that would be more normalized
in our own tea cabinet that we would have
[SPEAKER_01]: you know concentrated sassafras bark that
we were taking every day especially for
[SPEAKER_01]: the rainy days that you know mdma is made
out of that we could get that maybe in a
[SPEAKER_14]: chewing gum or whatever canary grass or
san pedro cactus yeah you know what i mean
[SPEAKER_14]: like there's just interesting straight to
the tea straight to the old world you know
[SPEAKER_14]: what i mean that's and i think that that's
the longevity that's the blue zone you
[SPEAKER_14]: know that's the that's the the ultimate
you know lift of the spirit i think coca
[SPEAKER_11]: leaf to cocaine is such a good example you
know coca leaf that is revered for
[SPEAKER_11]: thousands of years as one of the highest
grade pond appreciated plants across the
[SPEAKER_11]: andes you know is the divine leaf of
immortality you know and kind of the
[SPEAKER_11]: longevity of that is real you know and and
and how and how beautiful how much that
[SPEAKER_11]: medicine of a of a of a plant is you know
as opposed to the cursed kind of extracted
[SPEAKER_11]: way overused way overly kind of
self-gratifying way like ego building i
[SPEAKER_11]: mean it's it's totally different it's a
totally different thing those are not the
[SPEAKER_11]: same things at all yeah it's like um they
what like i've heard it described as um
[SPEAKER_11]: coca is to potato as cocaine is to vodka
right that's about right when i was
[SPEAKER_00]: married which was long ago i was married
to an andean man he was peruvian and and
[SPEAKER_00]: coca is actually symbiotic with their
bodies they they're one the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: their bodies are the same and lately i've
been thinking about um for example
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms because here i live in oakland
it's lee it's legalized here local and
[SPEAKER_00]: i've been doing microdoses so great but i
did a microdose and i didn't take time to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop my sentence setting in my mindset
because i've been doing it regular right
[SPEAKER_00]: and i was like oh i'll just do a microdose
and i did it on the fly it bit me in the
[SPEAKER_00]: butt so hard because that is a sacred
plant and you really have to watch your
[SPEAKER_00]: head space and you have to use it in a
certain way so i'm curious as we unveil
[SPEAKER_00]: these things how are people how many
people are going to get in trouble sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: physically or mentally not treating these
plants with the kind of respect like the
[SPEAKER_00]: andean peruvians do where they're
symbiotic with the coca plant that's part
[SPEAKER_00]: of their body and their whole life view
and the same with mushrooms that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: sacred plant that's that's not something
you take just like aspirin that is
[SPEAKER_03]: different every well they teach you right
finds out in our own way right you found
[SPEAKER_03]: out in your way oh i got my it's been a
while believe me the same way as they find
[SPEAKER_03]: out by eating cannabis you know start off
small and work your way up it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: something where you just is it i couldn't
believe it novice mistake i was thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm a professional 30 years doing this
what the hell and it got me but yeah it
[SPEAKER_00]: did get my brain wrapped around this kind
of sacred plant set and setting thing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot clearer so i was very appreciative for
the lesson i think people's definitions of
[SPEAKER_05]: a microdose is is is not all on the same
because like to me i hear people going
[SPEAKER_05]: well a microdose is like 0.1 and i'm like
0.1 hey like that's okay i guess i think
[SPEAKER_05]: you could catch a buzz off that though
like and other people are doing much
[SPEAKER_05]: smaller amounts so i think uh i think that
data needs to get put together so people
[SPEAKER_05]: can kind of all be on the same page what
is an accurate microdose because to me a
[SPEAKER_05]: microdose is there's no psychedelic effect
there's no like butterflies in your
[SPEAKER_05]: stomach there's no nothing you could
literally like honestly just go about your
[SPEAKER_05]: day but what you're talking about is like
something different the the old uh i
[SPEAKER_05]: thought i was a professional and now i'm
like how long is this going to be for
[SPEAKER_11]: again like you know i really appreciate
that thought actually too because that's
[SPEAKER_11]: one of you know within the within the
world of cannabis you know kind of when
[SPEAKER_11]: testing came along the biggest thing it
really helped to change and level the game
[SPEAKER_11]: up on was being able to start to get
towards a standardized dose especially
[SPEAKER_11]: when you're making manufactured products
or edibles or microdosing things you know
[SPEAKER_11]: because that's such a great point you know
kind of you know what was it a 0.1 or 0.2
[SPEAKER_11]: was it you know kind of a albino penis
envy or was it this other type variety you
[SPEAKER_11]: know and and so i think you know the the
identification of what even might i mean
[SPEAKER_11]: or just you know if there's an agreeance
on microdoses 0.1 you know it's like is
[SPEAKER_11]: that you know there's that can vary very
much between varieties you know and so so
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of yeah i think um you know cannabis
in such a way you know it's what's really
[SPEAKER_11]: cool just a random thought i've been
working on for a minute is you know
[SPEAKER_11]: everybody's freaking out like we're in the
apocalypse you know and and in the
[SPEAKER_11]: apocalypse the literal death mission of
the word is time of revelation or the
[SPEAKER_11]: great unveiling you know and and so many
ways i can't help but feel that plants are
[SPEAKER_11]: the horsemen of this apocalypse you know
with cannabis and hemp at the lead you
[SPEAKER_11]: know that are helping set the path forward
you know because you just see this rapid
[SPEAKER_11]: path of these other compounds and these
other plants and fungi kind of following
[SPEAKER_11]: lead in an accelerated way you know but
they're you know these plants and
[SPEAKER_11]: compounds and you know kind of companion
partner teacher plants you know that are
[SPEAKER_11]: helping to empower us with all the tools
we need to make it through this time of
[SPEAKER_11]: revelation you know in the most empowered
and lifted way towards this ascension path
[SPEAKER_08]: you know alec you really that's really
important and thank you for bringing that
[SPEAKER_08]: up because i think that there's something
you know we're trying to unwrap in the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis industry this discussion around
potency you know that we all know it's not
[SPEAKER_08]: just thc we know there's a whole
synergistic thing going but i feel like
[SPEAKER_08]: the the the missing conversation there is
the set and setting is endogenous means we
[SPEAKER_08]: think of set and setting is all these
things that are around us but it's how the
[SPEAKER_08]: things around us influence our own
internal chemistry right and certain
[SPEAKER_08]: certain certain certain cannabinoids and
certain compounds certain psychedelics and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff really stimulate our own i mean
anyone who's taken psychedelics knows that
[SPEAKER_08]: as soon as you it already starts right you
start building that up because you get
[SPEAKER_08]: into that anticipation and the same thing
with cannabis there's certain cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: varieties that stimulate your endogenous
chemical factory and they interact like i
[SPEAKER_08]: feel like there's these three intersecting
lines of cannabinoids terpenes and
[SPEAKER_08]: endogenous compounds and where they
intersect is where the potency lies and a
[SPEAKER_08]: big part of that is knowing like hey
there's a certain set and setting that is
[SPEAKER_08]: going to react to these particular
chemicals and create this other high and
[SPEAKER_08]: now that we're in the the pandemic the set
and setting has changed so much and for me
[SPEAKER_08]: in my life my set and setting around
cannabis completely shifted because for
[SPEAKER_08]: one i'm not with my homies anymore i'm in
my home office with my family on the other
[SPEAKER_08]: side of the wall you know it's a totally
different relationship with the same plant
[SPEAKER_08]: and i think that there's something there
that there's certain varieties that really
[SPEAKER_08]: trigger anxiety and certain people if
their set and setting isn't right you know
[SPEAKER_08]: but at the same time those same varieties
are the ones that are stimulate that
[SPEAKER_08]: intense psychoactive experience if your
set and setting is right and people have
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of steered away from those varieties
because they don't want to take the chance
[SPEAKER_08]: of having a adverse reaction where they
need to really you know that's like riding
[SPEAKER_08]: that razor's edge of where you're the
chemicals outside and the chemicals inside
[SPEAKER_08]: are in complete harmony that's that whole
human plant experience that's really
[SPEAKER_12]: brilliant to be honest there is no one
potency because some people oh sorry some
[SPEAKER_12]: people think potency is physical some
people think it's mental so there is no
[SPEAKER_12]: one potency any more than there's one
cannabis for everybody there isn't it's i
[SPEAKER_12]: mean there can be things that people
perform prefer and a lot of people prefer
[SPEAKER_03]: very different things the most miscommon
ask people reach out to me for
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically when looking for something
medicinal is they're looking for a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis that works specifically for their
issue it is still a dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: misinformation that's being perpetuated
because when i make them aware that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: completely subjective and what if you and
i can have the same condition what works
[SPEAKER_03]: for you won't work for me and vice versa
that's mind-blowing to them they can't
[SPEAKER_03]: understand that we have to go along the
same process of trial and error for you to
[SPEAKER_03]: find out what works for you there's no
magic one of sam and all those guys have
[SPEAKER_03]: not created that one magic asthma bud the
one cancer that's the one thing what's
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically for this cancer that i could
use and the most frustrating thing that i
[SPEAKER_03]: have to tell them is we don't know we
don't understand you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_03]: try it by trial and error document and i
have them definitely write it down in a
[SPEAKER_03]: notebook and you know document how they
feel when they take it you know what did
[SPEAKER_03]: they eat what were they feeling one was on
set and when did it finish so that later
[SPEAKER_03]: on they can get it because they're in the
experience later they need to understand
[SPEAKER_03]: or their caretaker or person working with
them or their doctor is very helpful to
[SPEAKER_03]: take that information so they can show
what you're using how much you're using
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're using it for how much dosage
and how much is and how long is it lasting
[SPEAKER_03]: for those are all very helpful and all
decision makers that you find in what
[SPEAKER_03]: works for you so i agree that psychedelics
are just as subjective as cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: what would work for debbie for a microdose
could be a potential heroic dose for
[SPEAKER_03]: someone else and a microdose from else
turns out to be a heroic dose for debbie
[SPEAKER_03]: so you know it's it's still rather
fascinating but the most frustrating thing
[SPEAKER_03]: to say is even after all this and honestly
is we don't know and i think that what you
[SPEAKER_01]: were just saying and also alec is that
this has always been known because even
[SPEAKER_01]: when you go to traditional people that
dish out the medicine that prepare the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine for you they hold the space they
clear the energy they collect they cast
[SPEAKER_01]: the spell all of that is protection for
your spirit it's protection for with this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant so they're they're creating a space
for you to be able to have a safe
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship you know for lack of better
words they're creating soft padding so
[SPEAKER_01]: that your relationship and and and they
create a mediation so the epigenetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: and the situation and they cast and and
the set and setting is just all a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: that same thing that we talk about the
ancient settings of casting a spell and
[SPEAKER_14]: maria mexico and look up maria sabina for
as one person who's done amazing work with
[SPEAKER_14]: uh with you know cubensis and and palanque
in that whole zone um also just you know
[SPEAKER_14]: compounding medicines is really crucial
and i think with with microdosing
[SPEAKER_14]: especially you know it's the it's the
compounding uh psychedelic you know the
[SPEAKER_14]: mushroom with other supportive herbs in a
capsule form you know so that you can kind
[SPEAKER_14]: of say oh i'm going to take the same
amount of capsule with all these other
[SPEAKER_14]: supportive herbs so that my liver is not
too toxed out if i'm going to take it you
[SPEAKER_14]: know for a whole year or you know the
kidneys setting which is the is the
[SPEAKER_01]: protection as well you want to be able to
look towards not only the elders who have
[SPEAKER_01]: held the medicine but also the elder the
elder herbs who have also been compounded
[SPEAKER_01]: together forever and ever they also help
hold the set and setting of what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: taking to create more of a protection of
you having a relationship with that planet
[SPEAKER_11]: i i really appreciate that um you know
something i'd love to add in kind of which
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a good conversation you know kind of
ties both of these topics in with what you
[SPEAKER_11]: were bringing up mojave kind of about that
like the endogenous lead up to the kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: overall potency of an experience you know
because it's so true across kind of plants
[SPEAKER_11]: and kind of the you know the traditions
we're using these contexts that we're
[SPEAKER_11]: using these plants and and you know to
debbie your point of kind of you know just
[SPEAKER_11]: this that experience you know kind of uh
you know it's you know just using cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: as an example you know it's fascinating
because um um you know like you know i'm a
[SPEAKER_11]: veteran in the navy at tn i know you're a
veteran too but as you saw um you know
[SPEAKER_11]: i've worked with a lot of veterans over
the years uh to help kind of reframe their
[SPEAKER_11]: experience with cannabis you know because
you know there's this thing that can
[SPEAKER_11]: happen if you don't come to cannabis
correct it can slap you in a way that
[SPEAKER_11]: you'll create such a negative response
that you might not ever do it again and so
[SPEAKER_11]: there's a lot of people that are first
time users that you know take some long
[SPEAKER_11]: break in between that start back uh or
people that kind of one day just shifts
[SPEAKER_11]: from taking way too big of a dose but it's
kind of a respect and kind of set and
[SPEAKER_11]: setting type factor but it'll create a
super negative reaction that you know you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of leads to this oh it's maybe
it's not for me anymore you know and and
[SPEAKER_11]: you hear all these different people that
say oh the cannabis these are so strong
[SPEAKER_06]: it's it's
[SPEAKER_11]: and part of it is you know kind of
immediately start microdosing thc and you
[SPEAKER_11]: know having really elevated levels of cbd
or say cbg or something but then it's it's
[SPEAKER_11]: the whole kind of the the ritual of like
taking a bud and grinding it up and you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of you know going through the
process of rolling it you know and
[SPEAKER_11]: starting kind of almost set your
endogenous path kind of forward with it
[SPEAKER_11]: and you know kind of then you know kind of
taking that you know that you rolled
[SPEAKER_11]: ritually in that way or whatever the
ritual is that you do with it but it's
[SPEAKER_11]: putting the intention into in that way and
then it's doing something that's
[SPEAKER_11]: associatively pleasurable you know like
going and eating uh your favorite dessert
[SPEAKER_11]: or going on a walk with your sweetie or
going kind of you know out in the water or
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever it is that you know you like but
you know and then over time with cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: you know kind of from this protocol you
know you can kind of over time you know
[SPEAKER_11]: like keeping this ritual going you know
the same process you know kind of over
[SPEAKER_11]: time you can start oh eventually titrating
slowly titrating up your thc that's in
[SPEAKER_11]: that blend um and then all of a sudden
you're able to puff tough with the the
[SPEAKER_11]: best of them you know like and start to
really re shift your experience with
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis to appreciate and enjoy thc and
all the medicine it brings you know and
[SPEAKER_11]: and so i think kind of there's that's such
a big process with you know how we're you
[SPEAKER_11]: know it's like i used to do a lot of bud
tether educational seminars at retail
[SPEAKER_11]: dispensaries and i would almost like i try
to lecture them about like you know how
[SPEAKER_11]: how sacred of a role an activist to be
able to be this person to help share this
[SPEAKER_11]: experience with somebody that's new that's
never done it before and how if you do
[SPEAKER_11]: that wrong that could be on your karma you
know because you might have like just
[SPEAKER_11]: dabbed out that old lady or like just
blasted them on that like sheba chew
[SPEAKER_11]: thousand milligram edible you know that
they might not ever smoke cannabis because
[SPEAKER_11]: again you know it might have been in their
destiny to heal their cannabis cancer with
[SPEAKER_11]: this plant that you just did that dude you
know to take that responsibly and so so
[SPEAKER_11]: just like kind of that understanding with
canvas i think goes triple so with kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: all these like new kind of emerging in
[SPEAKER_11]: these plants and and y'all just not taking
it i mean taking it not taking for granted
[SPEAKER_11]: and taking it seriously just and you know
how we do it and just the reverence we do
[SPEAKER_11]: it in and just knowing you know what we're
doing it yeah happy belated armistice day
[SPEAKER_03]: to you i don't consider it veteran's day
because that's more propaganda for the
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial military complex but like they
belated respect but with the veterans that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're working with uh we all consider
cannabis our daily palliative because you
[SPEAKER_03]: know we have a daily acclimatization to it
and after 30 days arriving at regular
[SPEAKER_03]: cognitive levels whereas we see
psychedelics and mushroom as the next
[SPEAKER_03]: front for our veterans to really hit at
the deep issues even micro dosing and
[SPEAKER_03]: working with therapists and psychologists
to work through their post-traumatic
[SPEAKER_03]: stress injury it's no longer ptsd people
it's that's considered post-traumatic
[SPEAKER_03]: stress damage it is an injury so that's
why it's called ptsi now so that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: realize that we can heal past these
injuries once we have the proper tools and
[SPEAKER_03]: tool sets in mind and we're finding a lot
of psychologists willing to now step over
[SPEAKER_03]: that line to work with psychedelics to
help a lot of these people access their
[SPEAKER_03]: deeper traumas through psychedelics so
it's a new and beautiful frontier so if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're out there in psychology now look
into this new uh front so that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: educate yourself and become one of those
therapists because there's millions of
[SPEAKER_03]: people who need psychedelic healing not
just our veterans we're just a small
[SPEAKER_03]: subset or trying to prove fact as the
culture that we are and we are
[SPEAKER_03]: establishing that and we're doing so so
that the larger society at general can
[SPEAKER_05]: benefit from it much love i love it
