[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
and welcome to today's episode which will
[SPEAKER_04]: be an unboxing video This was already
open.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna lie, but yeah I am going to
be showing you guys today some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: works that have been coming out from the
maple butter boys out east and Quebec hung
[SPEAKER_04]: out with these guys at the Karma Cup they
shared a booth with me and I really you
[SPEAKER_04]: know as bubble man as someone who's been
focused on extra And hash making for the
[SPEAKER_04]: last 20 years I'm always looking for the
new up-and-coming artists the people who
[SPEAKER_04]: are really pushing boundaries and actually
just crushing the game with Superb quality
[SPEAKER_04]: and it really starts with growing and so
these guys have incredible grows I'll show
[SPEAKER_04]: you some of their plants Upcoming here,
and they're really starting to make some
[SPEAKER_04]: nice product mostly rosin right now,
but it really is as their little little
[SPEAKER_04]: logo says maple butter Quebec craft rosin
so here is my little package that I
[SPEAKER_04]: ordered up and Pretty reasonable prices
you got about 60 bucks between 60 and 70
[SPEAKER_04]: for a gram of really incredible rosin You
absolutely will not be sorry a perfect
[SPEAKER_04]: little droplets into each container and
you can see There's the Rockstar Kush just
[SPEAKER_04]: white and beautiful and just looking like
you want to devour it and then I got a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of headbanger dry sift rosins and
One special one that I actually already
[SPEAKER_04]: puffed which is $60 a half gram It's the
viper dry sift rosin if you can get it get
[SPEAKER_04]: in touch with maple butter Their email
simply put across the screen there maple
[SPEAKER_04]: butter at protonmail.com And I'm really
excited to get into this I got myself my
[SPEAKER_04]: Faberg√© egg plugged into the D nail at 610
and then I've got myself the Klein With
[SPEAKER_04]: the mega pot and starting to get a little
chaz, but you know what she still tastes
[SPEAKER_04]: As good as good can be so I guess without
any further ado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do a little review on the maple
butter boys oh Yeah Very very happy with
[SPEAKER_04]: this let me tell you money well spent so I
guess It's hard to really think of which I
[SPEAKER_04]: should smoke first, but I guess I'll just
pull them out as they come out We'll go
[SPEAKER_04]: with some Rockstar Kush and see if I can't
just give you guys a little a little
[SPEAKER_02]: close-up on that because it's so pretty It
is so pretty Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Definitely tasty definitely stoked on
the maple butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Yeah, so I Guess the one thing I'm
missing is some q-tips for the silicone
[SPEAKER_04]: carbide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't we take the first rip?
[SPEAKER_04]: off of The torch we'll turn the timer on
Because it's always nice to have that
[SPEAKER_04]: timer on I've mentioned it before I like
to do 20 seconds heat up and about a 55
[SPEAKER_04]: second cool down All
[SPEAKER_04]: right 20 seconds on the cool down do a
quick reset and we'll go for 55 seconds
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost hard to put the first dabber into
this perfect little Medallion oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus Don't go too big you got a few more
flavors to try Because that nice it just
[SPEAKER_04]: wants to pull so much out And I've got
quite a few more to hit so we're just
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna be hitting reasonable size dabs the
flavor on the Rockstar right off the bat
[SPEAKER_04]: Without even tasting it the smell profile
is incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like it came out of Remos garden
Mmm gonna have to puff some of that with
[SPEAKER_04]: Remo in fact The old wrist tech to tell
how hot your quartz is for me It's always
[SPEAKER_04]: been accurate with the mothership mega
pots and less accurate with other quartz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure why that is Let's give it a
go
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow You know, it's really hard to put that
subtle nuance of what makes resin nice
[SPEAKER_04]: versus resin that's not nice The
smoothness of that was like Cream very
[SPEAKER_04]: reminiscent of how it photographs
reminiscent of how it picked up off the
[SPEAKER_04]: dabber Just creamy perfection So my q-tips
and a tiny little bit of my DC glass
[SPEAKER_04]: cleaner has It's not always necessary when
I get the perfect perfect temp rip like
[SPEAKER_04]: that It cleans so perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually when it gets a little Bit too
hot and I get near the chas.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when you really require to use the
DC glass cleaner Well, I'll tell you
[SPEAKER_04]: something about that right there I can
puff that really fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so damn enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's strong it's definitely that indica
that narrow leaf or sorry wide leaf drug
[SPEAKER_04]: called to bar and What can I say more
about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean the taste is very full.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can still taste it in my throat pretty
pretty Pretty on point gonna have to give
[SPEAKER_04]: that one a pretty high mark If you're
thinking about the Rockstar Kush I Got to
[SPEAKER_04]: give it a couple of thumbs up Let's move
right along.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shall we think we're gonna hit the next
dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: Off the egg All right, we'll put the
client over here Put the all of this stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't put your dabber down on the table
You'll get rosin on it I'm always picking
[SPEAKER_04]: up little bits of oil and rubbing it into
my skin How many of you guys do that out
[SPEAKER_04]: there where you just have a little bit of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Reclaim or droplets of resin from your
pipe or even a little rosin from your
[SPEAKER_04]: dabber that's hit your table I just rub it
right into my skin I love the smell that
[SPEAKER_04]: it gives me afterwards and once it's
gotten to a point where it's no longer
[SPEAKER_04]: sticky and it's been absorbed into my skin
I Just feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right back into the beeman bag here
Get these open and see what wonderful
[SPEAKER_04]: things we have here so head banger to Dry
sift rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so they've dry sifted this head
banger Looks quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I'm gonna show pictures But the
Johnny B and me wants to bring it right up
[SPEAKER_04]: to the camera and show it to you there as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is The banger boom,
all right So Let us Get right in wonderful
[SPEAKER_04]: thing about the d-mail D-mail it's already
at temperature There's no need for me to
[SPEAKER_04]: torch anything and wait 20 seconds and
this that the other thing that being said
[SPEAKER_04]: I get such enjoyment from this system of
motherships this dial system with the
[SPEAKER_04]: little quartz You know the mega pot that
goes up and down and they're the the way
[SPEAKER_04]: that it carbs I really gotta say it's
probably one of my favorite systems this
[SPEAKER_04]: Gains favoritism for a whole variety of
different reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about how awesome it hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although the D-mail does hit great It's
more about the convenience and being able
[SPEAKER_04]: to plug it in not have to go through gas
Not have to have a torch not have to worry
[SPEAKER_04]: about any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's It definitely they both have their
pros and their cons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is more cake batter just looking
Beautiful color on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to go in now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember we are on headbanger two dry sift
rosin
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was intense it was a very
intense hit Wow, that's uh, what a perfect
[SPEAKER_04]: name for that That was like getting my
head banged nothing a joke it was almost
[SPEAKER_04]: like a triple ricochet ding ding ding
Almost gave me a Almost got me a little
[SPEAKER_04]: dizzy Wow props to the maple butter boys
On this one not that the Rockstar Kush
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like dessert But this headbanger is
like a four course meal right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like you're done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me You do not require To hit ten
more rips after this one, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: wonderful because As much as I enjoy
puffing as much as I enjoy, you know the
[SPEAKER_04]: ritual of a pipe and inhaling vapor I also
am It's nice to be free of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to be able to get along with
your day Be able to have a quick rip and
[SPEAKER_04]: move on and go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a quick moment in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not this Sitting at the table and
sessioning for an hour or two straight,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong On its own in its own,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But in everyday life when you're busy and
you're active and you got to get out and
[SPEAKER_04]: you got to keep going It's just so nice to
be able to have these quick little rips
[SPEAKER_04]: the way these pipes offer it All right So
we just hit headbanger to dry sip rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one is also headbanger to dry sip
rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got two of those ones So the two that
we have left are the headbanger for dry
[SPEAKER_04]: sip rosin and the Trim bin dry sip rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I might go in for the trim bin
just to separate it Got a real nice nose
[SPEAKER_04]: to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost want to say some viper might have
ended up in there These guys do a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: host of wonderful cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if they're gonna be making
their flowers available I think they're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna be really sticking to the
concentrates, but we'll see in the near
[SPEAKER_04]: future if people are willing to Pay the
price for the flowers, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe I mean I certainly was I was very
happy to have gotten these two buds of
[SPEAKER_04]: where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually gonna be squishing those I
don't know if that's gonna be in part two
[SPEAKER_04]: of this video because it seems like it
should be its own video Or if it'll be at
[SPEAKER_04]: the end of this video either way It's
content that I want to share with you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: the last time we squished where is my bike
it came out at a damn near 30% I think it
[SPEAKER_04]: was 28 29% return and This is what I've
heard about this one as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty sweet to buy a nug and
Realize that what you're getting is is 28
[SPEAKER_04]: to 30 percent cannabinoids on that on that
flower So alright without further ado
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go in for some trim bin dry sift
rosin All right trim bin
[SPEAKER_04]: Yummy Yummy
[SPEAKER_04]: and it just keeps hitting It just keeps
hitting oh my goodness You know another
[SPEAKER_04]: cool thing about maple butter is that
they've been purchasing bubble man pants
[SPEAKER_04]: wholesale And producing their own sauces
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually don't have any of their sauces
here Probably gonna get some in the near
[SPEAKER_04]: future But yeah, they do Blue River
terpenes mixed with these rosins and then
[SPEAKER_04]: they fill it into the the bubble man pens
and It was quite nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sold quite a few of them at the Karma
Cup standing at the booth there I was
[SPEAKER_04]: watching them go through their rosin like
it was on fire and yeah, it was cool You
[SPEAKER_04]: know to see the pens get filled with
product and to hear the feedback of people
[SPEAKER_04]: very specific pen Really does need
sometimes a walkthrough often people think
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not working when it is at the same
time is are there Warranties to be had
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a new product.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to make it the best that we
can but Sometimes, you know getting it out
[SPEAKER_04]: onto the market is the best way to move it
forward So for those of you that had any
[SPEAKER_04]: problems with yours, please bear with us
and have patience We're gonna make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that you are not left holding the short
stick in that relationship So please don't
[SPEAKER_04]: feel at any point in time that that's how
it's gonna be In the meantime,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I have one more rosin to go
through and it's one of those headbangers
[SPEAKER_04]: my goodness So we did the head banger too
Yeah, we did those but we did not do is
[SPEAKER_04]: the head banger for dry sift rosin Mmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that's serious product You know
when you see the head banger plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I can show you right here You know
right away that the rosin is going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, something like this right here
Ridiculous, but true All right Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy to break into these rosins.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so They're so smooth and the rosin
doesn't seem to leave much behind when you
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we froze up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I was saying was that it was so
smooth And that it doesn't leave a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit much rosin behind on the glass and I
really like that So yeah, my camera froze
[SPEAKER_04]: up there and paused right out on me so I
guess we better get this last rip down
[SPEAKER_04]: without further ado and Yeah props maple
butter boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give thanks maple butter Maple butter
underscore rosin that's the Instagram and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's kwebek kwebek craft rosin Yeah,
I keep calling them the maple butter boys,
[SPEAKER_04]: but really The company is called maple
butter and I should probably reiterate
[SPEAKER_04]: that a couple more times but yet You know
the guys who are running it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna call them the maple butter boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, give thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hit this
[SPEAKER_04]: Those headbangers are noticeable head
ringers
[SPEAKER_04]: I Feel like this video has been mostly
just me coughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I don't spend As much time
coughing in my videos as I have today
[SPEAKER_04]: Apologies for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one wants to listen to someone cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I don't want to anyway,
so Try to keep that down to a minimum,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'll tell you when you're hitting
maple butter Shits turp rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard not to cough For real I cough
for me as I hit things in the 10 plus
[SPEAKER_04]: percent range of terpenes As I grew up on
things that were in the one to three
[SPEAKER_04]: percent range and as I grew Through the
one to three Into the four to five into
[SPEAKER_04]: the six to seven and all the way into the
ten plus You know, I feel that a five to
[SPEAKER_04]: seven is pretty awesome for me And I quite
enjoy some threes and some fours and some
[SPEAKER_04]: fives as long as it's not a one,
you know Then it's just Lacking loudness
[SPEAKER_04]: completely and it's very low percentage 1%
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's extremely low But I would say it's
definitely average for what most people
[SPEAKER_04]: are producing unfortunately Well,
if you are unable to produce for yourself
[SPEAKER_04]: or you're currently not producing fire of
this quality The beautiful thing about
[SPEAKER_04]: this the beautiful thing about Canada's
civil disobedience while LPs are unable to
[SPEAKER_04]: fulfill people's desires and urges and
needs For that matter for wine products
[SPEAKER_04]: like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are unable to do it Certain people
are willing to practice a level of civil
[SPEAKER_04]: disobedience and to make this medicine
available So to all of those people doing
[SPEAKER_04]: that from the dispensary owners to the
growers who produce conscious chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: free organic medicine for the sick To all
of you making this medicine available
[SPEAKER_04]: through civil disobedience, which is how
we got the dispensary So are the LPs here
[SPEAKER_04]: in Canada in the first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means licensed producers For you
watching outside of Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the only legal people in Canada
who can grow and Distribute sell through
[SPEAKER_04]: the mail and whatnot legally so in the
meantime while while their hands are tied
[SPEAKER_04]: and they are unable to Risk losing their
license to fulfill their patients needs
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll have people like maple butter So
check them out guys maple butter
[SPEAKER_04]: underscore rosin and the email is maple
butter at protonmail.com That's what I
[SPEAKER_04]: did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just emailed Those guys asked what was
around and yeah was excited Where's my
[SPEAKER_04]: bike though if that is on the menu that
one is my personal favorite It wasn't so
