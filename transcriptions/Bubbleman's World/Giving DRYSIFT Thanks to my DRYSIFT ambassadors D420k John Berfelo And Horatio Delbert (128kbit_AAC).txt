[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and well, geez, today I feel like I'm Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my new hat and my new shirt from Kim
and Aaron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did do a little video that I'll be
uploading here soon in regards to the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that you sent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really appreciate the shwag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even call it shwag because really
it should be called full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full melt outerwear by DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super stoked on the work that you guys are
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unity in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I thought I would just do a short
little video here with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some unbelievably beautiful dry
sifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really has paid off sharing all this
information with my friends from D420K to
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny Burfalo to Horatio Delbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between those three guys they are
basically my dry sift ambassadors right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really taking it to the next
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course Horatio will always be the LHO
guy but he's a smart enough cookie to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that if he's gonna really know what he's
dealing with from the start to the finish
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's important that he acquires an
unadulterated cannabinoid profile and what
[SPEAKER_00]: better way to do that than through the
wonderful mechanical separations of screen
[SPEAKER_00]: sifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what I've got here is I've got the
Jamaican, the lamb's bread from Johnny B
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're gonna start it out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made such a small amount and you gave
it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes to show you're such a super,
super human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky to call you my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you out there that don't know
about Johnny B, go check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420Weedmaster on Instagram, John H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burfalo on Facebook, and John Burfalo on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna hit the Jamaican lamb's bread
that I brought back in 1995 after being
[SPEAKER_00]: married in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give thanks Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give thanks Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and creamy on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some of these glass pieces out of the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: My new quartz banger from Gabinator and my
new 16 mil nail as well as a male to male
[SPEAKER_00]: so it can fit the female on my piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't even really express how different of
a flavor that Jamaican is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to pay a little bit more
attention to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a ton of it but it seems like
one that would take a couple of weeks to
[SPEAKER_00]: really get used to the subtle differences
of the flavors and the highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also wondered because it doesn't
taste exactly what it tasted like in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica and I have a feeling that it's
that tropical sun-grown sativa that hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been able to produce the same terpene
profile grown under lights, although I
[SPEAKER_00]: will say John did an exceptional job.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin is really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn near white.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna go, we've hit the quartz
puking bee bowl with the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got the D-nail whip with their
brand new sick, which is the silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: carbide nail and I've got it in my
straight fab and it's actually plugged
[SPEAKER_00]: into the new nail, the Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what we're gonna try on this
one is some of Horatio's new live sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, you seen this guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Live sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen it here first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is dry sift that he has added
terpenes to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got quite a photo of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not show it in this particular
video but it will get shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really interesting, it almost looks like
Giddy-up's live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's wet almost or
crystallized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buttery, it looks very buttery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you the taste on it,
especially off the silicon carbide nail,
[SPEAKER_00]: is absolutely tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go with a little, I guess seven
star as Horatio calls it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call it the sift, the terp sift,
which is what we called it in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: when Tony and I made the first batch ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Horatio's got his own vibes and he's
really thinking that the seven star is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So props to you Horatio, I respect your
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag seven star going down right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the flavor on that is absolutely,
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: How strong and deep and plant mattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in a bad way plant mattery but in a
good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about it with Horatio the other
day, the taste that I get is almost fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: squeezed carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the background of the
flavor and I suspect that's the intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: of the added terpenes producing a taste
that would otherwise not be that strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: might not pick up the carrots smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you when you get it that
concentrated, you can really taste that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost like cannabis carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta love guys like Tony and Horatio who
really put their thoughts into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really put their minds forward and
they love to pioneer things and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's an accident that all of us have
come together here in the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the straight fab, we've got the
fab egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what number three are we gonna hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta represent D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: D420K probably the most generous dry sift
kick down I've ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had some pretty nice ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing compared to what Dee brought me
the last time that he was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of hard work to make this
sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of value once you get it and to just
give it away the way D420K did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to thank you for being such a
great friend dude and I appreciate you
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the dry sift general and you're
moving things forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a big part of the team and you know
go follow D420K at on Facebook
[SPEAKER_00]: D-F-O-U-R-T-W-E-N-T-Y-K.
[SPEAKER_00]: D420K but he spells it the four and the 20
out between the D and the K.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check them out at D420K on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can check them out at D420K on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go give him some subscriptions and some
follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a kick ass guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my friends are kick ass guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really just can't say enough good about
John Horatio D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I gotta kick it down to Flav and
Ro for hooking me up with the amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: glass that they've hooked me up over the
course of the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course shout out to the guys at
D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have been an absolute pleasure to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't do what I do without you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you guys to realize I'm not
just promoting D-Nail because I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a product that everyone should use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promote it because I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine not having it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with the gift of the Dabinator
from Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridiculously kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany representing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a unit now that I can take with a
cord to Europe and not worry about blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my North American units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to finish it off with the D420K
Dry Sift Full Mount New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super orange flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hit that right off the
Puking Bee Quartz Bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you in the next one.
