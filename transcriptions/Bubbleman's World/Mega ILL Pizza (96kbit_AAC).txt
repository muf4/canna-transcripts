people's minds Yeah, and so yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is the minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that pizza.

[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so you guys made the sauce?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, everything I think about everything
we make here That's real right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: You look at that.

[SPEAKER_06]: That's the real deal Some people will be
like, oh get rid of that chunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what lets you know, it's real Yeah,
that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotta make it taste good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh right off the bat, when do you see
that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, people are getting away from
actually the real pizza, you know Or the
[SPEAKER_07]: just the concept of cooking all in
together, you know, I mean, everything's
[SPEAKER_07]: got to be squished and out of a container
nowadays, you know It's not right No,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's nice to have the passion of just the
very thing you're doing right now is
[SPEAKER_06]: almost an art form in a meditative
process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah You're putting energy into the pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: It puts my knee into Zen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying Well, it's because
it is you can tell it's a meditative
[SPEAKER_06]: process from the needing to the It's
really kind of like art like you just
[SPEAKER_06]: created your canvas and then you painted
it and then you added texture It's pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like art.
[SPEAKER_06]: Way better than art.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's technical art.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we got there?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's caramelized onions.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's caramelized onions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna say, holy Killer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stoked to be here at the mega ill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely digging it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a cool concept, you know,
like we've really come a long way in our
[SPEAKER_06]: view on cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always dreamed of a day where alcohol
and tobacco weren't the main focuses of a
[SPEAKER_06]: food industries, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hope it doesn't go too commercial,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there an aspect of it will but as
long as they allow us to have our our
[SPEAKER_06]: other levels, then I won't have a problem
with their commercialism.
[SPEAKER_06]: Commercialism will always feed the masses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the masses need to be fed too,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So but for those that choose and this
would be better to feed a bunch of masses
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just did a preview.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta go watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love olives.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love olives.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kale.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll look you up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_07]: The Rambo or which one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one did I get?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a Frabie's.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Frabie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: He makes those medcans.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: He makes the medcans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the medcan or medgate or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a tribute to my ex.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plain Jane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which she's nothing like.
[SPEAKER_06]: So John, tell us what we just saw in the
news.
[SPEAKER_06]: The little clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little clip?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it says, um, legal grower or
criminal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually did a little interview with
TTV News.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, not little, huge interviews with
TTV News yesterday for about three hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my story's coming on in about 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way they just progress that with
legal or criminal is well, I'm not ready
[SPEAKER_03]: to show what a legal grower does with how
he produces medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool, but I'm nervous too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to come on here soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one did you get?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the Rambo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy men.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got the Plain Jane.
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks just perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: That Plain Jane doesn't look Plain Jane.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I love about the Plain Jane
and even yours is the hash in between
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now John Ruffalo has a license to do
it legally, but as of April 1st,
[SPEAKER_00]: production will be shifted from small
growers to large commercial operations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Former construction worker John Ruffalo
has had a license from Health Canada for
[SPEAKER_08]: his personal grow-up for repairs.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's on a disability pension after a fall
on a construction site nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: From our side, his body is riddled with
broken bones.
[SPEAKER_08]: They healed, but nerve damage remains.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's in constant pain and allergic to
pharmaceutical painkillers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marijuana allows him to function.
[SPEAKER_08]: One pump is on all needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pain is like bam, bam, bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis and supplements,
it's like... It's still there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not as hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's created his own particular strains,
perfected for his particular pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming from first, federal regulations
will limit legal production to a handful
[SPEAKER_08]: of industrial-sized growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll only be producing a limited number
of strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: No edibles, oils, or creams at a price
that's four or five times higher.
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, it's all about finding exactly
what it takes for me to function that we
[SPEAKER_08]: all have.
[SPEAKER_08]: I spent years researching this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now the government wants to take it
all away.
[SPEAKER_08]: That must make you a ribbon man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little scared.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm scared.
I'm like, what am I going to do?
When health care is a real drop in the
bucket.
An Oxford lawyer, John Conway,
is trying to help her fellow and the other
[SPEAKER_08]: 17,000 licensed personal pot growers in D
.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: by suing the federal government.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more than just affordability.
[SPEAKER_08]: Affordability is a huge barrier to letting
them study.
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, the control of your own
medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: What does the information sell on?
[SPEAKER_08]: Conway says the new rules ignore a
citizen's constitutional right to
[SPEAKER_08]: reasonable access to the medicine they
need.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great, John, really.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was totally a great story.
[SPEAKER_06]: You did great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love your telling them I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not mad, I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little scared how they're going to
cover that, but I think they covered it as
[SPEAKER_06]: well as they possibly could.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did it with the cut to Conroy and
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, tricking us with the
designated driver story, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that pizza was so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is some dafts.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little D420K to the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some 99% bland head dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the OG cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: And luckily, the D-Nail is always ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, really, what is better than eating
great pizza in a good environment and then
[SPEAKER_06]: taking a rip of your favorite whatever it
is you're puffing on?
[SPEAKER_06]: I am sold on mega ill.
[SPEAKER_06]: The food's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stoked on the people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can smoke my hash here.
[SPEAKER_06]: With no judgment.
[SPEAKER_06]: No judgment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So John just hit the My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was the Chicamist River
Bubble Hash that we made a few episodes
[SPEAKER_06]: back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to give Anthony, the
cameraman, a rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give him the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can ninja him the My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, ninja.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll take the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the organic ninja head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dry sift just went.
[SPEAKER_01]: It melted and knocked my hand out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bubble just came back suddenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: So Anthony is often doing camera work for
the weed guy, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kush.ca.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Kush.ca.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today he's here at mega ill,
as he often is, and just helping us out
[SPEAKER_06]: with some camera work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: To the cameraman.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: A cameraman's always down for a rep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to Go Big.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I made you Go Big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, don't forget that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now he's like, no, it's your turn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank you for making me Go Big.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the kind of dessert I love.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we're done yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's the barb dry sift that I
cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Barb is shish kebari crossed with an
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is absolutely splendidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This right here would be like a hurt
someone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's why you're just taking it for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys up for a rip on the D now?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always nicer when you're sharing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, this is the barb Afghani shish
kebari cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bubble up nicely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be able to get you a little light in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Barb's bubbling away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Delicious.
Delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Burn off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go for a fresh one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a hash?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: So no water, no chemicals, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just screen sifted resin.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The D now is kind of like learning to hit
a whole new way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really a quick blast,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more like a slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost my breath quicker than anything,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's so slow too sometimes,
like the residual smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still there for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And usually I have a carb cap that I'll
put over the quartz.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little quartz carb cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ready for another flavor, John?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you waiting on, guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or are you ready for more pizza?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking dessert.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dessert.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dessert's on the house today, boys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's get the dessert.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you hitting for yourself?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's also barb.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what'd I bring?
[SPEAKER_06]: Barb, barb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet cigar.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all stuck together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of peel some off there.
[SPEAKER_06]: First bounce.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to want to hit that,
John.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that really strong push.
[SPEAKER_06]: After?
[SPEAKER_06]: After what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let you take your own mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is some dry stuff that you
bounced?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first bounce of My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, never a bad thing to have these fun
flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Baked, full, content, stoked on John's new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we're going to continue to puff
and we'll be back with dessert.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the twice baked cheesecake with
blueberry compote.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one is an organic apple crumble
with vanilla ice cream and maple bacon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've both been sprinkled with hemp
hearts.
[SPEAKER_05]: With hemp hearts and a little drizzle of
vegan coconut chocolate syrup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can puff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go vegetarian first.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll clean a few bacons off.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just the bacon.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only bacon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll just have a puff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be my ice cream.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I don't eat bacon, but I will
still eat this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Patience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Must get the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Baller desserts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Baller pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bong reps in house.
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt so good walking in here with my
rig knowing that I could set it up on the
[SPEAKER_06]: table and just enjoy myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so, so killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing is like ice cream cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just not quite frozen, but just as
cold as you could be without being frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives the most perfect texture to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the crumble crust there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to grab some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, wow, that looks so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have some right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're doing it right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give Megahill two thumbs up
on atmosphere, quality of the food and
[SPEAKER_06]: desserts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just all around fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoking hash at the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like this new world we're living in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today was a little bit of out and
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Double dessert.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got good properties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Particularly with both of these desserts
on my palate as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dessert hash for dessert.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be argued that there are better
hashes to smoke during a meal as opposed
[SPEAKER_06]: to the desserts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find a kush, a deep heavy hash to be
more of a meal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes this one in particular,
it's just so tasty and got such a good
[SPEAKER_06]: head to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like it's a dessert.
[SPEAKER_06]: We said that quite a while ago too.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys are in or around Vancouver,
I definitely suggest that you come check
[SPEAKER_06]: out Megahill down on 682 Kingsway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what we're at?
[SPEAKER_06]: 646.
[SPEAKER_06]: 646.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said it earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 646 Kingsway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring your own stash.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not selling you anything here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Find desserts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Find pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you forget your papers,
they're going to be open in a head shop
[SPEAKER_06]: next door.
[SPEAKER_06]: So come check it out, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Old man certified.
[SPEAKER_06]: Side note.
[SPEAKER_06]: Side note.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just noticed now there's no water in the
mothership.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been puffing out of it for the last
hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I literally just noticed now when I
went over to the sink to dump the water
[SPEAKER_06]: and none came out that there was none in
the pipe the whole time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably you guys have noticed when we
were puffing that you were probably
[SPEAKER_06]: wondering why are those guys why didn't
they put water in the pipe?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that's a testament to the power of
mothership.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, peace out from Megahill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say goodbye everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you next time.
