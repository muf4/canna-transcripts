[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we're going to do a coconut oil
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had planned on using the cannabis
leftovers from my wet washing,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I still plan on doing, but what I'm
going to do today is we're going to run a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of grams of some beautiful Barbara
Dry Sift and a couple of grams of some
[SPEAKER_02]: full-melt Oji Kush bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I basically pulled off the recipe from
one of the websites.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our crock pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our two cups of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our organic coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our hash, a spoon, and one cup to
measure up the coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what it's saying,
what we want to do is put a cup of coconut
[SPEAKER_02]: oil into the crock pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess we'll turn it on low once we
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put this over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lift up the crock pot lid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some of this yummy coconut oil out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went right into where it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that would have been a bit messy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little bit melted, not
completely as solid as I've seen it get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably not going to take too
long to melt in the crock pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because coconut is such a great
fat, 100% almost fat, what it does is it
[SPEAKER_02]: does an incredible efficient job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally like the efficiency of
water extraction for pulling out resin
[SPEAKER_02]: with water and ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the equivalent with the coconut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's my preferred oil to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it to be the healthier of most.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one that doesn't get affected too
negatively when you heat it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just generally, coconut oil is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't love coconut oil?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get that into the crock pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: A tiny little bit of extra in there so it
would be the little bit I lost in the cup
[SPEAKER_02]: piece will be not too detrimental.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get that in the crock pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we turn the crock pot on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an old crock pot I borrowed from a
friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably from the 70s, which is also
kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we turn that on low, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why turn it on high when you can turn it
on low?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're asking to use dried material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm personally using bubble and sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll put that in direct after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the coconut oil has melted,
we're going to put the resin into the
[SPEAKER_02]: coconut oil, mix it up a little bit,
get it somewhat melted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they want us to add many cups of
RO water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, five to six cups of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, you don't have to worry
about the water not all boiling out
[SPEAKER_02]: because what's going to happen is that
water, when we freeze this whole thing at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end, the oil and the water separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually you can just puncture a hole
through the top and drip out the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to show all this whole
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got our coconut oil on low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simmering away here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I guess what I'll do is I'll
come back once the coconut oil is
[SPEAKER_02]: liquefied and we will put in the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll watch that melt and dissipate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will add our water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, it's just a matter of
flicking it onto high, closing the lid and
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much leaving it for about six
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope this is going to teach you guys
something that you didn't know before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll get back to it pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the coconut oil has liquefied.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one little bump left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll wait for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's our barber dry sift and our bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, welcome back guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our coconut oil turned into a
nice liquid on the crock pot on low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took about 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're going to, I thought about
how I was going to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of the recipes call for
cheesecloth.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the recipes are using plant
matter, cannabis, leaf, stock,
[SPEAKER_02]: trim, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using straight hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called my good buddy D420K who's already
done a little bit of this with herb as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said the sift just melted so
beautifully as he dropped it into the
[SPEAKER_02]: crock pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping I can get a similar effect with
the hash that I've got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breaking up the bubble a little bit
smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in kind of turd size.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in kind of turd size pieces right
now, like a mouse turd type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just trying to break it up a little bit
nicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is melty and it should literally,
you know, there's very little to any plant
[SPEAKER_02]: matter whatsoever in this hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just pretty much glandular heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's going to melt quite nicely
in the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the filters are for.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, I've got a 25 micron bubble bag
that I'll be filtering all of this through
[SPEAKER_02]: to capture any wax membranes or small
amounts of plant matter that somehow make
[SPEAKER_02]: it into the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll filter that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for now, I guess the recipe says to add
the plant matter first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add it up in there and then pour the water
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll show you guys this with the camera
if you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put it in here into this
beautiful crock pot with coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll start with the sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we will throw the rest in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my pressing screen here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little piece of bubble stuck there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little bit of sift on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is our product inside the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we could stir that around a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get a spoon and I'll stir that around
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will add the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will steep for about, oh,
I want to say six to eight hours that this
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be going for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go get a spoon,
give this a little bit of a mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll add our water in, RO or distilled
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll let this steep for the next six
to eight hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll see what we've got going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four grams of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really clean hash, like pure as
pure can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the crock pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll turn that on to high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will also add our water.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got our water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our coconut oil melted down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our sift and bubble melting into
the coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've added that couple of cups of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use four to five cups of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on how long you're going to be
steeping for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've put in a couple for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will probably put in a couple of
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it steep for six to eight hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to open this up and we're
going to show you what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the crock pot's just been simmering for
a couple of hours now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't opened it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to open it and give it a little
bit of a stir just for the sedentary
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble hash and sift that's still sitting
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using cannabis, it's good to
definitely stir once every hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but you don't have to to each their
own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying one way is better than the
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first time I've ever done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to lift this up gently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give that coconut oil a stir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That felt right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the material that was in there
just dissolved right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to let this steep for a
couple more hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll come back and stir it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, I believe we're going to
freeze it up in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Takes a few hours as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll poke a hole through the top,
filter out the water, and we'll see what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're left with.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have reached the four hour point and it
was it was going pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually seemingly boiling and I
just started doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I didn't take it too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm now going to filter through a
bubble bag light 25 micron bag into a
[SPEAKER_02]: glass Pyrex dish.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just gently pour this extremely hot
coconut oil into the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just filter that out through that screen
and
[SPEAKER_02]: see how it just comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely hot still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the help of this, I should be
able to squeeze it all right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very glad to have this bag helping me with
this job.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very hot coconut oil and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two are mixed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another way, which I do with when I'm
making bubble is you can fill the bag up
[SPEAKER_02]: with air from the top and slide your hand
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the air to force the material out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not water hash, so it can be a little
bit more rough with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not too worried about the squeezing
aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be careful you don't touch the oil
because at this point it's still very
[SPEAKER_02]: warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to let it congeal and turn
into a hardened material because that
[SPEAKER_02]: would make it really hard to go through
the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so pretty much there on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we got in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's just the bubble that's left
in there with a little bit of oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wash that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, one last good squeeze and we'll call
it a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so throw that back in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw that back into the crock pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This we now let cool and I believe it's
going to be a solid couple of hours that
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll be putting it in the refrigerator
for and the water that's still left over
[SPEAKER_02]: here will separate from the coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The oil will be on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water will be on the bottom and we'll
show that on film what we do with that
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Safely tucked away in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover for any contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The proper light.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go, right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so there's the coconut oil
starting to solidify on top and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the water on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, we're back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit later tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been about eight hours of sitting in
the fridge and the coconut oil has
[SPEAKER_02]: hardened.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see on the top layer there that's
coconut oil and on the bottom is the
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simply put, we're going to put a hole
in the coconut layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut a little bit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll pour this water out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Released a little faster than I expected,
but it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coconut oil released with all the
water almost slid right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to slide the coconut
oil out onto a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've used cannabis material,
you'll have some plant matter stuck in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine is clean as can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup of coconut oil and you can just
lightly dampen the paper towel and this
[SPEAKER_02]: will absorb the water from below.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're left with quite an interesting color
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to give that a shot a little bit
later on and I'll be melting this back
[SPEAKER_02]: down and getting it into my containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get back to you and show you the
final product in the containers with a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice view in the background and hopefully
you've learned something from this coconut
[SPEAKER_02]: oil infused extraction concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the next day and I have cooled the
coconut oil extract infusion in my
[SPEAKER_02]: refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big top piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed you a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took that piece and I broke it down and
I put it into a smaller container and it
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't quite look as nice because it was
all just broken bits and pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did is I actually set it on top
of my amp for my stereo and it just heated
[SPEAKER_02]: it up just perfectly enough to melt it
down and create a nice even flow of
[SPEAKER_02]: coconut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice access right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful color that I got out of it
because I didn't use the green plant
[SPEAKER_02]: matter although a lot of you have asked me
why the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to add the water has a few uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very helpful if you are using plant
matter green material.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water acts as a bit of a filter for
the chlorophyll and keeps some of it from
[SPEAKER_02]: going into your final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what it also does is it cools the
batch down and it allows for a slow steep
[SPEAKER_02]: without boiling over those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the water is definitely key.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to use it if you don't want
to but I'm calling it key and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get a product like what I
got here and you can see my color isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: too too far off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a bit of a golden almost a yellow
color compared to the white that is the
[SPEAKER_02]: coconut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not too bad at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely didn't get the green tinge that
many have gotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really happy I took a tiny little bit
last night and slept like a baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on how strong you make it I
would suggest if this is new to you that
[SPEAKER_02]: you try very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little fingertip you know just a
little the tip of a knife type of thing
[SPEAKER_02]: and sort of build up your tolerance I
guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be getting too high
taking too much at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real point of this I mean if it is for
you to get get really high then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: eat a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the real point for me and for sharing
this with you today is to get on feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: your endocannabinoid system daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeding it a little bit at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not destroying yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not being so you can't do your daily
day-to-day things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The important things that you need to do
your work and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time feeding that
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bringing those levels up and removing any
ECS deficiency that could be going on in
[SPEAKER_02]: your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for watching Bubble Man's World
and I hope you guys try out this coconut
[SPEAKER_02]: oil infused idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give your replies in the video and please
subscribe if you're not subscribed and
[SPEAKER_02]: share if you haven't shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
