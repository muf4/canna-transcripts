[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so here we are guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just bumped into each other at the
airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toronto Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Champs.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bump into each other at the front of the
airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: We walk through the front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this maintainer on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, has John tossed that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But John hasn't come in yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pointed out to John, John!
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a maintainer on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one does not smell very airtight
though, does it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, I think that the guy
touched the outside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, open that up and show us what we
got in there because it's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found this at the airport, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, five big gaggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a gram, a gram and a half a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone ruined the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw the roach in the fresh weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude!
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were like, popping quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw the roach in there to jump on
the plane, went to put it in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw it, they're gonna land.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be like, f**k, I got no weed!
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll be flying to Toronto and
we'll bump into them and we'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found, if you lost a purple maintainer,
we found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, see you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna go board this flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
