[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World and welcome
to another episode of Hash Church 2.0.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're at episode nine,
but I kind of can't remember.
[SPEAKER_11]: I named most of them and then kind of
forgot to name one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I called it the We're Back episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think we're around episode nine.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thanks, everyone, for coming in and
being here this morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of excited.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a throw together episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just kind of hit people up last night at
the last minute and said, hey,
[SPEAKER_11]: we're doing an episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to come in, come on in.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to send out the email.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to send out the Facebook link.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see if we can't get a few with me
right now, although we do have one hundred
[SPEAKER_11]: and sixty eight people who are already in
the room.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess some eager Hash Church aficionados
have been waiting since last night.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have been holding down the chat.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anthro, Slothy Heads, Jules, Bingo
Lombardi, 70s Mama, BB Please,
[SPEAKER_11]: Woody Woody, Deckman, Kali Kam,
Jason Wynowski, a whole group of cool
[SPEAKER_11]: people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Cuban's in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I saw the Skunk Man Hash in
there at one point in time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_11]: What is Hash?
[SPEAKER_11]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hash, of course, is the glandular
[SPEAKER_06]: trichol...
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really define Hash as being oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a lot of people do, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if this link is working because
I've sent it out now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll send it out again.
[SPEAKER_11]: See if we can't make sure that's working.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get my panel in here all alone with 232
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a lot of talking just for one guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: See if that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Farmer Tom, how are you doing,
brother?
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty good, buddy.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing really good, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing really good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of happy to just get together
with you guys and shoot the shit this
[SPEAKER_11]: morning, I got to admit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cuban Grower's in the room as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he popped in, he popped out.
[SPEAKER_11]: He'll be back.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You ready to get deep in it today?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cuban Grower's back in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he's trying to figure out his
cameras and whatnot, as we often do,
[SPEAKER_11]: even myself this morning when I kind of...
You know, I've done it so many times.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like getting it all ready.
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting it up and then you send out the
links and you're like, will it work?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this going to work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you, Cuban.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yo, yo, yo, yo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yo, yo, yo, yo.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got me thinking maybe I should be
putting my headphones on just in case I
[SPEAKER_11]: create a little bit of a reverberation or
backlash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just am heavy into the PC gaming and if
you don't have a headset and a microphone,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll yell at you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, forget about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: How can you even go in there?
[SPEAKER_11]: My son's all over that stuff and it's...
You should go kill him one day on
[SPEAKER_11]: Fortnite.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's playing that game, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made so much money.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to dig out my webcam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I bought this thing back when
Hash Church was kicking weekly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I lived out in the woods and didn't
have enough bandwidth to really take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I whipped it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thanks for coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always a pleasure to see you and hear
about what you've been up to in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw some crazy video the other day where
you were drifting in your car.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess one of your passengers was
recording the video.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, oh snap, Cuban.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do as much as I can to keep my
head out of the crazy cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live out here in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drifting is one way to get out there
and get in the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like when I make hash,
I get in the zone too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding dogs, I feel like that's another
thing that's really been putting a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: love in my heart.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell that you're doing things that
bring you joy.
[SPEAKER_11]: So keep it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's generally when people are kind of
on this internet thing, I see people
[SPEAKER_11]: looking for people who are really loving
their lives.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's inspiration to people where they're
just like, oh man, I just see you loving
[SPEAKER_11]: your life.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got your dogs, you got your car,
you got your family, you got your hash and
[SPEAKER_11]: your herb.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's why people gravitate towards you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can promise you that it's not just
because you've won countless amounts of
[SPEAKER_11]: awards for your hash, but because you have
a passion for living and the things that
[SPEAKER_11]: you do, you do with a spark.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people are always going to be
attracted to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bridget's in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I mean, Eric.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do it for the Terps, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Eric and I spoke with each other this
morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were like, what hat are you wearing?
[SPEAKER_11]: What shirt are you wearing?
[SPEAKER_11]: We absolutely did not speak this morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: About what we were wearing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got to give a shout out to Josh for
gifting this shirt right off of his back.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I saw him in Whistler recently with
the Dragon Crew, I do it for the Terps in
[SPEAKER_11]: this shirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of funny to be wearing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, it's hilarious that you would come
in with that shirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is classic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you too.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good to see you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not surprised that you're kind of like
potentially in some type of a hoop house
[SPEAKER_11]: outdoors somewhere.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got a couple of little hoop houses on
the property.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fucking solid.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I want to say hello to after Wade.
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw Wade.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Wade is way back.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you guys remember the last
time he told us he had some bad back
[SPEAKER_11]: issues.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_11]: That when you're laying all crippled up
and then you're like, unmute yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not crippled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just slow this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But recognizing that because I've hurt my
back, it makes a lot of sense not to sit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to ask your forbearance to
take our meeting this morning in bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the same enthusiasm to offer
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I've got a nice back and the
healing is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not the quickest experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an impatient guy.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, yeah, I'm going to turn my
camera off because I don't know that
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody wants to watch my little bed
scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's a little slice of our
farm out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the compost operation and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I hope you're feeling better anyway,
dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that that was a serious kick to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to thank you for, yeah,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to thank you, Marcus,
for your gift to the Colladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your hash washing device was one of the
most hotly bid upon items at the auction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it went for or who ended
up with it, but I put in a couple of bids
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like Bubble Man dropped off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, there he is again.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Wade, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good, Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was taking this morning's meeting laying
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much appreciated the suggestions that
you had on preparations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark and I had a chance to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got bounced out for a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, it still shows my other account
is in here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not sure what happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a little bit of a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_11]: But welcome, Dr. Shaldone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: How's everyone doing today?
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything is great here in the sunny
state of Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to reduce my quality of my video
here, so maybe I'm a little less choppy.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are saying I'm chopping up.
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounding better.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Skunkman Sam, I think I sent you the
link.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where did you go, my brother?
[SPEAKER_11]: Where did you go?
[SPEAKER_11]: I could send it to his Facebook real quick
just in case he's getting it there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always a little bit of difficulty
when we're trying to get things going here
[SPEAKER_11]: at first in the morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Limited bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we'll go on low, medium.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just excited to have a small group of
you guys in here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is everyone still in here?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're working.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got Tom and Cuban and Eric and Wade
and Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can email the link to Sam if you want me
to.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, maybe send it to him just in case.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he was in the room this morning,
so I'm sure that he's popping by.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that Dragonfly Earth Medicine was
going to try, but they're in the middle of
[SPEAKER_11]: pulling down their crop right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And who else?
[SPEAKER_11]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_11]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I invited a bunch of different
people this morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's Hemp Guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on, Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but your lips aren't moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's because I'm a ventricleist.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you're a ventricleist.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them ventricleists.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure why my camera's so fast wind
and I can't unzoom it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope everyone's doing good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope things are nice in sunny Amsterdam
for you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cloudy now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, here too.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Pacific Northwest went into winter
mode 48 hours ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just like fire, fire, fire,
fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: For those of you that don't know,
my entire province is on fire right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like 600 fires that are affecting like
Washington and affecting like Alberta and
[SPEAKER_11]: Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the smoke is just, you know,
unbelievable how many fires there are
[SPEAKER_11]: right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little bit disconcerting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's a natural sort of way for
this to go on and that things need to
[SPEAKER_11]: burn.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's sort of a natural cycle in all
of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it seems a little off right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know what happens to Cali every year
too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just burn, burn, burn, burn, burn.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure all the way up the West
Coast, but British Columbia is on fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you look at the map, it's
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our fire map, there's just little fires
covering the entire province.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a couple of days ago,
you couldn't, there was really nowhere in
[SPEAKER_11]: the province that you weren't smoked out.
[SPEAKER_11]: It kind of created these Serengeti like
sunsets where the sun was just super
[SPEAKER_11]: orange and the sky was just very,
very, I wouldn't say cloudy, but just
[SPEAKER_11]: super hazy and smoky.
[SPEAKER_11]: And definitely a little bit more affecting
people's, you know, ability to breathe on
[SPEAKER_11]: people with sort of breathing disorders
where a little bit more stressed out about
[SPEAKER_11]: it than the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I hope everyone's doing well out
there from the fires, from Cali on up to
[SPEAKER_11]: British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, you know, it's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to end up with a whole lot of
Chipotle weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if you guys ever really
recognize that herb that has that smoke
[SPEAKER_11]: damage to it that you just kind of can't
seem to wash off.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure potentially you could do short
path molecular distill.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find it's really handy to have weed like
that because you don't even have to smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already been smoked.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's already been smoked.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like from a hash maker's
perspective, although I do appreciate your
[SPEAKER_11]: sick and sarcastic twisted humor,
Sam, I do love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It hurts my soul.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like when I see people bring me beautiful
bottom, I'm like, Oh man, that looks so,
[SPEAKER_11]: and then I cracked it open and I'm just
like, Oh, it's the Chipotle herb.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just all, I mean, this, this has to
be a major problem in California,
[SPEAKER_11]: Eric.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's way, it's, I mean, we're not seeing
everybody coming out with the smoke budget
[SPEAKER_15]: all the way, but I mean, there's smoke
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's inevitable for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_15]: The labs are talking about what people can
do to, you know, try to save the stuff or
[SPEAKER_15]: make it usable.
[SPEAKER_15]: In some regards, but it really just
depends on where you are and how long that
[SPEAKER_15]: smoke sits.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I mean, most of Northern California
for the most part has been really hitting,
[SPEAKER_15]: sitting in a really heavy fog of smoke.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, it's cleared out a little bit
here in the grass valley, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: Sierra mountains, uh, to some degree where
I am, but up in Humboldt and the Emerald
[SPEAKER_15]: triangle.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, Garberville and all these
areas I've been lately yesterday was pea
[SPEAKER_15]: soup.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's, it's, I mean, you just think
of how much cannabis that's affecting.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, uh, and it seems to have gotten
worse in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if we're at some sort of a
pinnacle in the cycle, but it definitely
[SPEAKER_11]: seems the last two to three years,
both California and British Columbia are
[SPEAKER_11]: just endless stories of people being,
you know, escorted out of their
[SPEAKER_11]: neighborhoods, neighborhoods burning to
the ground.
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously it's terrible when it's
trees, but when you get into the house
[SPEAKER_11]: fires and you start burning all these
plastics and wires and all these other
[SPEAKER_11]: things, the smoke contains toxicities that
are at a completely different level than
[SPEAKER_11]: just smelling like smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you get this other thing going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I guess the scientists,
uh, would be able to speak a little bit
[SPEAKER_11]: more on that, but how do you clean that?
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you make that available?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even, even like, uh, besides the
weed, for example, yesterday I met up
[SPEAKER_00]: with, uh, with a patient that she has,
she suffers from Lyme disease and she has
[SPEAKER_00]: a very sensitive, like, uh, like a body
overall, you know, a lot of things affect
[SPEAKER_00]: her, but she told me she had multiple
seizures because of the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: She lives in, uh, Lake, Lake County or I
don't know, Lakeport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her dad was showing me a video of like
this enormous wall of fire must not have
[SPEAKER_00]: been like three miles from their city.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, I mean, just like
indirectly without even a smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, it can affect you if you have a
compromised immune system for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All microns of the ash that get deep into
your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're affected by the,
the fires and you're in close proximity to
[SPEAKER_00]: the smoke, you should wear maybe a mask
too.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire that you're mentioning is the,
uh, the biggest fire in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's pretty insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody needs to grow instead of fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to grow fire extinguisher weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it just needs to rain out here
more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I haven't seen rain since March
and it's hot, super dry out here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, supposedly that big fire
Mendocino, uh, the one that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got started by a truck driver's tire
blowing out and the rim creating a spark
[SPEAKER_00]: and igniting like the, the countryside to
the side of the road or some crazy shit
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like, you know, that wouldn't
start a fire anywhere else, but in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, when it's dry like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to mention, uh, Canada,
man, Washington is all smoky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a good friend of mine that,
uh, he has two kids with SMA hasn't left
[SPEAKER_00]: the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been out of the house in like five
days because the air quality is that bad
[SPEAKER_00]: that it could affect his kids negatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's a terrible impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll give you an idea of how bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to see rain Cuban,
come to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have it for you for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you how bad it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw Jodie Emery flew from Toronto to
Vancouver recently.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she, she was basically like,
usually I'm so stoked to get to Vancouver
[SPEAKER_11]: and breathe in the air quality from
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she said it was just the air quality
was so much worse than basically our
[SPEAKER_11]: biggest city in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that gives you an idea of just these
fires are like deeply affecting people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel bad for people with asthma and
emphysema and all these sort of different
[SPEAKER_11]: lung ailments that bronchitis and whatnot,
cause they just get lit up when this
[SPEAKER_11]: happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just makes it like, you know,
20, 30 times worse.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it was, and you get, yeah,
like Cuban was saying, you get these sinus
[SPEAKER_11]: infections and you get pain behind your
eyes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just, it's no bueno.
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes it hard for summer vacation with
the kids and stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause everybody's kind of got to be
indoors or limited amount of play outside
[SPEAKER_15]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, it's been tough all the way
around with this smoke.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can't imagine what the people are
going through that are in the fires and
[SPEAKER_15]: the people that are fighting the fires,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's been really hot and those
guys wear all kinds of gear.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's been a lot of lives lost in
these last few fires.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, you know, on the Redding one,
and it's just surprising how, like you
[SPEAKER_15]: were saying earlier, it's not just forest
fires, it's neighborhood fires and wiping
[SPEAKER_15]: out little areas and things that are
completely new to all of us and how to
[SPEAKER_15]: deal with it really.
[SPEAKER_15]: And how do we prepare for fire living in
these fire stricken areas, I guess you
[SPEAKER_15]: could say.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's, I've been with a lot of
people lately and it's all like,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, get a trailer, park it out in
front of your house, fill it with all the
[SPEAKER_15]: valuables in case there's a fire.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you hook up to this trailer and bail
out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, so every year we unpack our
house and fill up a trailer and,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, spend the summer with this like
bug out trailer, ready to go or something.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's like, I hear all these different
theories on how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, I would say the one thing that
I've noticed traveling to a lot of farms
[SPEAKER_15]: lately is that a lot of the farms aren't
prepared for fires.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're prepared for permits and they're
legal and don't get me wrong, they're
[SPEAKER_15]: beautiful farms and things.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you really look around,
you can kind of notice that nobody's
[SPEAKER_15]: prepared for an actual fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: Back in the day.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're seeing a lot of fires down in
Southern Oregon too.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't forget our friends down there in
the Applegate and, you know, Williams and
[SPEAKER_13]: the Rogue Valley down there just getting
slammed again this summer.
[SPEAKER_13]: It hasn't ceased.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of my good friends, James House,
was fighting a fire around his house the
[SPEAKER_13]: other day and he was able to save it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, but it's a lot of, it's really scary
for so many people.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've traveled in to Northern Cal and down
in to Humboldt and it was really bad down
[SPEAKER_13]: there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the further I got in to Mendo,
the worse it got.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I was at Seattle Hemp Fest last
weekend and we could hardly breathe on
[SPEAKER_13]: Saturdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to touch up on like fire
preparation in a, let's say a light dep or
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor permitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a situation where you're outside and
like more in the wilderness, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Mendocino and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you really do to kind of deter
the fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a huge fire your way,
you know, hundreds of thousands of acres,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you even do anything?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it travels at such an incredible
speed.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's definitely something that's
going to be hard to prepare without really
[SPEAKER_11]: affecting your life in a major way.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, removing trees all around
your house and creating that sort of
[SPEAKER_11]: buffer zone.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when Eric was talking about slamming
everything into a trailer, it really
[SPEAKER_11]: reminded me of the back in the Prohibition
days.
[SPEAKER_11]: How often we had to do that with our
gardens.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, how many people here through their
whole indoor garden into a trailer while
[SPEAKER_11]: their landlord, you know, visited their
property.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't even count how many times I did
that in my life, both helping friends and
[SPEAKER_11]: doing it for myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we got so confident at it
towards the end, we'd leave the fucking
[SPEAKER_11]: truck parked in the driveway of the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the people would literally walk by the
fucking thing, go into the house,
[SPEAKER_11]: be like, yeah, OK, everything looks good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, they're driving away and the truck
door is getting opened up and be like,
[SPEAKER_11]: all right, let's get this shit back in
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to all the firemen and the
prisoners who have been fighting the fires
[SPEAKER_11]: down in Cali and up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess we haven't really had a
discussion since Loud Pack's greenhouse
[SPEAKER_11]: facility went up in smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a soul wrencher as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really sorry to hear about that for the
Loud Pack family and the DNA genetics and
[SPEAKER_11]: all those guys that had things growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard all sorts of different numbers
from, you know, $10M upwards of $20M to
[SPEAKER_11]: $30M.
[SPEAKER_11]: And whatever it was, I definitely want to
give my shout out to those guys that keep
[SPEAKER_11]: keeping on absolutely devastating news and
sounds like one of those things that could
[SPEAKER_11]: have potentially have been.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, people ask how we can
prevent things like sprinkler systems is a
[SPEAKER_11]: good idea right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Never a bad idea to have a sprinkler
system.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be able to soak everything down with water
and get that fire out before it really
[SPEAKER_11]: starts.
[SPEAKER_11]: But sometimes these things are
uncontrollable and that Loud Pack fire was
[SPEAKER_11]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, prisoners fighting fires.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think down in Cali, they pull prisoners
out to, I don't know, they don't pay them
[SPEAKER_11]: much, but they get out for the day or
whatever and they fight fires.
[SPEAKER_11]: So good on them.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like a better thing to be
doing than sitting and rotting in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they get time off their sentences
as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Marcus, I would think they should.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's some serious life or death
shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're really kind of like, you know,
there's.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I first met these, we were smoking
hash on the banks of the Ganges and all
[SPEAKER_11]: sorts of different languages were being
spoken.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just an incredible experience from
from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_11]: But one of the things I was intrigued by
was the sort of like there was a couple of
[SPEAKER_11]: guys and I couldn't really put my finger
on one what their trip was, but they were
[SPEAKER_11]: the helpers of the Babas.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they would make the chai tea.
[SPEAKER_11]: They would pack and clean chillums.
[SPEAKER_11]: They would make the campsite clean.
[SPEAKER_11]: They would sweep.
[SPEAKER_11]: They would make sure that everything was
was kind of capiche with the with the
[SPEAKER_11]: Babas campsites.
[SPEAKER_11]: They would prepare food.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I sort of asked the Baba Pashupati
that you guys have maybe seen a picture of
[SPEAKER_11]: me with back in the day, back in the late
90s when I was in India.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he said that, you know, these guys
were people that had gotten that had
[SPEAKER_11]: gotten caught stealing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they had an alternative to go into
prison.
[SPEAKER_11]: They could actually become like a helper
for a Baba and follow this.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, these Babas have hard lives.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't live an easy life.
[SPEAKER_11]: They sleep outside.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them own nothing.
[SPEAKER_11]: They walk everywhere they go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, some some take cars, some,
you know, actually fly.
[SPEAKER_11]: But for the most part, a lot of them,
depending on what sect they're from,
[SPEAKER_11]: whether they're from the the Naga Babas or
the Krishna Babas or the Shevite Babas,
[SPEAKER_11]: they live particularly different hard
lives.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess in India, there's this one of
these helpers that go into prison.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought it was a pretty cool thing
where you just what a great way to
[SPEAKER_11]: rehabilitate a criminal mind, because
fuck, I'm pretty sure I might have a
[SPEAKER_11]: criminal mind when it comes to the law,
at least with the cannabis prohibition
[SPEAKER_11]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely taught me to think a certain
way.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess people that have, you know,
are getting in trouble a multitude of
[SPEAKER_11]: times have this opportunity to go and and
almost study under a sadhu and travel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Travel with him and learn about the
spirituality and, you know, learn about
[SPEAKER_11]: karma and all these different things.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just thought it was a very kind of
intriguing way of getting past,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the pattern of committing crimes
against.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark, you don't have a criminal mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have an outlaw mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially with unreasonable laws.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll accept that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll accept that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could have been the most twisted,
crazy joke ever as he opened his mouth.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yet it was a compliment.
[SPEAKER_11]: At least I take that as a compliment.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mark, Mark Sheldon sent me a link
today.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said, hey, maybe we could talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_11]: The article is called Why Patent Lawyers
Are Watching This Colorado Cannabis Case.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess for those of you that don't
know, we've got You Can, good old Tony and
[SPEAKER_11]: Ernie's company currently suing a Colorado
company named Pure Hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess it's for jacking their
cannabis fat extraction.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what it's all about, Mark?
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you gone far into this case?
[SPEAKER_14]: What they claim is that the product that
Pure Hemp sells infringes on their number
[SPEAKER_14]: one claim in that patent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But isn't their number one claim soaking
cannabinoids into plant fat?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think their number one claim is just a
composition of cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_14]: It says a liquid formulation of THCA
greater than 95% plus terpenes.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a pretty broad claim.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to be THCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be any cannabinoid that's 95% and
with terpenes, correct?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think their number one claim,
if I remember correctly, I'm not looking
[SPEAKER_14]: at the patent right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was, although wait a second.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have, I can tell you what the patent
number is because I have it up.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the so-called 911 patent.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's US 9730 911.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's interesting how it ends in 911.
[SPEAKER_14]: 911.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, I think the number one claim in
that patent is, if I remember correctly,
[SPEAKER_14]: is just a, somebody could look it up and
make sure that this is right.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a composition that contains THCA
greater than 95% plus terpenes to make it
[SPEAKER_14]: liquid.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's the number one claim in
that patent.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they claim, I guess, from what I know,
and I haven't seen, I actually,
[SPEAKER_14]: I have seen it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The document, Marcus, maybe you could post
that link because in that link or in one
[SPEAKER_14]: of these links here, here, I'll send you
this link.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a different link, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could post this link, this would be
really useful for people to see because
[SPEAKER_14]: you could actually see the legal document
that was filed in the court and read it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you could see like, I don't want to
say anything because again, Tony's a
[SPEAKER_14]: friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't want to get sued.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he talked about this and he talked
about wanting to have this as a way to
[SPEAKER_14]: sort of make sure that their intellectual
property is protected.
[SPEAKER_14]: And UCAN is a publicly traded company.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if they are going to pursue a patent on
something, you would only assume that if
[SPEAKER_14]: they pursue the patent and they pay the
attorneys and they pay all the patent fees
[SPEAKER_14]: and they actually get an issued patent,
that they're going to enforce it or at
[SPEAKER_14]: least they're going to try to enforce it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what can happen with this particular
patent is if somebody is being told that,
[SPEAKER_14]: well, you're infringing on our case,
well, it's kind of like a way for UCAN to
[SPEAKER_14]: say, well, okay, well, maybe for your
product, you should, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: buy a license to our patent.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a way to basically try to
monetize the patent that Tony and UCAN
[SPEAKER_14]: has.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, or the company could say,
well, fuck, we don't want to license this.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been selling this for years.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll try to invalidate your patent and
then they'll go through Tony's,
[SPEAKER_14]: the patent, you know, and they'll go
through the claims and everything and try
[SPEAKER_14]: to invalidate it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an expensive exercise too.
[SPEAKER_14]: To invalidate a patent costs hundreds of
thousands of dollars because they got to
[SPEAKER_14]: go to court.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a big protracted battles.
[SPEAKER_14]: So something you probably don't want to
do.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd probably rather license it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Ernie and those guys, they're probably
betting on the fact that companies will
[SPEAKER_14]: play the low risk road and license it as
opposed to- That's exactly what happened,
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark, with the people in Colorado that
they were suing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They rolled and they licensed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's, licensing is a low risk
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you think about it, you know,
maybe that's UCAN's value play here is to
[SPEAKER_14]: try to put together as many of these
licensing agreements that they possibly
[SPEAKER_14]: can.
[SPEAKER_14]: So people are basically just, you know,
paying them licensing revenues and,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, how valuable- I mean, as opposed
to like my patent, for example,
[SPEAKER_14]: just as an example, I could talk about it
because I know about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: When we take THCA, which is what the plant
makes, and we hydrogenate it, we make
[SPEAKER_14]: HHCA.
[SPEAKER_14]: And HHCA is a total new composition of
matter that was never described in the
[SPEAKER_14]: chemical literature or never described in
the patent literature.
[SPEAKER_14]: So right away, we rushed the patent that
just because we wanted to make sure that
[SPEAKER_14]: other people didn't.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you could protect a new composition
like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, if you look at Tony's composition,
their composition is a mixture of things.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's really in an examiner's,
a patent examiner's opinion that there's
[SPEAKER_14]: an inventable step there.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's like, again, think always,
I've used this example on Hash Church
[SPEAKER_14]: before.
[SPEAKER_14]: Edison, when he was looking for the
filament, the incandescent light bulb,
[SPEAKER_14]: right?
[SPEAKER_14]: He was trying filament after filament
after filament.
[SPEAKER_14]: Should have given up after 152.
[SPEAKER_14]: He tries the 153rd time.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's tungsten filament.
[SPEAKER_14]: The bulb stays lit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Aha, an invention.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the invention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: The analogy still stands, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know if it's 152 or 252.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_14]: The point is that you can't predict an
invention from what's prior art,
[SPEAKER_14]: what's already known.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if it's already known that THC and
cannabinoids and terpenes can be provided
[SPEAKER_14]: in a formulation to give a certain effect,
you could argue, again, that there's a
[SPEAKER_14]: certain obviousness that they have to be
able to overcome.
[SPEAKER_14]: What was the aha moment of that invention?
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there a certain combination of
terpenes and a certain ratio of
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: It becomes difficult to really say where
the inventive step is.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, again, just to contrast it,
again, I'm trying to throw a sandwich at
[SPEAKER_14]: this.
[SPEAKER_14]: With our compound, we were the first ones
to make it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know what it's good for,
but because we're the first to make it,
[SPEAKER_14]: we have to patent it because it's a new
composition.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tony's patent is around existing
composition.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when you take existing compositions and
do new things to them, you have to do
[SPEAKER_14]: something that's completely new and
unexpected.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that unexpected result, like you try
50 combinations and it doesn't work,
[SPEAKER_14]: but that 51st combination works,
that's an invention, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something that you have to protect
because the prior art, everything that's
[SPEAKER_14]: known to that point tells you that that
51st thing won't work.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you find some synergistic combination
that you wouldn't be able to be predicted
[SPEAKER_14]: from what's already known.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's really important in patent law
is having something that, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, again, everything's kind of known
to a certain level.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like people know that you can make new
cannabinoids and they have certain
[SPEAKER_14]: biological activity.
[SPEAKER_14]: But certainly when you're making new
compositions and new structures that have
[SPEAKER_14]: never been made before, which is what I've
been doing, that's where it really becomes
[SPEAKER_14]: just a complete all out exploration
because you can take existing ingredients
[SPEAKER_14]: and existing terpenes and existing
cannabinoids, combine them in a certain
[SPEAKER_14]: way and maybe find some, you know,
off the scale combination that,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, all the other combinations don't
work, but this one combination for
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever the effect that you're looking
for is, it gives you some unexpected
[SPEAKER_14]: activity.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the thing you want to patent
because you couldn't predict that from
[SPEAKER_14]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_11]: God, I sound like a broken record,
but- But that sounds a lot more complex
[SPEAKER_11]: than just like saying, oh, we put terpenes
and cannabinoids into a plant fat mixture,
[SPEAKER_11]: which people have been doing for a very
long time and patenting that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so like what pure ham, we'll do or any
potential infringer of Tony's patent can
[SPEAKER_14]: do is look at the literature, find those
examples and bring those examples to the
[SPEAKER_14]: examiner to try to invalidate the patent.
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, that's expensive and- I'm familiar.
[SPEAKER_14]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spent several hundred thousand or a
million dollars doing so fighting the
[SPEAKER_05]: back.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know, like people who,
like put their life savings into their
[SPEAKER_14]: idea, trying to bring it to market.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you think about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some, some of these people are hanging on
to dear life, just trying to maintain the
[SPEAKER_14]: exclusivity that their patent provides to
them, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, a thing and how I really chose to
deal with that is that when you have
[SPEAKER_11]: someone like you can with a patent like
this, they're going to start attacking
[SPEAKER_11]: infringers.
[SPEAKER_11]: What the infringers need to do is they
need to gather together and create like,
[SPEAKER_11]: so they're all sharing one lawyer and they
make one case.
[SPEAKER_11]: And once they attack five or six or seven
or eight people and those five or six or
[SPEAKER_11]: seven together and fight back
independently, well, now they're only
[SPEAKER_11]: paying one eighth of the court fee
normally otherwise pay and you get a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: more strength.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not trying to tell everyone how
they should fight.
[SPEAKER_11]: I ended up the patent and I worked it out
with Ryan really well and I'm glad that
[SPEAKER_11]: it, but at the same time, if you don't
feel the patent is valid and you really,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, want to fight it and have that
previously published knowledge,
[SPEAKER_11]: doing it as a group of with other people
who are being infringed is definitely the
[SPEAKER_11]: way to go about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because as you, as you point out,
the legal costs are tremendous,
[SPEAKER_14]: but also just the negative burden or the
burden of all this negativity,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, when you go after people in a
court and you're filing motions against
[SPEAKER_14]: each other, you send tend to get,
you know, a little bit, things tend to get
[SPEAKER_14]: a little bit nasty, but you got to also
remember that like if, if you can license
[SPEAKER_14]: that patent to a company, so let's say a
company gets together with Tony and they
[SPEAKER_14]: actually get a license for it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that company that's paying that
licensing fee, they need you can to crack
[SPEAKER_14]: down on infringers, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they're paying the licensing fee.
[SPEAKER_14]: They expect to have some exclusivity
around that technology.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the way patents work is that
you, you're, you're patenting and
[SPEAKER_14]: licensing basically something that gives
a, another part of the party, the freedom
[SPEAKER_14]: to operate and the freedom to basically
make that knowing that again, the people
[SPEAKER_14]: who hold the intellectual property are
getting some kind of licensing revenue
[SPEAKER_14]: from that, you know, typically in the,
in the chemical industry or in the food
[SPEAKER_14]: industry, not pharmaceuticals,
anything but pharmaceuticals, those
[SPEAKER_14]: licensing revenues are anywhere between
two to five to seven at sometimes percent
[SPEAKER_14]: in perpetuity.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when you license a technology to a
commercial organization that then takes
[SPEAKER_14]: that and commercializes it, the owner of
that IP should expect to see somewhere
[SPEAKER_14]: between about five, six, seven percent of
that revenue, that gross revenue,
[SPEAKER_14]: come back to you in a licensing agreement.
[SPEAKER_14]: Typically you have a, there's milestone
payments when you go to license a
[SPEAKER_14]: technology and you enter into a memorandum
of understanding and our LOI typically are
[SPEAKER_14]: usually the way those things get started,
but ultimately the licensing fees that are
[SPEAKER_14]: paid and yeah, those companies that
basically now buy those licenses need the
[SPEAKER_14]: enforcement of that intellectual property
over these so-called infringers.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it can breed a lot of negativity in the
industry because if you think about it,
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a lot of people selling,
you know, terpene concentrates,
[SPEAKER_14]: right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's hard to think, you know,
who's not infringing on, on this patent,
[SPEAKER_14]: right?
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, let's be frank.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not throwing sand on the patent.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not saying anything that's legally
binding here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just giving you my opinion as an expert in
the field of patenting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how much is the licensee for the
hydrogenated THCA?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm jacking it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm jacking it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see Mark sue me.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we're going to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we're doing the right thing with
HHCA.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to be doing preclinical
testing starting this month actually in,
[SPEAKER_14]: in unfortunately in animals, but also in
human cellular testing models where we're
[SPEAKER_14]: going to look at the anti-cancer property
of hydrogenated cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we do believe a quick and easy route
to market is a topically applied cream or
[SPEAKER_14]: salve for the treatment of skin cancer,
because you have a direct delivery of the
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabinoids right into the cancerous
tumor.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to go through a pill and
the gut and the liver and everything that
[SPEAKER_14]: comes with taking a pill or some type of
oral medication.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go after, you know,
sort of like the Rick Simpson notion of,
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, apply cannabis oil, the skin tumors,
and they go away.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're going to put a value
proposition to that and basically take
[SPEAKER_14]: hydrogenated cannabinoids into those
formulations because we think they'll have
[SPEAKER_14]: a good activity doing that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, it's just an easy way to
basically take something that's obviously
[SPEAKER_14]: a tumor and, you know, treat it directly
with infusion of cannabinoids right into
[SPEAKER_14]: the tumor itself, which is just a godsend
for drug delivery.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're trying to take a pill and get a
systemic delivery of cannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_14]: somewhere that has cancer in your body,
that's a real tough boulder to push up a
[SPEAKER_14]: hill.
[SPEAKER_14]: But direct treatment of tumors with
cannabinoids could essentially be a good
[SPEAKER_14]: payoff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, cannabis survived prohibition.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hope it can survive corporate
douchebaggery.
[SPEAKER_14]: It will, because the plant is ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's, it's, it's here.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a, it's already been here.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I mean, it's so funny because
yeah, I mean, you see this happening here
[SPEAKER_14]: in the States and I'm sure it's happening
with legalization in Canada is yeah,
[SPEAKER_14]: big money is getting in and where big
money gets in, that's where Paterson,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, exclusive licensing and branding
and all that stuff, you know, plays a
[SPEAKER_14]: really big role.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big money has come in.
[SPEAKER_11]: We used to think it was big money when
Tilray and, and privateer and Tweed Canopy
[SPEAKER_11]: were raising a $4 billion U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: raised for cannabis and a 4 billion U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: that's $5 billion raised in the cannabis
industry from Coronation, the company that
[SPEAKER_11]: owns Corona beer.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's, that's the largest raise I've ever
heard of in my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: Has anyone else heard of anything larger
than that?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the one, huh?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: A license, a distressed license in,
in Florida, a medical license.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're about to go recreational,
but they're about to issue a bunch more
[SPEAKER_14]: medical license, but a distressed license
in Florida recently closed at $59 million.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, so this is probably a license
that probably cost, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe one or $2 million to put together.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're selling it for $59 million.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's pretty, pretty substantial.
[SPEAKER_14]: It turned out that when they, then they
put the law in Florida in place,
[SPEAKER_14]: you had to be grandfathered in as somebody
who has been in the agricultural industry,
[SPEAKER_14]: either, you know, growing perennials or
shrubs or vegetables or whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we all know that, you know,
just because you can grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: Arborvitae and, you know, roses,
that doesn't mean you can grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so this was one of those examples of a
business that basically got into the
[SPEAKER_14]: industry that never should have been in to
begin with, fail.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then some multinational comes in and
basically scoops them up at an incredible,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, upside.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'm just trying to close some,
some programs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like people are saying that they're not
hearing me very well, that I'm breaking up
[SPEAKER_14]: like a robot, which is- Sounds great,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds very clear and fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's breaking up on my end too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_11]: It means I don't, I can't really share.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it doesn't help when we cut each
other off too.
[SPEAKER_05]: John Page also recently sold an idea for
$122 Canadian dollars.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is a third of what Haiku just said,
sold their brand that has two coffee shops
[SPEAKER_11]: to canopy for $350 million.
[SPEAKER_11]: For a brand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty insane.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm probably going to stop talking.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you guys want to keep the
conversation going, if I'm a robot,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's no point for me to talk really.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're only breaking up sometimes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm reading the chat.
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it'll record better anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: So sometimes that happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: The bandwidth just squishes out,
but once it's recorded, people will be
[SPEAKER_11]: able to kind of go back and listen and
watch.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds fine now.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was earlier and it's probably
just your wifi, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think it's important that we all
keep our mics muted as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: How much is Bubble Man brand worth?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm having a hard time in this whole thing
with this just giant corporate structure
[SPEAKER_11]: that's occurring with the different,
it's just a changing game in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see it and I'm not necessarily overly
against it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I kind of see how cannabis is
just, it's doing what we wanted it to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're plugging it into every other aspect
of agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, you know, like these things are
occurring in every other aspect of life.
[SPEAKER_11]: I see people complain about cannabis
constantly, but I know they're still
[SPEAKER_11]: supporting every other industry and every
other aspect of their life from where they
[SPEAKER_11]: buy their vehicles, their computers,
their clothes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Their food, you know, the beer they drink,
like literally everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they, you know, they're all like,
but we got to buy a Kraft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, well, but you don't really do
that in regards to everything else.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you're like, it'll, it's just an
interesting switch to see how many people
[SPEAKER_11]: truly will support Kraft cannabis and how
many people will end up, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: purchasing Coors Light.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Coors Light does more sales than
the IPA.
[SPEAKER_15]: All the testing now too, because a lot of
people are really concerned about how
[SPEAKER_15]: clean cannabis can be, but yet our food
has a lot of allowable limits.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not trying to advocate dirty
cannabis by any means, but you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: I did a panel with some people that were
from testing labs or testing lab,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, companies.
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the things they said was what
is the metric for zero?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like what is clean?
[SPEAKER_15]: If everybody's like, you know,
if every bit of wine is contaminated with
[SPEAKER_15]: glyphosate and kids are peeing round up
the same.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's, you know, basically they're
saying everything is contaminated.
[SPEAKER_15]: Contaminated to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so how do we start with zero for
cannabis and go from there?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if everything else is
contaminated, they have a tough time
[SPEAKER_15]: creating that zero metric is I guess is
what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially in the Salinas Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys all saw this, but sea salt turns out
has micro plastic in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No more sea salt folks.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, a lot of people aren't passing
tests right now since they kicked up the
[SPEAKER_15]: new testing on July 1st for California.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's been a little bit tough
getting everything organized.
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to Oakland right after July 1st and
everybody in Oakland was freaking out
[SPEAKER_15]: because there was no flowers on the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Harbor side from what I heard and
various dispensaries in Oakland didn't
[SPEAKER_15]: have any flowers because after July 1st,
the packaging and the testing kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: wiped everything out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's definitely going to be an
interesting time here for all the labs and
[SPEAKER_15]: what we're dealing with now for getting
all this product out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even touching upon that,
I was down in LA three weeks ago to see
[SPEAKER_00]: some potential lab space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was at a friend's shop at a HHS in
Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whatever that area is called
particularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, that shop used to have every
single good produced product in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical side of things years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had seen some good melt from
whatever your favorite producer was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could find it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was there and I wanted to see what
adult use looked like because I had never
[SPEAKER_00]: stepped into a... I hope you guys can hear
me well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never stepped into a recreational
store in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I was in there in the back room,
I was like, you know, let me check out
[SPEAKER_00]: your shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shelves were so empty,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there is one hash brand,
710 Labs, no one else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like Carter's Aromatherapy
Design and he's not on the adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 90% of everything that was on
the shelf was brands that I had never
[SPEAKER_00]: heard of before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice marketing and presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously they got their shit together
that they can get their product on a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I only recognize 10% of people from
the medical days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked Jason about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, what percentage of
the old cannabis industry do you expect to
[SPEAKER_00]: be fully regulated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say like two years from now when
everything stabilizes, who do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: will be the players?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, it's only going to be about
10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% is going to be everyone else that had
a good game plan that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: had a goal and they worked together to
achieve that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone else was taking advantage of
how easy it was to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the open market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that rattled me, man, because it's so
hard to be in the adult use California
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like crazy, crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, to do it straight legal and do it
on your own and not have investors or any
[SPEAKER_15]: of these kinds of things, or not try to
create little side doors, I guess.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, like it's really tough.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just went to Garberville Thursday
night and they had what was called a
[SPEAKER_15]: community outcry meeting in Southern
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, it was three hours of people
getting up at the mic, pretty much,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, explaining how difficult
everything is, not even on the state
[SPEAKER_15]: level.
[SPEAKER_15]: But just on the county level application
process, because there was people that,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, the county is saying,
and the permitting people are saying how
[SPEAKER_15]: easy it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll help you.
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll walk you through it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, you know, a process.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there's people that got up and
said, look, I got a, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: master's degree.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a lawyer, this, that, and the other.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we couldn't get through your
application process.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then people end up paying a consultant
of some kind to spend a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_15]: it sounds like to me to get through the
application process.
[SPEAKER_15]: Only to get denied because something got
screwed up or whatever, didn't get filled
[SPEAKER_15]: out properly.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I mean, 40% less cannabis is planted in
Garber, in Humboldt County alone,
[SPEAKER_15]: not the Emerald Triangle, just Humboldt
County, 40% less cannabis has been planted
[SPEAKER_15]: this year on the, on the permitted side of
things.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they just had a bust actually of an
unpermitted garden.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was up there on Wednesday,
it was 20,200 111 plants, 65 pounds of
[SPEAKER_15]: pre-rolls, like 90 pounds of vape
cartridges.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it was insane.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's plenty of them like that up
there really kind of divided everything in
[SPEAKER_15]: a weird way, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we've seen up here in Washington
is the same thing you're going to see in
[SPEAKER_13]: California.
[SPEAKER_13]: We lost like 90% of the medical growers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now that we're now the legalization
happens, 70% of the people who signed up
[SPEAKER_13]: are no longer in business.
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus it's happening now in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're going to see, see the same
thing in California.
[SPEAKER_13]: These communities have just been
devastated.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like the whole Southern Oregon region has
totally been devastated.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's only like 90, 90% of the
medical growers don't grow down there
[SPEAKER_13]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: The prices are hitting rock bottom for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: And from what I hear in California,
when you're taking money now, they're
[SPEAKER_13]: averaging at $100 a pound.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you're borrowing money or you're
going into some deal with somebody,
[SPEAKER_13]: the rate is going to be $100 a pound.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how can anybody turn a light on for
$100 a pound is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the guys like in the chat,
they're talking about support black market
[SPEAKER_00]: and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me tell you when that model also
would fail theoretically because it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: reality check that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs me, I grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my personal view on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs me about $400 to $450 to produce
a good unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get three pounds per light,
it might go down a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have to pay for permits,
rent, employees, everything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to calculate that into that price
per pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm making these concentrates off this
very expensive pound, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if someone comes around and
they're also regulated and they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, look, let's make a contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow the same quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give me your strains, I'll grow you an
acre and I'll charge you $200 a pound or
[SPEAKER_00]: $150 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point you can make a similar
quality concentrate, bring your price down
[SPEAKER_00]: to where it's on the shelf for $40 maybe
per gram or something less like that
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of having to put it on there for a
hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point growing weed is not
even, it doesn't even make sense indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore unless you're growing for flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's always going to be companies
that grow crap cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To have a loyal following.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I'm talking about like scaling,
like seeing a product available for 21 and
[SPEAKER_00]: over all across the state or let's say all
across the country to where you won't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go black market because maybe the same
quality is there, tested, clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when black market probably doesn't
work anymore, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where this thing is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sad, but it's true though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've been faced with is that if I
try to focus on black market, I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get swallowed up by the legal
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've had a lot of difficulty getting
into the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what I want to do is consult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that I can help companies
produce the product and not have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through like the loops of getting my own
or the hoops of getting my own permit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Amen, amen.
[SPEAKER_14]: Consulting is a good way because what
you're doing is you're lending your
[SPEAKER_14]: expertise to a client who basically is
bearing the financial risk.
[SPEAKER_14]: And at this point, again, your expertise
is none other.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Cuban, if I could say so myself,
I mean, you bring a unique product to
[SPEAKER_14]: market that people will definitely want to
pay consulting fees for.
[SPEAKER_14]: To distinguish their product.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I want to go back to something you had
just said.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the moments not lost on this is that
one thing you have to consider when you go
[SPEAKER_14]: from say like a 10 lighter to a 10 acre is
the scaling of your workforce.
[SPEAKER_14]: And ultimately, you're talking about no
longer just growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're talking about managing a workforce,
which is a whole burden unto itself
[SPEAKER_14]: because again, there's a lot of different
crazy characters out here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And going through the resumes and going
through the background checks and getting
[SPEAKER_14]: people who are compliant in a legal market
is one bucket of people.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of people because they have
things on the record who are not
[SPEAKER_14]: compliant.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that often creates, again,
a separation in those who can work in a
[SPEAKER_14]: legal regulated industry and those you
can't.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that cost.
[SPEAKER_14]: So at the end of the day, and come
monetization, you see this and regardless
[SPEAKER_14]: of whether it's cannabis or any commodity
is the guy who can produce at the lowest
[SPEAKER_14]: cost and still produce a high quality
product.
[SPEAKER_14]: And how does he do that?
[SPEAKER_14]: He gets you to consult.
[SPEAKER_14]: He gets you to consult at his large grow
where now he can use your expertise to
[SPEAKER_14]: make a high quality product at that
volume, employing that workforce,
[SPEAKER_14]: ensuring those people running the
background checks for those people and
[SPEAKER_14]: really creating a whole economy unto
itself.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you dig what I'm trying to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like being an IP holding almost and being
able to, I don't know, I see it in two
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help produce the product for them
in the sense that they put up the money,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw up the lab, go through all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go in there and private label it
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could do also consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their crew instead of having to
assemble crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their own crew and kind of
optimize the square footage of that lab
[SPEAKER_00]: space as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually make good money and have
a product that's marketable for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these guys that are growing
acres, I think it's a lot harder for
[SPEAKER_00]: someone that's, let's say the prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor guys have it better because they
scaled pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: But indoor, the scaling was small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're trying to get somebody and
say, yeah, I grow good weed and you try to
[SPEAKER_00]: make them scale a lot of times,
it's not the same as somebody that may
[SPEAKER_00]: have a degree in agriculture or whatever,
a dude that has a team with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come with a plan ready to grow
multiple acres successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hit the books.
[SPEAKER_00]: They theoretically believe in what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that transition going
from craft to that big scale takes a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of knowledge, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of help, a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a long runway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_11]: You need serious investments to create a
long enough runway to get a company like
[SPEAKER_11]: that to take off properly because so many
companies just don't understand the actual
[SPEAKER_11]: investment that needs to be made to create
some of these labs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Large walk-in freezer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I'm waiting for Mike to come in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike West, but I have a little project
that I'm working on here in Canada on the
[SPEAKER_11]: West Coast that I wanted to share with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll wait for Mike to come in before
we talk about it because he drove up from
[SPEAKER_11]: Spokane two days ago to come do a
walkthrough of the facility to check it
[SPEAKER_11]: out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Much what you were speaking in regards to
consulting, I'm all about pulling the best
[SPEAKER_11]: people that I know from my community to
put these projects together.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know for myself that my expertise is
very limited with mechanical screen
[SPEAKER_11]: separations, water extraction.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll have all different types of
extraction.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to keep that in and we'll
be smoking that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've seen everyone puff and tough.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we should have a little,
like maybe if D420K was in the room,
[SPEAKER_11]: he'd say, bong rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'd all hit a little rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys down?
[SPEAKER_11]: Tom's down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, all I can say for everybody is we
got to diversify.
[SPEAKER_13]: All of us that have been in this industry
for so long and kind of created it and we
[SPEAKER_13]: gave them the platform from which to grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's time for us to really diversify and
be as flexible as possible.
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're going to survive this whole
transition, we're going to transition into
[SPEAKER_13]: this corporate mess that we're headed
into.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a downhill slide.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a race to the bottom like we've seen
here in Washington and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_13]: The same thing is going to happen in
California.
[SPEAKER_13]: All these poor farmers up there in the
Golden Triangle are going to, I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: the Emerald Triangle are really going to
suffer big time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, it's going to be horrible.
[SPEAKER_13]: How many of these mega facilities are
there in California?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm counting like eight to 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so it's really going to be,
the price is just going to hit the bottom
[SPEAKER_13]: and we all just got to diversify and come
up with different kind of game plans and
[SPEAKER_13]: which so we can stay in the game and so we
can take care of our families and our
[SPEAKER_13]: communities.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the beautiful thing about cannabis
is it's the most adaptable plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we can't adapt with it, then there's
something wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the same time, you know,
I want people to be able to make their
[SPEAKER_11]: living off of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: But on the flip side of things like three
and four and $5,000 pounds was obscene.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was based not on the magicalness of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was based on people doing 10 years in
prison in Alabama and Oklahoma and Texas
[SPEAKER_11]: and all these fucking states.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where those prices came from.
[SPEAKER_11]: So those were like those were the way they
came to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: The prices just weren't an accurate
description of reality.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were a description of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to get rid of prohibition,
got rid of those prices.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's you know, Sam's been saying it for
years.
[SPEAKER_11]: We could grow this stuff way cheaper and
make it very affordable.
[SPEAKER_11]: For pennies on the dollar kind of thing
compared to these.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, my God, $5,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly have been saying for decades
that the industry will end up in the hands
[SPEAKER_05]: of people like the organic vegetable
growers or the organic flower growers like
[SPEAKER_05]: for the cut flower industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in Holland, they barely have a cut
flower industry anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in many countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the last decade, they've moved them all
to tropical countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Malaysia, Kenya, countries like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where all the cut flowers are
produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of them are not organic, but it can
be done organically too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are professional agronomists.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guarantee you they can grow cheaper
than you can.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but does the repeal of alcohol
prohibition offer any insight to what may
[SPEAKER_14]: happen in the repeal of cannabis
prohibition?
[SPEAKER_14]: So if like the repeal of alcohol
prohibition, and again, not all counties
[SPEAKER_14]: in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_14]: serve alcohol, there are still dry
counties that abide by prohibition of
[SPEAKER_14]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_14]: But as alcohol prohibition was repealed,
and if you think about it, in the 50s and
[SPEAKER_14]: 60s, we were drinking beers, beers from
multinational beer corporations.
[SPEAKER_14]: And ultimately there became a craft beer
industry, micro brews.
[SPEAKER_14]: And people are really into flavored
scotches now and authentic, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: really, you know, artisan level,
you know, alcohol.
[SPEAKER_14]: Could the same kind of thing be like a
reflection of what's going to happen with
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis, which is that, yeah,
there will be some mass produced bullshit
[SPEAKER_14]: that you can buy in Walmart, but hopefully
still at, you know, somewhere close by to
[SPEAKER_14]: where you live, you'll be able to buy a
craft cannabis product, be it a
[SPEAKER_14]: concentrate or flower, and it's made just
the way that, you know, it was when it was
[SPEAKER_14]: grown in the black market days,
and it's still good, and it's still,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, really dank, and it's not
suffered in quality, and it's basically
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe paying a little bit more than you're
going to pay in 7-Eleven for pre-rolls,
[SPEAKER_14]: but you're paying the farmer who needs to
you know, coup his investment and,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, have a livelihood to be able to
produce that product for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's likely, Mark.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the only problem is that it's
niche, and it's going to be a lot fewer
[SPEAKER_11]: people than the people that are,
you know, if it's musical chairs,
[SPEAKER_11]: a lot of people are going to be left
standing without a chair, because it's
[SPEAKER_11]: just not the same way as it was.
[SPEAKER_11]: And although 7-Eleven is a good analogy,
I think the real, the real low quality is
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be served up at the gas stations.
[SPEAKER_11]: You get into the gas stations,
go get some pre-rolled herb, that's going
[SPEAKER_11]: to be.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, but, and the president of Maryland
tells you that the best fried chicken is
[SPEAKER_14]: at the Royal Farms, which is a gas
station.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, gas stations are now these
mega complexes that serve food,
[SPEAKER_14]: caffeine, gasoline, sugar, fats,
and everything that we need as humans to
[SPEAKER_14]: basically keep our cars and ourselves
going.
[SPEAKER_14]: They also have bathrooms if you need to do
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, I mean, those mega gasoline
station complexes would seem to be
[SPEAKER_14]: invading our country.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if they're like that up in
Canada, but certainly these places like
[SPEAKER_14]: Wawa or Royal Farms.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, you can get really good fried
chicken at Royal Farms.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're pretty chill now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just got the one road that goes from
the west to the east.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's the odds, and not many
though.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more of a rarity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody have an idea how much,
what's the cheapest price you can produce
[SPEAKER_05]: the highest quality cannabis for?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know by the kilogram, because I've done
it for decades on multi-acre facilities.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so share that information with us,
because there's definitely, you're the one
[SPEAKER_05]: who knows the answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: About a hundred euros a kilo un-manicured.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hand-manicuring was the most expensive
product.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Considering that, that herb he's talking
about is, it's shockingly strong and like
[SPEAKER_11]: shockingly good.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I will say about that to this
day.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been trying to look at a lot of those
numbers or go back and forth with people
[SPEAKER_15]: about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm finding the indoors up to 545 a
pound on the hydro, you know, general
[SPEAKER_15]: hydroponics type of method.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then when we get into the no-till
organic or even, you know, outdoor
[SPEAKER_15]: growers, for that matter, it varies so
much because one of the things that's
[SPEAKER_15]: happening is that everybody's dealing with
disease and they got to pass these tests
[SPEAKER_15]: and the root aphids are taking everybody
by storm.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just insane the level of battle
that people are paying for in order to try
[SPEAKER_15]: to make their plants, A, make it to the
end and B, pass the test.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's not even the cost of
production.
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like in some ways, even though
that's what we would call it, it's the
[SPEAKER_15]: cost of like loss.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, and so there's a lot of
break even out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of people that are not
knowing what to do anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the funny thing is, is, or,
you know, the sad part about it was a lot
[SPEAKER_15]: of people are actually, we're trying new
things and now they're going back to the
[SPEAKER_15]: old ways and the old ways don't work like
they used to either.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so there's a lot of like throwing the
hands in the air because we started going
[SPEAKER_15]: with the new methods and that wasn't
really serving them right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they jumped back to the old methods.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then those blow apart too.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, it's been really tough out
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've been going around to,
since I left forever flowering to a lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: farms doing some assessments and some
management type things and a lot of rescue
[SPEAKER_15]: is what I call it greenhouse and farm
rescue to a degree, because like I said,
[SPEAKER_15]: so many people are throwing their hands up
and not everybody also is at their farms.
[SPEAKER_15]: The owners of these farms are actually,
or own several farms and they can't be in
[SPEAKER_15]: one place every day.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time, or, you know, they don't have
the SOP set up either for their crew
[SPEAKER_15]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, we find a lot of people doing
so many different things, like 10
[SPEAKER_15]: different things on, you know,
one road for 10 different farmers and
[SPEAKER_15]: nobody has any type of, you know,
here's what I'm doing, but then that
[SPEAKER_15]: person does a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's kind of confusing out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you say that again?
[SPEAKER_15]: Diseases or pest?
[SPEAKER_15]: It comes with both.
[SPEAKER_15]: The places people are buying their clones
right now are having several viruses as
[SPEAKER_15]: well as pests.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you get clones from a nursery that's
a permitted nursery and you just get
[SPEAKER_15]: spider mites, you're pretty lucky or
you're stoked.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I mean, there's several nurseries
right now that are licensed that are going
[SPEAKER_15]: through several lawsuits right now because
they all made claims to a degree on their
[SPEAKER_15]: selling points.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they sell a lot of people disease
and viruses and things like this.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then when people get these problems,
they actually do things to eradicate it,
[SPEAKER_15]: to combat or make the problems even worse.
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's, this is an interesting
conversation because we're talking about
[SPEAKER_11]: this, the growing of cannabis blowing up
so big that it's turning into this
[SPEAKER_11]: corporate thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how are we going to keep from getting
cut off now on the flip side of that?
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have cannabis, the only clonally
produced plant that's in the numbers that
[SPEAKER_11]: it is, that is not using tissue culture to
grow the plantlets.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now tissue culture is going to remove the
pathogens, the fungi, the microbials,
[SPEAKER_11]: the intercellular bacterias.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to renew vigor.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to produce equal perfect plants
that you can do acclimation from the
[SPEAKER_11]: plantlets into a small clone in a room
that's designed specifically for the type
[SPEAKER_11]: of grow that you're putting those plants
into, whether it's field grown greenhouse
[SPEAKER_11]: or indoor.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this isn't available in cannabis
because that's really only available when
[SPEAKER_11]: you get to a certain level of commercial
production.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where all the other plants,
all of them figured out that we need
[SPEAKER_11]: tissue culture to continue this on the
level that we're continuing if we're going
[SPEAKER_11]: to grow without being destroyed because
these pests, these bacterias, these fungi,
[SPEAKER_11]: these diseases and viruses can actually
decimate your crop to the level of like
[SPEAKER_11]: millions upon millions upon millions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the nurseries are responsible because
I don't care how good of a grower you are,
[SPEAKER_11]: if you're buying plants that are
impregnated with pathogens, fungi and
[SPEAKER_11]: microbials, you are already working like
one arm tied behind your back and one leg
[SPEAKER_11]: tied behind your back.
[SPEAKER_11]: How the fuck are you supposed to produce
great cannabis when you've been given a
[SPEAKER_11]: terrible starting product?
[SPEAKER_11]: And so cannabis tissue culture really at
this point, sure there's companies that
[SPEAKER_11]: can clean the plant up and that's called
initiation.
[SPEAKER_11]: It takes about six months where you're
removing all the bacteria, fungi,
[SPEAKER_11]: pathogens, intercellular bacterias,
all of that is getting taken out of the
[SPEAKER_11]: plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now you have this perfect plant that's
now healthy and ready to go and ready to
[SPEAKER_11]: micropropagate.
[SPEAKER_11]: As well as from set a tissue culture
company that I've spoken about a few
[SPEAKER_11]: times.
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys have it down.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have an incredible tissue culture
scientist and they're starting to make it
[SPEAKER_11]: available for the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to make available these
clean cultivars and not only that,
[SPEAKER_11]: but also working out deals with breeders
where they can kind of get royalties on
[SPEAKER_11]: their plants, which once again,
this is going to get people in an uproar,
[SPEAKER_11]: but this is how it works in bananas and
almonds and blueberries and raspberries
[SPEAKER_11]: and basically every other plant that's
micropropagated.
[SPEAKER_11]: Strawberries, of course, it's every one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it gets to a point where if you want
to grow on, I mean, Driscoll's alone to
[SPEAKER_11]: mention strawberries, which Ian often
does.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where I heard this.
[SPEAKER_11]: They do 10 billion plantlets worldwide a
year, almost 2 billion plantlets.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they take them and they load them up
with carbohydrates and they put them in
[SPEAKER_11]: these aseptic styrofoam boxes that fit
10,000 of these plantless plantlets with
[SPEAKER_11]: bare roots.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can take them and acclimate them
yourself into clones.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have about 72 hours where you can
send this thing in the pitch black.
[SPEAKER_11]: And because they're preloaded with
carbohydrates and they've never
[SPEAKER_11]: photosynthesized, they don't actually go
into flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't convince the plant or trick the
plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we know from Sam talking about it,
one of his awesome tips that he gave was
[SPEAKER_11]: in regards to pre-flowering plants to
check them for sex.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he would just do it for like,
what was it, a day or some hours,
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends if it's an indica or a sativa
or wide leaf or narrow leaf, as I say.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: With longer flowering narrow leaf
varieties, might have to do it for two,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe even three days for really late
maturing, late batch induction ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas with really early ones,
one day, all's a took.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So both of those fail when it comes to
sending things in the pitch black in the
[SPEAKER_11]: mail.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're sending clones, you're going to
confuse them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And start off a process that you really
don't want to start off on a plantlet that
[SPEAKER_11]: small.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's just one more reason tissue
culture is going to be a huge save for the
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's going to help drive the
prices down while still allowing people
[SPEAKER_11]: who want to produce large scale grows to
actually get the job done, because
[SPEAKER_11]: diseases and pests will, I mean,
any farmer knows.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as I know, Sagrath,
they are exploring this, but they have not
[SPEAKER_05]: developed a protocol to identify all of
the cannabis viruses and to eliminate them
[SPEAKER_05]: yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're in the process.
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent point.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when it comes to tissue culture,
one of the most important things is that
[SPEAKER_11]: tissue culture companies need to also have
microbiology labs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those labs have to be cutting edge and on
point is on point is on point.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the most important thing, which is one
of the things Sagrath actually did,
[SPEAKER_11]: is they validated their microbiology lab
before they did it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they took a plant like hops,
which has had tens of millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_11]: spent on it to genetically fingerprint it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they validated their procedures
in that lab with hops rather than trying
[SPEAKER_11]: to do it with cannabis, which really has
no genetic fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_11]: That job hasn't really been done to the
degree of hops.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can promise you that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so validation of the microbiology lab
is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also the SOP that you run in that
microbiology lab.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sagrath has an exceptional
microbiologist, Dr. John Brunstein,
[SPEAKER_11]: who I think ran like the Canadian hospital
microbiology labs here for a decade or
[SPEAKER_11]: more.
[SPEAKER_11]: The guy definitely knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's kind of the flip side of that
coin where we get to a point where we're
[SPEAKER_11]: growing and growing and growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everyone wants a big grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't for a while, but I started with
a light and it grew to five to 10 to 20.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It grows as big as you can make it happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the first time I was ever in a
large garden where people were like,
[SPEAKER_11]: oh, fuck those corporate gardens or
whatever, I came out of it going,
[SPEAKER_11]: no way, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I think we should probably get the
people who are feeling ousted that they
[SPEAKER_11]: don't, that they're not able to grow their
powdery mildew bud in a garage anymore or
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever, and get them into like a larger,
you know, some of these larger facilities
[SPEAKER_11]: that aren't necessarily huge canopies.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the rooms are a thousand square
foot or 1200 to 1500 square foot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've met some exceptional people from
the black market at these large scale
[SPEAKER_11]: licensed production facilities.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're kind of living their dream.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're able to grow cannabis every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're working with a team of people that
grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sure, I think much the way Mark
Scaldone mentioned with alcohol
[SPEAKER_11]: prohibition, that it's inevitably likely
that we will find ourselves, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: hopefully really in the least in a place
like with alcohol, where it can be
[SPEAKER_11]: advertised, where it's available
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, to me, alcohol is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a safe drug.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has an LD50.
[SPEAKER_11]: It can kill you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's dangerous for children.
[SPEAKER_11]: It affects your mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: It affects your liver.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a huge social tear, in my opinion,
a tear on the social fabric of our
[SPEAKER_11]: communities.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I'm jaded because I grew up in an
incubator of alcoholics, not my family,
[SPEAKER_11]: but the community that I grew up in was
just like, let's just drink as much as we
[SPEAKER_11]: can.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it turned me off of alcohol in a big
way.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think prohibition, sorry,
Sam, let me just finish my thought.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think prohibition is going to be much
like when it ended with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember for close to 20 years,
when alcohol prohibition ended,
[SPEAKER_11]: you could not have a sign in your window
that said beer.
[SPEAKER_11]: All the way today, I hope it doesn't take
20 years, but here in Canada, we have
[SPEAKER_11]: legal, medical, the packaging has to be
like blank.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the most boring package.
[SPEAKER_11]: It can be directed at children,
which basically means you can't have signs
[SPEAKER_11]: or characters or anything that definitely,
you know, the cannabis industry would
[SPEAKER_11]: shine in regards to its marketing
portfolio.
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could actually market everyone's
products the way we should be able to
[SPEAKER_11]: market with the clear knowledge that we're
not trying to market to children.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, look at all the characters in
here, Cuban and Tom and skunk man Sam,
[SPEAKER_11]: for God's sakes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm bubble man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we all have like characters that
could be caricatured almost into a brand
[SPEAKER_11]: that is considered here in Canada,
at least like that's marketing to
[SPEAKER_11]: children.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're trying to market to children.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're so worried about children when it
comes to cannabis that they don't seem to
[SPEAKER_11]: care that they're pop and oxy.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my rant.
[SPEAKER_05]: My trouble is I have short term memory
loss.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was going to say something really,
really, really important, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: what the fuck it was.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I cut you off.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to welcome that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I was not correct, but there's a
reason for my stupidity.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, dude, on your on your worst
day, you're a pretty smart guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just say that much.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to welcome Mike West to the
room.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike Mike's like my Mike's not working.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's a bummer when your name's
Mike and your Mike doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's that's something else.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a Mike song, Mike song, Mike song.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know, I saw Mike song in 1993 at
the Commodore ballroom standing right in
[SPEAKER_11]: front of Mike with no knowledge of the
song whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the dark, dismal, dark,
dark Mike song days where it was like they
[SPEAKER_11]: would do the 10 to 10.
[SPEAKER_11]: 10 to 15 minutes of strobe lights jumping
on the tramp like just complete and total
[SPEAKER_11]: madness.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, honestly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: The smoke.
[SPEAKER_14]: They had the mink in hangings.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Did they have these wall hangings?
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: The mandalas.
[SPEAKER_11]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the old wooden speakers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to take it just to jump us over to
a little fish, a world of fish right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was that was the that was the first
time I got denied to go see the Grateful
[SPEAKER_11]: Dead and Shoreline Jerry Band shows in
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_11]: Grateful Dead in Portland was like 93.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I basically drove I drove out west
instead and accidentally saw fish at the
[SPEAKER_11]: Commodore ballroom, which has a floor
that's pushed down on radial tires.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it bounces.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's infamously known throughout Canada as
the bouncing dance floor.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they, of course, did bouncing
around the room because they because they
[SPEAKER_11]: heard about our floor and they play that
song often anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I remembered, which is that
besides having companies like Sagra clean
[SPEAKER_05]: up your plants, the other thing that needs
to be done is cannabis has not really been
[SPEAKER_05]: bred to be mildew resistant to try this
resistant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there has not been serious
breeding towards resistant to disease and
[SPEAKER_05]: pest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the future, that's all anybody will
grow is varieties that are resistant to
[SPEAKER_05]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that once you get delivered a cleaned
up clone, it stays clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't pick it up from the
environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it shows up with the microbiology lab
work that shows the fingerprint,
[SPEAKER_11]: the number, the record that the plant is
the plant that you're getting,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is exactly what Driscoll's does.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guarantee you the banana, raspberry,
strawberry, almond, all those industries
[SPEAKER_11]: will do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: The lab is an integral part of the of the
company, because when you get your tissue
[SPEAKER_11]: culture clones, you want documented proof
that those are the genetics that you're
[SPEAKER_11]: actually acquiring.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish Ian was here today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that he's busy on Sundays,
probably with family, but he can speak on
[SPEAKER_11]: it so well.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Eric is a friend of Ian's as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Ian's just a really knowledgeable cat.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just with him actually visiting with
Skunkman Sam in Amsterdam when we were at
[SPEAKER_11]: the ICRS conference in Leiden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Chimera was there as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was that was an extremely good time.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a good trip doing doing the good
work of the tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a that's a company I consult
for.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sam is actually I believe you're on
the board, aren't you, Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm bored.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm bored indeed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike, can you hear us yet?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_11]: Cuban's going to go rotate his his dogs or
did you already do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I already did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I went downstairs and they're
already out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she's doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's holding it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I totally forgot what it was that I
was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Farmer Tom, you have an awesome beard,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to say it looks good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, that's why he's one of the most
beautiful people in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope my beard ends up like that one day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's got good form, good fullness
and good color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about that tissue culture,
you're definitely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the biggest issue right
now with genetics me coming from,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, Florida, we didn't see any of
those pathogens, you know, and moving to
[SPEAKER_00]: the West Coast as the first time I ever
saw a pathogen like that was when I took a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped from seeds and I dealt with
people that that were also pretty private
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they had their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those pathogens, man, things like a
facarium, I feel is is a real bad one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely can can destroy your whole
program, you know, where you have to start
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the easiest ways to bring this
stuff back, I mean, you could do selective
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning and sterilizing, trying to use as
many beneficials and stuff to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially you can call it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I think that that's kind of
it's not the right angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get good selection that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least your rooms are filled with
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tissue culture is the only way that
I've, through research, have read that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually take those pathogens out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the case of mildew, it's not
systemic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't eliminate mildew with in
vitro work.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you have to do is you have to grow
resistant varieties.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, I guess the thing with tissue
culture is that the mere and we're talking
[SPEAKER_11]: mere stomach micro propagation here,
we're not talking about what 90 percent of
[SPEAKER_11]: the tissue culture world is, which is
callous tissue culture, which is what they
[SPEAKER_11]: do for genetically modifying organisms.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is this is micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's still just cloning.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're cloning just the mere stem,
the tiny little growth site, like a couple
[SPEAKER_11]: of millimeters or whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what's getting put into the
agar medium.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what's getting multiplied into,
you know, four or five or six different
[SPEAKER_11]: clones.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I cut up again.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I guess the way Ian explained it
was when the mere stem is growing,
[SPEAKER_11]: it travels faster than a lot of the
pathogens and microbials and fungi that
[SPEAKER_11]: are trapped in that plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what happens is especially viruses.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you do is you end up growing the
mere stem, cutting it, growing the mere
[SPEAKER_11]: stem, cutting it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's said to be after about three or
four of those runs that you're like ninety
[SPEAKER_11]: nine point nine percent like out of,
you know, those things will be the
[SPEAKER_11]: majority of them will just be gone.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's generally why they're going to
figure out the fingerprint for a dozen or
[SPEAKER_11]: more of the of all these different viruses
and pathogens and fungi so that they can
[SPEAKER_11]: do it through the microbiology lab and
then give you a clean stamp of health.
[SPEAKER_11]: So not only are they giving you the
fingerprint of your plant, but they're
[SPEAKER_11]: also telling you that it's, you know,
based on their company's stamp of
[SPEAKER_11]: approval, that it's not going to have
these these things present.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, you know, it's one thing to
acquire them in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's another thing to be like a Cuban
who comes from Florida and then gets a
[SPEAKER_11]: clone given to him.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just like, yeah, here,
bro, here's like 10 years of pathogens and
[SPEAKER_11]: fungi and microbials I've been collecting
in this impregnated plant through a
[SPEAKER_11]: multitude of vectors.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, good luck with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me know how it works for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like it's so dirty and nasty.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's it's it just reminds me of like
the like venereal diseases or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like, oh, like, bummer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Cuban, one more thing I wanted to say
was that, you know, it's one thing to have
[SPEAKER_11]: your garden decimated by these diseases
and pests.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's even almost another kick in the
nuts to have so many that are present that
[SPEAKER_11]: don't even really create a lot of effects
that you can see.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't necessarily kill the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more like candida in a human where
it's just lowering the vigor.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's lowering the expression of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's lowering the terpene expression.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just all around making that plant
slower, budding less, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: just just attacking it in a way that's not
necessarily killing it, but just making
[SPEAKER_11]: the grow like more of a break,
even if you're lucky than we had a great
[SPEAKER_11]: success.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With most viruses, they are asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got the virus, but all it does is
reduce the health of vigor a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't want it because sometimes
when you have two or three viruses
[SPEAKER_05]: together, they screw the plant really bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have any pests at all,
maybe bad insects, they spread them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the the pathogen that I've had
experience with and we named it the dud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we I've been growing strains for
multiple years, you know, same same
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, because I felt like,
you know how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pop 100 seeds and you find one one
good strain that you put into production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I took that clone and I started
noticing things like the internodal growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and structure was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant didn't grow in the same
structure it was supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost felt like in between the
branching and the main stock that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what that part is called,
that it almost looks like a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have like the stock and the stem
coming out like that, that little part
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be completely not there at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branches would get pinched off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have weed that wouldn't have any
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't have any smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would plant in numbers and I'd
noticed that some of my cuttings in
[SPEAKER_00]: production had it and some didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is years ago, like four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought maybe I had bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I didn't have bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I realized is that by the time I
realized that it was some sort of systemic
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, I had remothered using a sick
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my mothers was a dud and that
already fucked everything up because I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to rotate my mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to really work on like,
I don't know, like you said, 10 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy's STDs, it took me like almost
four to five years to completely get my
[SPEAKER_00]: dud rate at like a 5% maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even completely gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some strains, like the one that I
mothered the dud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that plant never came back ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like three years of trying to
clone this piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like taking 15 cuts, taking the best one,
the one that rooted the best, looked to
[SPEAKER_00]: like kind of grow the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would just dud and veg and looks
like a shrub, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I lost hope in it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: The shrub dud, the shrub dud, AKA the
piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go on ICMAC right now, or sorry,
on ICMAC, there's a thread that's maybe 30
[SPEAKER_00]: pages long on the dud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was crazy that I called it the dud,
but that's exactly what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of theories, but nobody
really knows, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: What they need to do is I guess send like
biomass to a lab to actually have it
[SPEAKER_00]: tested to identify what it is would be
great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to confirm that you have eliminated
most diseases of virus, you need to test
[SPEAKER_05]: that after it's said to be clean,
you can test it and it is clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have the virus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also before you test it, you should
test it and see it does have the virus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I can tell you, I've kept clones
for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you, unless you're extremely
careful, they're going to pick up
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only way that you can be sure is
by either only cloning mothers that don't
[SPEAKER_05]: pick up something or yeah, or have a test
like I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, welcome back, Mike.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You hear me?
[SPEAKER_11]: I can hear you, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you on your phone?
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am.
I am.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike's like tenacious.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like the first computer wouldn't
work.
[SPEAKER_11]: The second computer wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, I'll try my phone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Third time's a charm.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to the room.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike West in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was fun having you here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you get my message on Facebook?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool machine.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't run it myself, but I've heard
good things about them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a ton of different ways of
processing and it goes back into what we
[SPEAKER_08]: were talking about, I guess what you guys
were talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey Mike, try to put your mic a little bit
closer to your mouth.
[SPEAKER_11]: It might make the quality sound better.
[SPEAKER_08]: How does that sound?
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit better.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's passable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as Mark was kind of elucidating
earlier, so a lot of the equipment that's
[SPEAKER_08]: used in the cannabis industry is used in
other industries.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just because you find a piece of
equipment that could be used in processing
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis oils doesn't mean that it's a
novel technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the same way that a broad spectrum of
cannabinoids that hasn't been thoroughly
[SPEAKER_08]: researched, it's difficult to support and
very, very easy to show prior art when you
[SPEAKER_08]: don't have specific ratios of
cannabinoids, specific ratios of
[SPEAKER_08]: terpenoids, and then actually looking at
how they're formulated, how they're
[SPEAKER_08]: processed, and then their use.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've spent a lot of time reading
patents.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you dive into patents, some of them
you can see they're relatively broad with
[SPEAKER_08]: tons of prior art and a ton of patents are
relatively specific.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those specific patents are going to be
the ones that are much easier to protect,
[SPEAKER_08]: enforce, and then the much more stronger
the license out, whereas a lot of the
[SPEAKER_08]: far-reaching patents are going to be more
difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the next part is in the cannabis
industry, a lot of us have taken tools and
[SPEAKER_08]: instruments from other industries and kind
of utilized them or modified them for use
[SPEAKER_08]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we actually scale up as an
industry, you're actually going to see
[SPEAKER_08]: those factors of efficiency grow with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you get the other part of my message,
the last one I sent you?
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got to look on his phone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in regards to what we can talk about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did want to talk a little bit about
this facility that I'm involved with here
[SPEAKER_11]: on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely kind of the dream quiver
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like for me, everyone knows me as a
solvent-less guy, most focused on bubble
[SPEAKER_11]: hash, you know, water extraction,
dry sifting, rosin, and maybe a little bit
[SPEAKER_11]: of like terpene extraction, you know,
some vac steam distillation or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I was approached by a group
that had this real interest in building
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of like a really great facility
beyond and above just what I do,
[SPEAKER_11]: but also basically all of the options in
Canada that would be allowed legally on
[SPEAKER_11]: the federal level.
[SPEAKER_11]: So CO2, cryoethanol, the isolation of
crystallized CBDA and THCA.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every type of extraction and
concentrations have an interest in doing
[SPEAKER_11]: so.
[SPEAKER_11]: I called Mike up because I know that he
has an extremely good background when it
[SPEAKER_11]: comes to both cryoethanol.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been doing that for 20 years or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then CO2 as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's done thousands of runs of CO2s from
the small ones to the big ones and
[SPEAKER_11]: everything in between.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we got to walk through the facility
recently here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was pretty inspirational,
wouldn't you say, Mike?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, beautiful facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an old biomedical biotech warehouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you look at it, one of the things
that I see a lot is people utilizing
[SPEAKER_08]: repurposed buildings that weren't doing
medical processing prior.
[SPEAKER_08]: So being able to find buildings that
already have a lot of the prerequisites
[SPEAKER_08]: built out, clean rooms, sterility levels,
and then in that case, having multiple
[SPEAKER_08]: walk-in refrigerators and freezers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it had three of them, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Two freezers and a fridge, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Two freezers and a fridge.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just a really exciting project.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of fume hoods as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: A very exciting project that possibly
we're hoping that Mike is going to join us
[SPEAKER_11]: on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've got a whole group of different
people, this incredible people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to mention the guys at Whistler
Technologies who have been spending the
[SPEAKER_11]: last year and a half to two years
designing industrialized, large-scale
[SPEAKER_11]: water extractors that don't affect the end
outcome of the quality.
[SPEAKER_11]: So still producing multi-screen
filtrations, doing freeze drying,
[SPEAKER_11]: the final product.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you guys saw on Instagram
recently, I was at Whistler Medical and we
[SPEAKER_11]: were running a batch.
[SPEAKER_11]: We did a whole day, five hours worth or
whatever, and we made two kilos of dried
[SPEAKER_11]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in the small unit, a 250 liter,
but they also do like 500 and 1000 liter
[SPEAKER_11]: units.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were walking through this facility
and it's a big facility.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's 45,000 square feet and the
whole thing is going to be an extraction
[SPEAKER_11]: lab, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was just like two kids in a candy
store, really.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like hop, skipping and jumping
through this facility.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we walked through it for four hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember at the end of the day,
I looked and it was like thousands,
[SPEAKER_11]: was it 10 or 15,000 steps?
[SPEAKER_11]: And eight or nine?
[SPEAKER_08]: Nine floors, yeah, 12,000 steps.
[SPEAKER_11]: And nine kilometers.
[SPEAKER_11]: I walked through that facility.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely something that I'm
alluding to a lot of things because I
[SPEAKER_11]: don't want to say things I'm not allowed
to say.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's still in the very early stages,
but let's just say that it's a very
[SPEAKER_11]: exciting potential project with
cryoethanol capabilities of 10,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Per day, you know, CO2 capabilities of
potentially close to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_14]: Extraction mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ethanol extraction is okay in Canada,
but but butane's not.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the one thing that they're they're
kind of harsh on are the propane and the
[SPEAKER_11]: butane and the gas mixture, so they're
allowed.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're allowed cryoethanol.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're allowed CO2.
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, that's what the majority of of
companies are doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: To get into a little bit of a CO2
conversation, because I've never been a
[SPEAKER_11]: fan.
[SPEAKER_11]: of CO2 and mainly, because the majority of
people that are using CO2, and Mike has a
[SPEAKER_11]: better way of explaining it, and I'll let
him explain it, is just that there's
[SPEAKER_11]: different ways to run the machines.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you just run the machine like
you're just going for cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_11]: then you're obviously going to fuck with
your terpene content.
[SPEAKER_11]: And often people say about CO2,
oh, I just find the terpenes are just not
[SPEAKER_11]: that exciting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not a big oil guy in the first place.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really just kind of smoke rosin.
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe you want to talk a little bit
about the differences in between pulling
[SPEAKER_11]: for terps and pulling for cannabinoids
with the CO2.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like with some forms of steam
distillation and fractional distillation,
[SPEAKER_08]: different classes of terpenes are going to
have different boiling points.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of the times, the early
generations of CO2 extractors were
[SPEAKER_08]: designed to be able to extract the
terpenes and the cannabinoids essentially
[SPEAKER_08]: all in one go.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're seeing is that at high enough
pressure, you can actually get some
[SPEAKER_08]: thermal degradation to those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the same way that when you do
fractional distillation, the high
[SPEAKER_08]: temperatures cause thermal degradation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you look at doing, there's a lot
of research out there that's looking at
[SPEAKER_08]: fractional distillation of chiral
compounds, which are compounds that share
[SPEAKER_08]: the same molecular weight, molecular
structures that just have a different
[SPEAKER_08]: differentiation in where the double plongs
are located.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as the cannabis industry scales up,
we've seen several generations of butane
[SPEAKER_08]: extractors that have been able to improve
the quality of the extracts coming out of
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're starting to see the same thing
come out of the CO2 extractors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that the CO2 equipment manufacturers
have done several generations of
[SPEAKER_08]: instrumentation they've been able to kind
of dial in what parameters work best for
[SPEAKER_08]: whether you're extracting high chirping
content material, high wax content
[SPEAKER_08]: material, or high cannabinoid content
material.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's some cool stuff you can
do with it where you can actually do some
[SPEAKER_08]: superfluid or fractionation using
subcritical CO2 and then supercritical
[SPEAKER_08]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_08]: But ultimately, I think the way that
you're going to want to extract your
[SPEAKER_08]: monocarp knowledge, your low boiling
volatiles is going to be slightly
[SPEAKER_08]: different than the way that you want to
extract your tricyclic cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_08]: So developing efficient and operating
procedures that work well for no matter
[SPEAKER_08]: what product we're producing is going to
kind of really drive increasing
[SPEAKER_08]: efficiencies as well as increasing
quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to talk too much about it,
but it's definitely the quiver of all
[SPEAKER_11]: quivers.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be a monster facility.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll see if Mike is going to join us
in this adventure.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it sounds like something that could be
pretty darn fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm definitely like, my whole mission is
to bring the price down on hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love the fact that some hash is
still expensive, but it's just like,
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish it was more accessible in all the
different wonderful varieties.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wish you could get jars,
giant pickle jars, of hash rather than
[SPEAKER_11]: these little small ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a little dry sift for you,
Cuban.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if that's going to show that
very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Marcus, the water hash machine,
it's a big giant one you were talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about walking through that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Were they batch or continuous operation?
[SPEAKER_11]: They can do both.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can make it a batch or you can
literally get it pretty continuous.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's little bits of breaks in the sense
where the basket that holds all the
[SPEAKER_11]: material inside, like a giant thousand
litre unit, it's got a hydraulic arm that
[SPEAKER_11]: lifts up the basket with all the plant
matter and ice because it's so heavy.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can literally have another one
going right away and have that thing
[SPEAKER_11]: mixing again in minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always knew the future was continuous
operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to have it so it produces the
same quality or better than that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not as hard with water
extraction as people think.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know people were always worried about
running five gallon batches.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they were like, oh, I'm not
getting the quality on the 20.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's like there's simple parameters to
follow.
[SPEAKER_11]: It shouldn't affect you.
[SPEAKER_11]: The process is very simple.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're freezing the wax membranes.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're making them brittle.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you're mixing in a way that
efficiently knocks off the heads and
[SPEAKER_11]: allowing them to sink in the water and
fall on the different screens.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a pretty simple process in the
sense, I think, that's why it caught on
[SPEAKER_11]: just a little over 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually exactly the same as dry
sifting in that most dry sifting today is
[SPEAKER_05]: batch.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm telling you, the future will be
continuous operation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that, Mike?
[SPEAKER_08]: Extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can actually have a milled flour
sent through a tube with a screw.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then ethanol or solvents or CO2 sent
through an opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually just have essentially an
auger that's constantly extracting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to welcome the Dragonfly Earth
Medicine crew into the room, Josh and
[SPEAKER_11]: Kelly.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you guys muted there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You were unmuted.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you're muted.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big love to Green Life Productions down
there in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_09]: Steve Cantwell and crew.
[SPEAKER_09]: Doing it for the Terps.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's nice to see you all this morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's so funny is I came in with this
shirt and Eric is in the room right now
[SPEAKER_11]: and he's wearing the same shirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a sweet shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sweet shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Eric.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice one, Eric.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you guys are at Mid-Harvest?
[SPEAKER_09]: We are.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're smoking out of our stocks.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You all were talking about, you know,
just different vitalities and different
[SPEAKER_09]: plants and strains and selecting the
strains based off their resistance.
[SPEAKER_09]: And everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, that's that's really what
we're doing on our farm here and just
[SPEAKER_09]: learning as much as we can from,
you know, what the plant has to teach us.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we are, you know, students of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, this year we just started all seeds,
a whole lot of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: ones that we've been working on for like
25 years and adding new strains in there
[SPEAKER_16]: and just seeing what we get up here in the
north.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was really it's been a phenomenal
year.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're really stoked.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been gifted seeds from the
Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Himalayan connection and a lot of creams,
given those a try.
[SPEAKER_09]: We went to Jamaica, picked up some really
beautiful seeds out of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_16]: Got some Moroccan strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got some Moroccan chef showing strains
going, you know, some Pakistani purples
[SPEAKER_09]: and then a whole list of, you know,
Hatties from the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I got my select supernatural
selections from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got lots of good Bodhis up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: We love him.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then all of our old outdoor seeds
from, you know, 29 years ago or something
[SPEAKER_16]: like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're still trying to breathe in that
to get early finishers that are just super
[SPEAKER_16]: fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember the white grizzly,
Marcus, from back in the day?
[SPEAKER_11]: The white way back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We kept that around.
[SPEAKER_11]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, another one that I that I never
have seen, but I remember from back then,
[SPEAKER_11]: from the Kootenays in particular,
is the A1 magenta.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you ever hear about that cultivar,
drop that name to some of your old school
[SPEAKER_11]: buddies, because that's one to find.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like it was so special in every
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: That came from Afghani number one that
also threw out magenta and purple plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure, but I suspect.
[SPEAKER_11]: It may very well.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a beautiful, beautiful,
like silvery purple outdoor Kootenay
[SPEAKER_11]: cultivar that was almost like almost like
coffee when you put it in a jar and closed
[SPEAKER_11]: it up, but like not quite.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't know if it was our computer,
but you kind of went out on that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we didn't hear that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't heard of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a robot all day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that a coast cultivar?
[SPEAKER_09]: Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we haven't seen that one.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been working a lot with some hemp
strains and getting some gorgeous magenta,
[SPEAKER_16]: pinks and purples in there and really
trying to up our CBD game.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been doing that for a few years,
but we're going to look for that magenta
[SPEAKER_16]: strain for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the Holy Smokes culture shop guys
like Paul D or Dustin or those guys would
[SPEAKER_11]: probably remember and know it because it
was it was through them that I saw it
[SPEAKER_11]: originally.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we still see those guys all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like 92.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, that's a while ago now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the seeds you got from Morocco and from
India, from the Kulu Valley in that area,
[SPEAKER_05]: if they're pure, you're to look for
Morocco.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not pure.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no pure Moroccan land races
left.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all hybridized with Western
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Manali is pretty much the same story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have pure varieties there
anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we know that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see that in the genetics for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, when we were going around
Jamaica, I mean, that was the biggest
[SPEAKER_09]: thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was just they're all damn near
all hybrids until you get to the seeds
[SPEAKER_09]: that are in like the food cupboard,
you know, and then you find, oh,
[SPEAKER_09]: what's this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got some seeds from like my auntie,
you know, or my grandma.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, this one, you know,
those are the ones that are like the super
[SPEAKER_05]: lengthy 30 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you're in luck.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, really, in Jamaica, it's like
there's this there's a main situation that
[SPEAKER_11]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're looking to go hang out with some
old school like Shanti or Nyabengi like
[SPEAKER_11]: Rasta elder who's like super tall,
lives in the bush, doesn't even have a
[SPEAKER_11]: house.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that guy has the sativa that's like,
you know, 12 feet tall that he's growing
[SPEAKER_11]: that those are the seeds that you want to
find from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're so rare that finding that guy
could take weeks, literally weeks of a
[SPEAKER_11]: trip of just one spot to another.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, multiple trips, multiple trips if
you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you got to earn that to get in
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is earned because you got to do so much
driving.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need to jump into Jamaica and
get the prize.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it should take time.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I did my seed collection in the 70s,
it wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't everybody was not taking
seeds everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was completely different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it started a little bit in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_05]: But most every place else, there was no
pollution, primarily what's polluting the
[SPEAKER_05]: rest of the universe is wild leaf drug
varieties that just crank out resin by the
[SPEAKER_05]: wazoo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we tend to like those ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you don't want the traditional area
of heirloom varieties.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just I think it's the thing is,
is it kind of like when you're a kid and
[SPEAKER_11]: then you're not a kid anymore and you're
like, oh, I want to be a kid.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, no, those days are gone.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like that's kind of like it's this
craziness of life where it's just like
[SPEAKER_11]: these little snippets of like,
wow, it'll never be like that again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll never be like that again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it just keeps happening and going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yet at the same time, I feel like I'm
smoking great cultivars.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like I'm enjoying the resin that I
have, the dry sift, the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I feel like things are still pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, even when we went to Jamaica the
first time together, Sam, I can't remember
[SPEAKER_11]: what year that was.
[SPEAKER_11]: It must have been the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, that was very deeply wild leaf
drug cultivar contaminated by then.
[SPEAKER_11]: We still made killer hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you remember that shit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually very wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was little to no seeds at all in
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was properly grown and it was vastly
majority for people called sativa
[SPEAKER_05]: narrowly.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I really, really liked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought mine was slightly better,
but I had no trouble smoking the water
[SPEAKER_05]: hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: My dry said yours was slightly better,
but I would say that the fact that we made
[SPEAKER_11]: hash that was almost on point with your
dry sift with a five gallon bag of bubble
[SPEAKER_11]: bags and some herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_11]: I still get props.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we made like an ounce of it in like
20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are my memories.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll never forget making water hash with
skunk man Sam in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: And even though the even though the old
drug cultivars are you know, maybe gone
[SPEAKER_16]: and the purity of the land races are gone.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we know that we're still pulling out a
lot of those, you know, old chemo types
[SPEAKER_16]: and phenotypes, you know, out of those we
we've got plants right now that are like
[SPEAKER_16]: easily 1614 to 16 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_16]: These beautiful lanky.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like this right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, just because we have to light
depth them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that means that they're in a
greenhouse, which means they just want to
[SPEAKER_09]: just go like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So with our Moroccans, we we definitely
saw that they were hybrid.
[SPEAKER_09]: They definitely finished like outdoors
here without any light, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: manipulation, which I wouldn't expect
from, you know, a local land race.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fairly early.
[SPEAKER_05]: What they used to eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you got to remember the hash
industry only came to Morocco in the 60s
[SPEAKER_05]: in the early 60s.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, you know, it made good hash
and it finished early.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the Milan is that we got there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see some of the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_09]: But for sure, we got some that were just
numbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, they're they're crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just like serpents, you know.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I got to ask you, Sam, we had some
cultivars that were specifically from,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the Kulu Valley that somebody
had sent us.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's just some things that I had
never seen before.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just wanted to ask you.
[SPEAKER_16]: So when the new leaves are coming out,
you know, like the new growth are coming
[SPEAKER_16]: out, they're so thin that it almost looks
like they're growing out dying.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then as soon as the leaf opens up and
it turns into a beautiful sativa leaf,
[SPEAKER_16]: but they're so like dainty, it almost
looks like, whoa, what's going on with
[SPEAKER_16]: this plant?
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you realize that it was all of
the cultivars that we had gotten from the
[SPEAKER_16]: same area that we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you seen that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, in the Himalayas, it's really
common.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, most of the most of the cannabis
cultivated in Manali, Kulu and Paravati
[SPEAKER_05]: area around there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even, well, cashmere.
[SPEAKER_05]: They imported seeds from from Pakistan and
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the further south where the area
you're talking about, they they were
[SPEAKER_05]: Himalayan varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what they used to rub hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I did see what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Moroccan, you know, just really
dropped its leaves and just did like a
[SPEAKER_09]: crazy molting thing towards the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was super interesting.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, as if as if the Moroccan was just
like mulching itself.
[SPEAKER_16]: It went through three different cycles of
all sun leaves and it dropped all the sun
[SPEAKER_16]: leaves, re-grew them back, dropped them
and then re-grew them back.
[SPEAKER_16]: Really amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And all of the seeds that we had did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I've grown maybe a dozen
Moroccan varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never found any that I thought were
truly, truly stellar.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have really, really high critical
standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: So turpines, yes, but just plain brute
force, not especially.
[SPEAKER_11]: In regards to Morocco in the 60s,
would that have been the Nigerian Mustafa
[SPEAKER_11]: who came with a Lebanese screening
technology?
[SPEAKER_05]: He was Algerian.
[SPEAKER_11]: Algerian.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, I like to I knew that you would know
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's something that people should
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, props to Mustafa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Went to the farmer who he first worked
with.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_05]: When all that was being grown was teeth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Teeth was huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had been there for hundreds of years,
but they were not hashish producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mustafa said, hey, you got all this
marijuana or cannabis or whatever he
[SPEAKER_05]: called it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And why don't you make hash?
[SPEAKER_05]: So he showed him how they started making
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I got to Morocco was 71.
[SPEAKER_05]: And already about 10 percent of the
farmers were growing hash rather than just
[SPEAKER_05]: teeth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the main difference is teeth is a
domestic product for Morocco.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashish means you can make cash through
export.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashish.
Hashish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, they cared more about
quality than quality at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they do both.
[SPEAKER_11]: Me and Cuban on the hashish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashish.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is true, you know, we dry sifted
all different types of varieties and the
[SPEAKER_16]: Moroccan dry sift was by far amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, wow, we weren't even doing it when
it was minus zero and it was just falling
[SPEAKER_16]: off and beautiful terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has a really light flavor,
kind of an uplifting.
[SPEAKER_16]: Lemonine, beta cariophylline, just lovely
and really light white colored,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, dry sift.
[SPEAKER_16]: Really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, growing cultivars for all
that time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, you know, I was never a fan of
Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not until a mutual friend of Sam's
and ours showed me Moroccan hash that I
[SPEAKER_11]: was actually like, I was like,
what?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just so melty and so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_11]: But to me, Moroccan hash has always got
this sort of taste like Morocco that I
[SPEAKER_11]: just I guess because I didn't grow up
really with access to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had access to Afghani, we had access to
Lebanese, we had access to Indian and
[SPEAKER_11]: Nepali, which were kind of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we never really had that Moroccan
coming through where I lived.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best hashish in Europe is Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite hash was in high school in the
early 90s in southern Oregon, late 80s.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was called the gold plated black widow
hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was Lebanese, super thin,
light colored.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just like crazy smelling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we used to get this beautiful roll
of hash.
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe Sam, you've seen this before it
was called blonde Afghani hash.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the woman who used to sell it to all
of us college kids were she was really
[SPEAKER_16]: old, like probably in her 70s.
[SPEAKER_16]: And she would roll it out and measure it
never weigh it just the measurement of it
[SPEAKER_16]: was a perfect weight.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was in like a coil.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was so cerebral.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never seen it since.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had it been hand sifted?
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't rubbed, was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you don't ever see rubbed Afghan
hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all dry sifted there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you know, it was it would definitely
was hard enough that you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: they made it into a coil.
[SPEAKER_16]: But when you cracked it off, it definitely
cracked off more like a keith.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good old hashish.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember getting like those quarter
pounds in the white little bags from
[SPEAKER_11]: Lebanon with like either red Lebanese or
blonde Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess they cut the field early.
[SPEAKER_11]: They let the field sit a little late and
you'd get different colors in the resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: But those were always nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I felt like I was right at the end of
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that was in the 80s towards the
end of the 80s.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I went to Morocco in 71,
you could buy a kilo of medium hash for
[SPEAKER_05]: five dollars a kilo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn, five bucks a kilo.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: That just puts a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's bring back five dollar kilos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think any producer would like to
see those prices.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Cuban was shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tom was like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_11]: Five dollar kilos.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also bought kilos of Simsonia in the
mountains in South India.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might have been 73, 74, 75 around that
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three dollars and fifty cents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely seamless.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost as good as the best tie you've ever
had.
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely different genetics and high.
[SPEAKER_05]: But incredible, incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three fifty a kilo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three dollars and fifty cents.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could listen to stories like that all
day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell me more about the old school hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I used to pay a nickel.
[SPEAKER_11]: They would put it on the back of the
truck.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to get the best stuff in Europe
when I first got here was Turkish silver.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pressed through really thin little
slabs, really thin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was almost when you broke it,
it was like mica.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how some really good hash when
you press the dry set or you water hash
[SPEAKER_05]: and you break it when it's a little bit
cold, you know, almost chip like mica.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has almost like a faceted surface to
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_11]: When I first started making bubble and
didn't have the knowledge and I'd have
[SPEAKER_11]: this like beautiful bubble, I'd press it
up in my fingers.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd get these hard little golden pox.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I go to break a piece off with my
finger.
[SPEAKER_11]: And literally the thing would be so hard
that it would go up under my finger.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it would literally I was jamming
chunks of hash under my fingernail.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it happened a few times.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of right up there with rubbing
resin in your eye.
[SPEAKER_11]: You really try not to do it after you've
done it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_11]: But every once in a while, it would catch
you off guard.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, that bubble hash that turned
like hard as a rock.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you played with it, it would soften
up.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you were impatient and you tried to
break it while playing with it,
[SPEAKER_11]: it would still be hard and literally be
like bamboo under the fingernails.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever broken a piece of mica?
[SPEAKER_11]: Not off the top of my head, I can't think.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the pioneers used to use for
windows.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those were the first greenhouse covers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mica greenhouse covers, hey?
[SPEAKER_15]: The Romans used mica to create some of the
first greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucking Romans, hey?
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you'd get some really beautiful
microclimates in that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen some really cool old pictures
from Europe and stuff where they just
[SPEAKER_09]: build rock walls all over town,
like in the Netherlands and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure I've never been there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe you see it when you're there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they could grow peach trees all
in them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I could only imagine with mica or
some kind of reflective thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I would imagine that would bring
out amazing diffused turps and stuff that
[SPEAKER_09]: would come out from the rock.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to see some obsidian
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like central Oregon, like glass
buttes kind of greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's work on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some Wally Penies with obsidian roofs.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the next pure.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pioneers used mica because glass was
too expensive for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was hard in the old few hundred
years ago to produce large flat pieces of
[SPEAKER_05]: glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas mica, you could get at least a
page of paper size mica and then put it in
[SPEAKER_05]: a frame and make windows out of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds really amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot of mica in this area.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't know if I'm still on,
but yeah, it would be cool to make a whole
[SPEAKER_09]: back like wall out of mica too,
because it would reflect and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have like clear mica around here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that sounds really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this stuff I'm talking about is clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like used for windows, not
reflection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the pioneers used to use it because
they could get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably the good way to decide.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's accessible.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can get it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's use it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be my windows.
[SPEAKER_11]: From hash to mica, from mica back to hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone want to puff a little bowl?
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe a little turp dip?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to offer up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a trip to Shoshow back in 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: And found the hashish very nice there,
especially as compared to what was
[SPEAKER_02]: available in Tangier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Spain, you could find good
Moroccan, but it was considerably more
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive than what the little town of
Shoshow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's about 3,000 people that live
inside the town.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, good hashish was really easy to
find back in 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's my offering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I want to total change the subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was Eric who put the thought in
my head that instead of calling the black
[SPEAKER_02]: market the unregulated market,
he suggested that we start calling it the
[SPEAKER_02]: free market.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it's what cannabis looks like
when there's no regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's either the free market or the
regulated market, not the black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: On one level, it sounds really good to be
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: On another level, I just remember what
unregulated cannabis when we first started
[SPEAKER_05]: testing it, 70% of it came up sprayed with
poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm mostly just talking about
changing the languaging of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in favor of testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, for medical need,
you really need to know what's in your
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just in terms of political strategy,
if you will, I really want to start
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing the idea particularly here in
America, free market is kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: catchphrase for a lot of people in
politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a good use of that term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the free market.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you got to have some sort of
regulations or you'll end up with some
[SPEAKER_11]: Labrador in your shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone said it in the room, so I had to
say it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should shout them out because it was
Skona Vark.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got some Labrador in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Classic Cheech and Chong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Labrador shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Labrador shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think it's got some Labrador.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's some classic, funny, ridiculous
shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care who you are.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_11]: They had their place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Old Cheech and Chong, they had their
place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wade, we wanted to give you a lot of love
and we're going to be connecting with you
[SPEAKER_09]: momentarily.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got home.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just like, ah, with plants and
everything, but we've been definitely
[SPEAKER_09]: thinking and feeling for you and stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so nice to see you all.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wade, really, really awesome to connect on
this Sunday morning and the rest of you as
[SPEAKER_16]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right back at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel the love and I'll look forward to
hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do like that free market thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that it's important.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not saying free to do and grow however
you want if it's toxic, but a free market
[SPEAKER_16]: for you.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what brought it here.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not necessarily that regulations
are going to stop people from growing crap
[SPEAKER_16]: either.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a consciousness.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel like that's really important.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's so many people that I've seen
stepping up to the plate and bringing
[SPEAKER_16]: their cultivation practices forward and
really saying, hey, this is the way that
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been doing it since 64 or 68 and then
teaching the rest of the community that
[SPEAKER_16]: way.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they came from the free market and
they did it within beautiful integrity
[SPEAKER_16]: from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's kind of calling it out like it
is.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, in this time of transformation
into regulation, it's kind of like extreme
[SPEAKER_09]: takeover.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost like a reality show where it's
called extreme takeover.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've taken over the whole entire
industry with these mind blowing
[SPEAKER_09]: regulations that just change all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we talk to farms with our peer
certification often.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we hear stories of years.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just talked to some beautiful people
yesterday in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's taken them three years to get
their registration and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's not a lot of freedom in that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll play.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we want to be able to move forward
into the future and have safety and
[SPEAKER_09]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: It all is what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's an interesting.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's important.
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe that it's really important.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of us, the cannabis culture is the
only culture that we have.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've lost so much of our culture.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I identify myself as somebody who's
part of the cannabis culture and part of
[SPEAKER_16]: not only that movement, but also it's a
family of people.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe with the regulations and all
this corporate cannabis, a lot of that
[SPEAKER_16]: culture is going to be lost.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's really important that the
free market and the elders and the people
[SPEAKER_16]: that have brought this plant forward
continue with the culture.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the culture is what has given
cannabis all of the medicinals that it has
[SPEAKER_16]: given us in our own culture, as well as
our free thought.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, I could go on and on with the
gifts that it's given us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the culture is going to change
guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hear what you're saying in the sense
of protecting the roots of the culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's interesting, too, because the
culture has always been almost in a
[SPEAKER_11]: closet, really, literally, whether you're
growing it or smoking it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not the people on this panel.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're very out with it and we're the
proponents and the voices of promotion of
[SPEAKER_11]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's so many people that have an
appreciation for this plant that are more
[SPEAKER_11]: like, don't want people to know.
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't really grabbed the cannabis
horn by the reins.
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't really looked.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost like the the immigrant,
you know, patriot argument, like where you
[SPEAKER_11]: have your person who's from that country,
but then they're like, they don't want
[SPEAKER_11]: immigrants come into their country because
they took our jobs.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's the same sort of thing with this
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Industry that you have all these new
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, the cannabis industry for
the whole time I've been involved has been
[SPEAKER_11]: like, let us be normal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let us be normal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let us just be a part of all the other
systems.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's let this just happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let this not like don't stop kicking our
doors in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop taking our kids away.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just let this happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then all of a sudden they listened and
it was like, OK, let it happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to let it happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now now they do it the way they do
everything, which is overregulate it,
[SPEAKER_11]: control it, tax it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now people are like, oh, my God,
I can't believe they're doing this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's attracting a whole different
group on one side.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate the regulations.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate, you know, I like that things that
people consumers are protected via certain
[SPEAKER_11]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think treating cannabis like plutonium
with biometric scanners to get into vaults
[SPEAKER_11]: that are three foot thick is absurd and
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: And cannabis doesn't need to be,
you know, people don't need to be
[SPEAKER_11]: protected from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Therefore, like a simple fence and a
security system is more than enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: It shouldn't have to be treated like
plutonium.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the main point on what I was saying
was now with our community, the way we had
[SPEAKER_11]: this roots community, I almost feel like
if you were back in the day at the old
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis cups in Amsterdam, like that was
that was originally what I kind of knew
[SPEAKER_11]: was the cannabis community, the core
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew there were many other groups all
around the world that connected to that to
[SPEAKER_11]: that group.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not everyone could make it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that was this group.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they met every year.
[SPEAKER_11]: They flew from all over the world and they
came and they congregated and they met and
[SPEAKER_11]: they smoked and they created together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you have this whole other group of
people that aren't from necessarily that
[SPEAKER_11]: culture there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have they're from all these other
different cultures and they're coming in
[SPEAKER_11]: much like it's a Canada in the sense that
everyone's welcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, yeah, it's the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, of course, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pick it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do something great with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like bring bring something new to to the
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Grow great cannabis, make great extracts.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have so many people involved that
it's hard for the people who are at the
[SPEAKER_11]: core of it for so many years.
[SPEAKER_11]: To not feel threatened by what's happening
because suddenly, you know, your private
[SPEAKER_11]: game has become very public and everyone
can play.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll say this in a sense that,
you know, the smaller the number of
[SPEAKER_11]: people, the easier to compete is when you
bring in like large numbers.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, who the exponential
difficulties of that when suddenly people
[SPEAKER_11]: who you're like, they may have not been
doing it for the last 25 years,
[SPEAKER_11]: but, you know, maybe they're plant
biologists or agriculture students and
[SPEAKER_11]: they come in and absolutely just crush it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen people that have never made hash
in their life.
[SPEAKER_11]: Take the bags, put their own herb that
they grew into the bags and come out with
[SPEAKER_11]: basically hash on anyone's level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what I call the nicest hash basically
that you can make in the world,
[SPEAKER_11]: whether it's some skunk man, Sam hash or
some Cuban grower or whoever.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's as nice as it gets.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you get to that level, it's as nice
as it gets.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's, uh, it's true.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I think that what you're saying is
really, it is sort of true.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, you can look at it as the
cannabis culture is worldwide,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, no matter where you go in the
world, you can find people and they may
[SPEAKER_16]: not look like you and they may not speak
the same language at you as you,
[SPEAKER_16]: but you still have this love and the
sharing of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe that that's also part of the
cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it is worldwide.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a love of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't mean that you have to cultivate
the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't mean that you have to grow it
or, or, or make hash or be around it all
[SPEAKER_16]: the time.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, it's a love for it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a true respect for it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when I talk about, you know,
the culture of cannabis, it's,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's a respect for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do believe that there are corporate
entities that do maybe have an
[SPEAKER_16]: unbelievable respect for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think when I talk about the culture
of cannabis, it's, it's a respect for not
[SPEAKER_16]: necessarily being a part of, you know,
a group of people or a certain group of
[SPEAKER_16]: people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and you can't live in the past in the
sense like, you know, it's, it's never
[SPEAKER_09]: going to be what it was, you know,
and, and maybe we can look at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I remember now, I remember what it
was like now in 2018, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and maybe in like 2028, like who the hell
knows what we're looking at then.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, that's part of like the enjoy
the journey.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, here we are, you know,
we have these crazy regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, it's kind of like harsh.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, part of our, our peer
certification and the group of farmers
[SPEAKER_09]: that we're working with, you know,
we've worked really hard to keep a quality
[SPEAKER_09]: from that generation before.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of our ancestors to keep that
quality moving forward, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: within this new regulated market is
extremely important to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, big love to, you know,
the, the pure farmers out there that are
[SPEAKER_09]: doing amazing work.
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, I think that people who in a
part of the culture have a responsibility
[SPEAKER_16]: to help teach the people who are just
stepping into the industry, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: how to have respect.
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody's invited.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not exclusionary.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you love cannabis, you can be part of
the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that it's up to us to really
share what it has meant for us to be a
[SPEAKER_16]: part of the free market and to be,
to bring the respectful part of cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we would like to, you know,
give special love to Heart Rock Mountain,
[SPEAKER_09]: who just came on and, and they're really
amazing and check them out online.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're 50 years of cultivation with the
whole family there and they're in
[SPEAKER_09]: Mendocino and they're, you know,
moving forward in this new paradigm,
[SPEAKER_09]: keeping family alive, keeping culture
alive, keeping this cannabis alive,
[SPEAKER_09]: breeding, moving in the, moving forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm really just really stoked to see
this group grow and be a part of the
[SPEAKER_09]: future.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's not just a pharmaceutical
style.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny when I think of the free
market, I think of Oregon where the prices
[SPEAKER_05]: are so cheap.
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost is for free in the market.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_11]: No Oregon farmer was laughing at that
humor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question for Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do you think, how many
generations or years do you think it would
[SPEAKER_02]: take for an acclimatized cultivar to
become a land race in a place like
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt County or, or British Columbia?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these land races, obviously part
of their stability is for maybe thousands
[SPEAKER_02]: of years, the plants were just breeding
amongst themselves right in an area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones that were flourishing were
the ones that did well in that
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something you've talked about
before, Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wonder how long would, how many
generations would it take for a stabilized
[SPEAKER_02]: seed line to be, that was acclimatized in
a climate area that was widely spread to
[SPEAKER_02]: become a land race?
[SPEAKER_02]: How would that work?
[SPEAKER_05]: What has to happen is there has to be
enough generations that any of the more
[SPEAKER_05]: off or different ends of the gene pool are
basically more eliminated and what you
[SPEAKER_05]: have left are slight variations of the
same song.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that can take thousands of years or it
can be done actually in a few hundred,
[SPEAKER_05]: probably in a decade by people with human
selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they pay very close attention to the
plants, and import materials into that
[SPEAKER_05]: area, which are consistent with the
environmental conditions there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just noticed that there's no set amount.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really up to the specific area.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, if you want stuff to grow up
in Alaska and become a land race there,
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say good luck and lean towards
really, really early varieties to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just noticed that Sam, Sam has a apex
vaporizer on his lap from a bird.
[SPEAKER_11]: The bird is the word.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look really, really close at his
face, Sam's face, he's totally,
[SPEAKER_05]: totally spaced out on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guy looks baked.
[SPEAKER_11]: God, I'm exhausted.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tired.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to bring up some cool stuff that
I guess pop in on Instagram with the
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin, the sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diet Funk put it out there and I started
seeing a lot of, I don't produce much
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make head stash here and there,
but the people that are producing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see what they're doing and
they're effectively separating the turp
[SPEAKER_00]: layer from the THC without a second press
using a jar and creating a head pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: with just the terpenes in slight heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it'll separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are getting pretty awesome
crystal formations that are more than just
[SPEAKER_00]: like what the applesauce was with the BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one step closer to what
non-solvent can do versus hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that maybe the pinnacle of a oil
extraction was being able to separate and
[SPEAKER_00]: create that sauce that a lot of the BHO
guys was making, but to see high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 micron being pressed out and then that
being separated and looking like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting close to that level, to me,
I think that's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your thoughts were on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you've been pressing a lot of
rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that I would be concerned
about is does it lower the terpene content
[SPEAKER_05]: of what you're smoking?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're only smoking the diamonds or the
pearls or the caviar or whatever you call
[SPEAKER_05]: it, it's crystallizing out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean that the terpenes are free
liquid and you're not consuming the
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes in the same ratio as it came in
the herb or what you pressed?
[SPEAKER_14]: Those THC 8 diamonds usually typically
have between 5% to 10% terpenes in them.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're infused with terpenes just
dripping with them.
[SPEAKER_14]: You definitely get a full entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're pressing that and you're getting
10 grams of THC and one gram or two grams
[SPEAKER_05]: of terpenes when you press it and then it
separates out, that means there's now less
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene in the ratio than there was when
it started.
[SPEAKER_10]: No denying it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam, you would like to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it looks beautiful and it's pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've smoked it and it's definitely
different.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the exact same.
[SPEAKER_11]: The one thing I would say is, and Mark,
you could correct me if I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_11]: but although it's a solvent-less thing,
it is still using hydrocarbons to produce
[SPEAKER_11]: that effect which is the terpenes within
the profile that's creating that
[SPEAKER_11]: separation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just going to say with butane,
the key to sauce production or trying to
[SPEAKER_14]: get that is first of all using fresh
frozen materials.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't normally make live resin or you
can't normally make it from live resin.
[SPEAKER_14]: The live resin is typically always from
fresh material and fresh material just has
[SPEAKER_14]: a huge load of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_14]: The key thing I think in crystal growth is
that a non-polar environment is always the
[SPEAKER_14]: best environment to have when you're
trying to grow crystals like THCA.
[SPEAKER_14]: Certainly, as the butane boils off,
what you're concentrating now is the
[SPEAKER_14]: terpenes and recognize that each
individual variety of cannabis is going to
[SPEAKER_14]: have a different terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_14]: Each one is different.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not all strains of cannabis are going to
be ones that when you start getting the
[SPEAKER_14]: crystallization, it's basically going to
be completely solvated by the THCA is
[SPEAKER_14]: going to be completely solvated so you
won't get crystallization.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or in other terpene profiles where the
terpene profile is dominated by more
[SPEAKER_14]: non-polar terpenes, you are going to start
seeing crystallization, the so-called
[SPEAKER_14]: diamonds.
[SPEAKER_14]: But those diamonds, those THCA crystals
are just thoroughly and completely
[SPEAKER_14]: perfused with terpene so there's no
mistake about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just crystalline white vanilla
THCA.
[SPEAKER_14]: That they're getting out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just wanted to comment that my
experience has always been with butane
[SPEAKER_14]: extraction, Cuban, so I'm hearing about
this method for the first time.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know about this pressing and
using the terpene head pressure,
[SPEAKER_14]: I think is what you said, to fractionate
the sauce from the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_14]: But certainly the one thing that I've seen
before is absolutely pristine and pure
[SPEAKER_14]: THCA by NMR analysis.
[SPEAKER_14]: With no other impurities in there that's
derived from a second pressing.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we use to hydrogenate to make
this batch of HHCA in Chris Barone's lab.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we looked at that material by NMR and
it was absolutely pristine and pure.
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I was the one who was very much
skeptical that you could make THCA solid.
[SPEAKER_14]: But what you find in the hang up in the
rosin bags, and everyone has seen this
[SPEAKER_14]: now, is that white crystalline material
which people have thrown away for years
[SPEAKER_14]: has been THCA solid, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's funny, I just think
it's like how this whole thing has
[SPEAKER_14]: evolved, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: From when we first started about pressing,
talking about pressing rosin here on Ash
[SPEAKER_14]: Church and evolved to now it's been
sophisticated enough that we can actually
[SPEAKER_14]: really get a reasonable production yield
on pressing like you said.
[SPEAKER_14]: They either sift or flour itself to make
rosin for the market.
[SPEAKER_14]: That would, again, rival that of a butane
solvent extract.
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want to go ahead, Kevin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I hear myself more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that with BHO, they use the
pressure from not only the butane but also
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes in a sealed container to
create a positive pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this positive pressure, when you break
that surface tension in the oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does over time is it promotes the
THCA to begin to crystallize if the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning product is pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimum of waxes and things like that will
begin to crystallize and then the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction will separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the beginning starting material does
not necessarily change because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: trapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you get after it's done is kind of
like a pressure release.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some smell, but it's small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say maybe not even 0.1 or 0.2
gram that I think you would lose in this
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from working alongside with
somebody that produces quite a bit of oil
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeing this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought that that would be a
crazy method for rosin, but because I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't quite understand how to create that
fraction or because rosin waxes so fast
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't get that liquid layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these guys have been able to achieve
just that by pressing out their high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend just made it with some 45,
but a lot of these guys are pressing 90
[SPEAKER_00]: micron first wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting this oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're flash heating it to go past the
wax phase and back to a liquid phase in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed container.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll put it back to about 90 degrees
and they'll leave it for about two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, without any agitation on
this rosin, it will begin to crystallize
[SPEAKER_00]: the THCA just like it does with BHO,
but not at that degree where some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are getting like four carat diamonds.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: How big are the crystals?
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they really, are they long or just
small little like nacho crystals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, some people are, everyone's doing
like reaching different degrees of
[SPEAKER_00]: crystallization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are getting a elongated crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have the facets and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others are getting like a nice sauce
consistency where they're getting small
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like micro diamonds, but the
fraction is so liquidy that it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So All Greens is doing it really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All Greens Extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a nice Instagram and they're
sharing information.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they posting data too?
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they showing data to these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I think would be closest to
show data would for sure be All Greens
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have a dispensary in Colorado
and they do a lot of in-house production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that we can probably get him
to do some testing because he's one in the
[SPEAKER_00]: forefront of that technique, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one that released that,
that's doing a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge dropping is Diet Funk on
Instagram, but it's totally sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Terpenes, Skunk Man, they don't
necessarily escape in the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you take a dab, you can't just get
just crystals unless you strain the
[SPEAKER_00]: crystals and the terp fraction and
separate it willingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, regardless, those crystals are
saturated in terpenes, like literally
[SPEAKER_00]: dripping off of those crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the smell and the taste is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it doesn't lose any flavor at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell when it starts to lose the
terpenes because the consistency changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of dries out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you keep it sealed,
the terpenes have nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of yield are they getting,
do you know, Kevin?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but we can go ahead and
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently tried to do it with some
strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got great results, but I put so much
rosin in a four ounce ball jar that I blew
[SPEAKER_00]: two lids because of the pressure that was
accumulating in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like tightly sealed and it kind of warped
the lid out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps!
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, seriously, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a chamber and you were able to
like maybe pressurize it with nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might get like faster results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's again where the downfall
may be.
[SPEAKER_14]: And ultimately some of these methods which
are using ball jars, which just aren't
[SPEAKER_14]: meant for these kinds of pressures.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, these things are meant for canning
vegetables and fruits and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And certainly can take some pressure
because in that process, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: in the canning process, you generate some
pressure, but certainly that's an area
[SPEAKER_14]: where I believe in Denver now there's been
Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_14]: This would be the fire department's issued
some edict about using ball jars for doing
[SPEAKER_14]: that incubation of sauce.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are a couple of companies that
are now providing so-called spots,
[SPEAKER_14]: which are basically just stainless steel
vessels that have pressure regulation on
[SPEAKER_14]: top and a way that you could vent
pressure.
[SPEAKER_14]: And certainly the way that these things
look, they're look like cannons that are,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, over, you know, engineered for
pressures way higher than you would
[SPEAKER_14]: generate.
[SPEAKER_14]: But what you're talking about here is an
alternative method to make similar
[SPEAKER_14]: concentrate without having to deal with
those kinds of safety issues.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're talking about using butane,
which as it off gases, yeah, it does
[SPEAKER_14]: create pressure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is exactly what the Terps are doing
in the jar, which are also hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: The terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Cuban.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a ball jar, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm making this with my rosin press at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't have a lab, but if I
did, I will get with a fabricator,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a vessel made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that vessel not only would it be able
to hold four times the pressure of a ball
[SPEAKER_00]: jar safely, but I feel like pressure and
the purity of the product is what will
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve those like bigger TCA formations
or at least can separate the term fraction
[SPEAKER_00]: completely, even if those crystals aren't
huge, but it'll be completely separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some samples of BHO sauce that
has been made under pressure in a vessel
[SPEAKER_00]: and the term fraction is completely
liquidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no comparison looking at something
that is using just the head pressure of
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes and the butane versus
something that's been pressurized and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that and rosin will also
make a big difference, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone's tried that yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the rosin or the extract or whatever
it is that you're starting with to make
[SPEAKER_05]: crystals, if it's under pressure,
does it produce a higher yield of crystals
[SPEAKER_05]: or a faster yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could essentially produce both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard claims where like for example,
on BHO, for it to crystallize,
[SPEAKER_00]: they put it in its liquid state,
not a shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't allow it to dry to that state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could take under its own pressure
that it creates in a sealed container
[SPEAKER_00]: about five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people that say that within
48 hours in a pressurized vessel that they
[SPEAKER_00]: get that complete separation of the THCA
crystals and the term fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the yield normally no matter is
the same at the end, maybe the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure will create more yield because
they get that even more separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less THCA and the term fraction,
the more liquidy it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more in that realm, what they're
focused on because they're so beyond that
[SPEAKER_00]: already is the size of the crystal,
how clean the crystal is, the clarity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like in their own zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're getting in the beginning
steps of where they were six months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or nine months ago with Rosy, which is
cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you get crystals that are yellow or
red?
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, THC when it's absolutely
pure and not broken down at all,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's as clear as water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with THC like an oil, alcohol extract
or something, it slowly starts turning
[SPEAKER_05]: yellow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it ends up more like a dark red.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's no impurities like chlorophyll
and any of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can people make crystals with color?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the crystals that I've seen as a pure
example of THCA is a clear crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the crystal has impurities,
the crystal will then be yellow perhaps in
[SPEAKER_00]: its pure form from fresh frozen,
not cured material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking material that's never been
dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: What changes mostly with the size of the
resin between an amber head, a clear head
[SPEAKER_00]: or cloudy head is the color of the TURP
fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: A TURP fraction on an amber, like a 70 or
a 45, the TURP fraction will be more
[SPEAKER_00]: amber, but the diamonds will still be
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use a 90 or 120, then you'll have
like a really almost like liquid clear
[SPEAKER_00]: TURP fraction, maybe slightly yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diamonds regardless will be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get a higher yield of diamonds per
gram using a 90 or 120 versus a 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe with age, if you leave this
product out and cure it, potentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: color of the diamond can change because
THC, I mean, naturally ends up turning
[SPEAKER_00]: into almost red.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does turn red.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got resin heads, which I just kept
aside for like a year on the open shelf.
[SPEAKER_05]: And within a year or a year and a half,
if the most they were really red.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I remember the dry sift from Michael
that was like, it was 12, 13 years old
[SPEAKER_11]: when I first saw it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think 16 or 17 years old when I last saw
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when it melted, it melted into this
like reddish, dark black obsidian,
[SPEAKER_11]: like just oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was definitely no TURPs left.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back, Mike.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have something you want to say about
this sauce?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Mark probably didn't talk about this,
but I would assume that that general trend
[SPEAKER_08]: of coloration is going to be oxygen
binding to not only your cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_08]: but all the TURPinoids that occur in your
sauce.
[SPEAKER_14]: Flavonoids are really highly colored and
are very prone to oxidizing in air and
[SPEAKER_14]: they'll oxidize.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you stare cross-eyed at them,
they're that unstable.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so just even on the rotavap,
what comes out as a clear extract will
[SPEAKER_14]: start to turn yellow as you concentrate
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other thing I've seen,
again, just putting stuff on the shelf,
[SPEAKER_14]: certain terpenes, when you isolate them
first, have basically little to no color.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're isolating them under vacuum,
or if you're isolating them by some type
[SPEAKER_14]: of distillation process, as soon as they
come in contact with air, as soon as they
[SPEAKER_14]: come in contact, they start darkening up
right away.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think there's, you know, again,
some, you know, oxidative instability with
[SPEAKER_14]: some isolated terpene fractions that
perhaps are kept protected by the
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabinoids in the plant itself,
because remember the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_14]: themselves are phenolic in nature and
phenols are antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_14]: So perhaps when they're in the plant,
the cannabinoids act as a photoprotectant
[SPEAKER_14]: or a protectant from oxidation of the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_14]: But when the terpenes are isolated and no
longer, you know, intermingled with the
[SPEAKER_14]: antioxidant...
[SPEAKER_08]: And the phospholipid bilayer on the
trichromic head is going to reduce the
[SPEAKER_08]: amount of oxygen that's actually entering
the trichromic gland, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And isn't that the whole nature of timing
harvest based on resin, gland color?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, right, when we had Mel Frank
on a number of episodes ago, I can't
[SPEAKER_14]: exactly remember how this came up in
conversation, but I think one of the
[SPEAKER_14]: things that I took from Mel Frank's
original text was the timing of harvest
[SPEAKER_14]: and how it's very important to be able to
recognize the change in color of those
[SPEAKER_14]: glands as to try to guess when you're
going to get maximum potency.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think there is some delicate balance
of chemistry that's happening there.
[SPEAKER_14]: The highly colored things I think are
flavonoids because it only takes a little
[SPEAKER_14]: bit of those flavonoids to color a whole
lot of material, because again,
[SPEAKER_14]: most of the terpenes, when you isolate
them on their own, will be clear liquids,
[SPEAKER_14]: but some of them will start immediately
turning color.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't exactly know what's happening
there, but I've seen it happen in front of
[SPEAKER_14]: my eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to go first or should I?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're frozen, so I'll go.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I got pure THC,
100% pure THC, it was THC, I think it was
[SPEAKER_05]: THC, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it wasn't a salt, it was liquid,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was absolutely clear liquid.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had the texture of a sort of runny
epoxy glue and it had absolutely zero
[SPEAKER_05]: taste, zero smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put a tiny drop on your tongue and
taste it like absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was THC because it had been
synthesized from CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think just that processing would
have converted it to THC, but I'm not 100%
[SPEAKER_05]: sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I opened the vial, it was in a little
ampule, a glass ampule with a gram in it
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was packed in inert gas and it had
been kept frozen until it was given to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I opened it and I stuck a little thin
piece of a toothpick or something in it
[SPEAKER_05]: just to see what the texture was like and
so I could taste it on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I found out was that within a few
minutes where I had stuck the toothpick
[SPEAKER_05]: into the THC, it left an ultraviolet trail
through the THC, which started turning
[SPEAKER_05]: yellowish and eventually reddish.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, when I saw that, it blew my
mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, that would have been a great macro
photograph.
[SPEAKER_08]: The moral of the story is pack your
extracts in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah and don't poke your extracts with
toothpicks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the moral of the story is pack them
in small enough vials that you can finish
[SPEAKER_05]: them off when you open them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, it's an interesting
conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty sure Soil Grown's been doing
that for a while, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct, Cuban?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what he achieved is similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a double press and then will
liquefy the THCA fraction that's retained
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has steps that I don't want to talk
about because we're friends, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know him very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we kick tech and shit when I see him
in person and I don't want to put his
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out there that he doesn't talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his process is nice, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets a nice turf fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: His THCA is also pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he does a two-step process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although it's achieving a very similar
end product, this is done with a one-step
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a different technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to him about it when I was down
in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bet in the last three weeks,
he's probably been on that for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, no, I thought he was also doing the
other one as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could be mistaken.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've invited him in, but he's busy today.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to have to get him on next
week, maybe, and further the conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's nice to get together with you
guys and gals and talk hash and cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: and just spend a couple of hours on a
Sunday morning chilling out.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I did that with the pure THC,
I was absolutely convinced that THC would
[SPEAKER_05]: have a smell and a taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could tell there was some gooey stuff on
my tongue.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm so used to all cannabinoids I've
ever had that were concentrated being
[SPEAKER_05]: really, really pepper on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they always had terpenes,
which is where the pepper was coming from.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Beta-carotene.
[SPEAKER_12]: Very ophthalene.
[SPEAKER_11]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do it for the terps.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_16]: Please ask it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sam or Mark, maybe you can help me out
with this.
[SPEAKER_16]: And actually, Marcus, you and I talked
about it.
[SPEAKER_16]: All of us did.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were in Whistler last week.
[SPEAKER_09]: And happy birthday to your wonderful son.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's the dude.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the dude.
[SPEAKER_16]: Marcus has the dude.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I have a question about CBG.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's something that, no matter what
strain that people are giving us,
[SPEAKER_16]: our numbers in CBG are coming up really
high.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the cultivars that we've been
working with for a really long time come
[SPEAKER_16]: up even higher in CBG.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then people will give us a seed.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they'll say, oh, it doesn't have
any CBG.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're growing it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it has CBG.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm just wondering about a cultivated
version of CBG coming up in the plants.
[SPEAKER_16]: Or a possible genetic CBG.
[SPEAKER_16]: What enhances it?
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a question for me.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was wondering if you guys had an idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: We developed CBG varieties that were well
over 10%.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you finding CBG 10% in the flower?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started with varieties that are 1% or
2%.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then through selective classical
grading, we brought them up to over 10.
[SPEAKER_09]: We created a strain called Zele's Gift.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Green Life Productions just sent us a,
the do it for the Turbs family there,
[SPEAKER_09]: did a lab test.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they got theirs back.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a 10.3, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it was on CBG.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it just seems to be, just wondering
about genetic versions of CBG.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it different?
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a lab work.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was probably Zigi Labs.
[SPEAKER_16]: Zigi Labs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So CBG is oftentimes shown in plants early
in flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plants produce enzymes that actually
not only bind terpenes into the precursor
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: CBG is one of those precursor
cannabinoids, CBGA.
[SPEAKER_08]: The breeding that's been kind of going on
developing those higher CBG cultivars is
[SPEAKER_08]: actually delaying the production of CBDA
and THCA synthase, which is the enzyme
[SPEAKER_08]: that converts CBGA to either CBDA or THCA.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you take those cultivars that are
showing 8% to 10% CBG, an additional four
[SPEAKER_08]: weeks, you'll actually see that CBG
numbers decrease.
[SPEAKER_08]: And either your THC or CBD numbers start
to trend upwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it depends what synthases they have.
[SPEAKER_05]: If all they have is a CBG synthase,
and they don't have functional THC or CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: synthases, you don't see THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to have the functional synthase
to produce the end compound from CBG.
[SPEAKER_16]: So do you all believe that the cultivation
practices or the way that the plant is
[SPEAKER_16]: being cultivated can even raise CBG in
possible genetics that don't have it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be surprised.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard people say that they,
oh, I pick it early and the CBG is higher
[SPEAKER_05]: because it hasn't converted to THC or CBD
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's true at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not what we saw.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the work we did was more than 15
years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're the ones who wrote the papers on
the inheritance of CBG and the other.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think the question that she asked
is, can you introduce an environmental
[SPEAKER_14]: stimulus to the plant to upregulate the
expression of the synthase that's either
[SPEAKER_14]: not being present at the right level?
[SPEAKER_14]: Because yes, CBGA is not a N pathway
precursor.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the end of the cannabinoid
biosynthetic pathway, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If the other synthases aren't there,
it is the end.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the other synthases are there.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just not expressed at the level
that they need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, they'd be non-functional.
[SPEAKER_05]: Skunk has CBD synthases, but they're
non-functional.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, but OK, so the question has to be
asked at the genetic level, is there
[SPEAKER_14]: something that can upregulate the
expression of that enzyme?
[SPEAKER_05]: Without the proper synthases, it won't.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have the proper synthases,
maybe it can tweak it a bit, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you need the synthases.
[SPEAKER_14]: The proper synthases are there,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're mistaken.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, you're a chemist.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we should stick to what we're good at.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that I've seen cultivars of CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the synthase is non-functional,
it's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're technically right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's non-functional.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know I've seen a couple of cultivars
of CBD that have been cultivated along the
[SPEAKER_08]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what one of the LED companies I was
researching was claiming was not enough
[SPEAKER_08]: supporting documentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they were saying that their spectrum
was improving the CBD scores because of
[SPEAKER_08]: the higher presence of red spectrum
blight.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some research papers looking at
shifting towards the red spectrum in
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis can produce more of the CBD A
synthase than less of the THC A synthase.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that that's manipulating light
spectrum for producing specific
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoid profiles hasn't been done on a
lot of fields to actually quantify and
[SPEAKER_08]: show it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you want to do is you want to breed
with high expression of the synthase of
[SPEAKER_05]: the target you're after.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving environmental conditions is small
potatoes compared to the big potatoes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, totally agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: It all has to start with the genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have the genetics, then having
those environmental conditions to maximize
[SPEAKER_08]: it will kind of help your, I guess,
genetic selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got 20 kilos of French variety,
Synthica 70, because it's reported to have
[SPEAKER_05]: small amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I picked up 750,000 seeds of it so I
could screen a few thousand.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an industrial headline.
[SPEAKER_09]: With all your experience, Sam,
and testing all the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is it really just the cannabinoids
that we're looking at on the tests that
[SPEAKER_09]: are really of note on a medicinal level?
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to believe that out of the
hundred cannabinoids that are there,
[SPEAKER_09]: that there is so much more to the story.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like I'm at the beginning of this
amazing book or story, and I just want to
[SPEAKER_09]: hear the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like we're growing for cannabinoids
we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would just be interested to know
about how... What you can say for sure is
[SPEAKER_05]: that people wouldn't know that yet,
because there are varieties with high THC
[SPEAKER_05]: that always have been.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are now varieties of high CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: I produced the first one that was over
10%, but that was more than 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are, and now people have
varieties which I think are approaching
[SPEAKER_05]: 30% CBD in a plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did the same thing with CBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it with CBG.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it with the propyl homologs of THC,
CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So THCV, CBDB, CBCV.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, now I forgot what I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how about this?
[SPEAKER_05]: What else?
[SPEAKER_16]: What about CBN?
[SPEAKER_16]: That's something that we've been finding a
lot of.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBN is not directly produced by the
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a degradation product of most
primarily THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: And these grow techniques enhance any
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any lavender grower can tell you that
terroir is going to affect your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, affecting your terpenes are
going to change the effect of the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoid strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true because the right terpenes can
both, and a lot of modulate the effects of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by building more diverse soils that
have more and more and more
[SPEAKER_09]: microorganisms, I just know and I've seen
through testing and I want to see more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And through the family, it's just how much
more diverse it can get.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really look forward to the day when
we can get deeper into the story.
[SPEAKER_16]: And much like our cultivars of our land
races, we've lost our land race soils as
[SPEAKER_16]: well.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've lost that incredible biodiversity in
our soils in the same way that our land
[SPEAKER_16]: races have been lost.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're really trying to bring that back
and create more and more diversity and
[SPEAKER_05]: hopes that it will create cannabinoids and
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soil and lights and other environmental
conditions can certainly affect ratios.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're not going to get a new
cannabinoid with different light or
[SPEAKER_05]: different soil or different water.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have the synthase to be able
to produce that cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally understand that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking more along the lines of just
information about new ones that we just
[SPEAKER_09]: haven't heard about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's not like a list of all 100
cannabinoids and all of their.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: I should probably learn more about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not common through testing with
recreational farms to get those numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've got to remember that some of
the cannabinoids listed like Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's listed as a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not produced by the plant directly.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a synthase for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people agree, Moshulam and Dr. El
Solay and Dr. Roger Fertre.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say that it's a degradation product
of lab analysis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess I'm just saying, I guess I
wish that the lab gave us more information
[SPEAKER_09]: to where we could use that and access that
information so where we could put the two
[SPEAKER_09]: together.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that, Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: They may not know the answers,
the labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing the best they can.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they don't have the knowledge,
then they certainly can't share it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, a lot of the terpene, if you look at
soil microbiology, is there are soil
[SPEAKER_08]: microbes that produce a lot of the
precursors to terpenoid in the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So having biodynamic soil provides those
precursors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will certainly increase the amount of
terpenes that you get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen that myself many, many,
many times.
[SPEAKER_05]: But whether it will create a new terpene
that you have never had expressed before,
[SPEAKER_05]: that, yeah, I have a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have doubts about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, with the variation in indigenous
microorganisms, I mean, I'd have to assume
[SPEAKER_08]: that the microorganisms in Afghanistan
versus Morocco are going to have different
[SPEAKER_08]: ratios of different microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would that then, I guess, different ratios
of microorganisms producing different
[SPEAKER_08]: ratios of terpene precursors are going to
probably slightly affect the terpene
[SPEAKER_08]: expression?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's easy enough to find out.
[SPEAKER_05]: All you do is you grow the same clone in
Afghanistan soil, and you grow it in
[SPEAKER_05]: California soil, Kansas soil, Alaska soil,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if all that's changing is the amounts
of the terpenes found and not new terpenes
[SPEAKER_05]: or different terpenes, then the answer is
no.
[SPEAKER_02]: May I share one thing I've learned is that
you can vary the cannibinoid ratio,
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of CBD to THC, by varying when
you harvest the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've found for a number of high CBD
cultivars is if you want the maximum
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of CBD and the minimum amount of
THC, you would harvest when your trichomes
[SPEAKER_02]: are still clear and a good portion of them
have gone milky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you wait till most of them are
milky and a good portion of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: amber, the CBD levels tend to go down and
the THC comes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you end up creating what was a 30
to 1 if it was harvested while trichomes
[SPEAKER_02]: were still clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns into a 4 to 1 if you wait till
they're amber.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen that much of an extreme
difference, but I absolutely agree with
[SPEAKER_05]: what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it myself in my lab for years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know a lot of the hemp farms are
harvesting early just to prevent that
[SPEAKER_08]: bioaccumulation of the THC.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've even noticed that temperature
changes being greenhouse growers that we
[SPEAKER_16]: are.
[SPEAKER_16]: The maturity can change overnight.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be looking at the heads,
they'll be maybe crystal clear,
[SPEAKER_16]: and then we have a really cold night and
then they all turn amber within hours.
[SPEAKER_16]: So temperature really seems to be a big
part of it as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also very dependent on varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes some varieties, cold
temperatures speed them up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other ones, it slows them down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great conversation today so far,
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's been three hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been rocking it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've spoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: We started on a depressing topic with the
fires, but we always got to cover things
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe even if we don't necessarily think
they're super positive.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we got into a little hash
conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cuban's blasted out, but he was able to
share a little of that solventless sauce
[SPEAKER_11]: with us and that tech.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you guys got those good Instagram
accounts that if you want to go follow,
[SPEAKER_11]: I think All Green's extraction was one and
Diet Funk was another.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Cuban put a couple other ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure he'll shout them out on his
Instagram or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think three hours is pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure the Dragonfly Earth Medicine crew
has much, much work to go do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I correct?
We do.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had minimal sleep lately.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're thankful for it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the harvest this year has been
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_16]: That means food, fruit, all the apples.
[SPEAKER_16]: The apples are coming on at the same time.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got the kids in there canning.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're out here clipping.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all happening.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are just so incredibly thankful.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're really thankful for this day to
be with you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of the higher general temperatures
this last few months?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we've had a combination of high
temperatures and then not so high
[SPEAKER_09]: temperatures only because it's been so,
you know, atmospherically smoky.
[SPEAKER_09]: And most of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it can be as nice as it wants to
outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you don't see the sun, it's not
actually been that warm.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's been pretty stagnant in a lot
of ways, too, with the wind.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been like really kind of minimal
wind and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: We usually have a really good clear of
wind and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, other than that,
it's just the naturalness of just this
[SPEAKER_09]: time of year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're starting to get colder nights.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the plants are maturing and they're
coming in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'll definitely give a hug to Sky
and Sierra.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you guys take care up there in the
coots off Kootenay Lake.
[SPEAKER_11]: What a beautiful lake.
[SPEAKER_16]: And big love to you guys during this
birthday time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And everyone else on the bed and Mark and
Sam and Tom and everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: So nice to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really made our day.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate the conversation.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to recall the last time we saw
each other, which we were texting about
[SPEAKER_14]: it, was my first time going to the Emerald
Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Josh and Kelly said, look for the
teepee.
[SPEAKER_14]: Look for the teepee.
[SPEAKER_14]: The teepee will stand out.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's only one teepee there at the
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: And certainly right after the gate where
you get in and you get your card to go to
[SPEAKER_14]: Medicaid, there is the teepee.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I found the teepee before I found
the innards of the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was hanging out with our friends,
Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Josh, I don't know if you remember,
but you gave me a Kanagar.
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember that Kanagar you gave me?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got that to DelFest this year,
which is a bluegrass festival that I go to
[SPEAKER_14]: in Western Maryland.
[SPEAKER_14]: And during Del McCurry band's Saturday
night set, we smoked that in front of the
[SPEAKER_14]: band.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were looking down saying,
oh my god, look at that thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it a cigar?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it a joint?
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_14]: That thing burned for an hour long.
[SPEAKER_14]: I shit you not.
[SPEAKER_14]: That Kanagar was the coolest gift I think
I've ever gotten by any means.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, there'll be more coming to you for
sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: A gift thanks to Kush Kirk on that one,
Brandon and everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll be rolling up some this year for
sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be bringing them out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: That thing had a fuse to it and
everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was like real healing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we can't wait to giggle with you and
the teepee this year for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the first thing I'm going to look
for.
[SPEAKER_14]: The hell with everything else.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's the teepee?
[SPEAKER_14]: Get me to the teepee.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the entrance.
[SPEAKER_09]: We clear the space.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a spiritual cleansing as you come in
and everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, do tell Trixie that I said hello.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pass on a grateful dead hello and
everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: To our friends out, the grateful dead
family that you guys hang out with.
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_16]: We will let them know.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be seeing them really soon.
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were just with them last week.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll be spending a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Annabelle is a big enthusiast and I
think that they're doing some great
[SPEAKER_14]: things.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to say any things that I'm
not supposed to say, but there'll be
[SPEAKER_14]: announcements later.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those guys are getting involved in a big
way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, look for a mountain girl.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to get Mountain Girl on the
show.
[SPEAKER_11]: I promised her when Hash Church came back.
[SPEAKER_09]: She'll come on and she can tell the story
of her new company and everything that's
[SPEAKER_09]: coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is a charged up group in Oregon
that's really kind of coming together to
[SPEAKER_09]: make things happen there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're really thankful to see them.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll all be in the teepee this year.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to have a whole special event.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a special area for everybody to be
able to show their products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are my people in the teepee.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody know the date?
[SPEAKER_05]: Emerald?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't even want to guess.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_05]: The date for the Emerald Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the second weekend in December.
[SPEAKER_16]: That I know.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's the 13th and 14th of
December.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was close.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it would be great for you to come,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be great to see you there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim has invited me every year and I still
have never been to one.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a great feeling one.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of good vibes there.
[SPEAKER_16]: People with really great information.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just sort of the sharing of the
tribes from all over the globe.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a really high event.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like a good one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to make it one day if I could
ever get back down into the US of A.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were straightening that all
up, Mark, so that you could go.
[SPEAKER_11]: But now they're giving lifetime bans to
people who cross the border from Canada
[SPEAKER_11]: who don't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: All they did was invest in a cannabis
company and they're like, boom,
[SPEAKER_11]: lifetime ban.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to see you guys at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put in a speaker workshop proposal and
we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, much love.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to sign off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, all of you, for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, thanks for coming out, Wade.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to thank you as well as Gunkman
Sam and Dr. Shaldone, as well as Farmer
[SPEAKER_11]: Tom.
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, thanks.
[SPEAKER_11]: And thanks, Eric, who was in earlier under
the name Bridget.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike West, who was also in a while ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Cuban Grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: So everyone, if I forgot anyone,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a long conversation this morning
of interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I learned some things.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to be a part of the conversation in
a way.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was just, as always, a real
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thanks, everyone, for coming out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we'll talk to you next week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.
