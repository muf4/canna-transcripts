[SPEAKER_00]: Hey!
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it!
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it!
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it!
[SPEAKER_00]: That took three tries, just so everybody
knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Bubble Man's world,
everybody, and welcome to the Wake and
[SPEAKER_00]: Bake episode 62.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, of course, still out camping in the
world of beautiful British Columbia,
[SPEAKER_00]: about to head off on a epic, epic
fucking... Oh, I'm not seeing anyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, let's see the chats, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I revived the dab mat today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, excellent, Sven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sven, you haven't been sending me insane
emails, have you, that don't make any
[SPEAKER_00]: sense and, like, talk about aliens,
and I'm getting some crazy emails from
[SPEAKER_00]: this dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could keep going like this all day,
but I suspect we're gonna get another
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred or two hundred people in the room,
so I'll probably just stop right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really fucking good to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely gonna get our Wake and
Bake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake and Bake on, and we're also gonna
give away another dab mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason I've given away the oil
slick dab mats for the last three days in
[SPEAKER_00]: a row is because I'm not writing anything
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit confusing to try and do
work while you're away on a camping trip,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've given away two so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the third one going right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm gonna do a simple pick a
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be between one and fifty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can start guessing right now if
you would like, and we'll be giving a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: mat away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice labor of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, eleven, love the clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight, forty-two, seventeen, seventeen,
thirty-two, forty-three, thirty-four,
[SPEAKER_00]: thirty-three, thirty-two, thirty-four,
forty-five, thirty-six, thirty-three,
[SPEAKER_00]: twelve, eighteen, two, thirty-three,
forty-five, forty-nine, two, forty-eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: thirty, twenty-eight, forty-one,
sixty-six, two, thirty-one, twenty-four,
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty-seven, one, forty-eight,
twenty-five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't said it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we go like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's between one and forty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's between one and forty.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still haven't seen this number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to have my bake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are killing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when you guess first and win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eighty-three is definitely way far out of
the loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we got a poor connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a poor connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go through here and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a number between one and thirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifteen, Rice Amos has taken it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice Amos, you win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifteen is the number I had in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herb Farmer, sorry, you came in a little
bit late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice, if you want to send me an email at
bcbubbleman at iCloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's guessing fifteen now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: bcbubbleman at iCloud dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay, Bud Rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not on my screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phones and the computers are a little
bit different, but don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a ten dollar dab mat and it's
really nothing to be upset about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the inside of the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's get our wake and bake on.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, I just wanted to get the giveaway
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to have a bake with you guys,
have a little conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely don't want to hear any
bitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, we can congratulate the person
who won.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you guessed before them and it
showed up on your screen and it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: show up on mine, it doesn't make me a
dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't try to fuck you over a ten
dollar dab mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I'm probably not going to
stop giving these away until everyone has
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get on with a little glacier
melts today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hit some glacier melts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was super greasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, greasy, greasy, greasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Phil, from Glacial Melts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glacial Melts, not Glacier, for those of
you that think I'm mispronouncing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, of course, I've gotten messages
about that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice when people are willing
to help you out when you make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is super greasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really going to be a nice rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing on some raw gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Lounge Lizard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelo N.O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter S.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as I start to see Josh Warner,
all these names are people that have won
[SPEAKER_00]: things on the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: How fucking cool is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing on Recon O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got home at the correct time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sup?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wake and bake, because I've got to
get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm leaving for home today and I want to
get a four hour ride in still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Dr. Bob said that, have him contact me
or I'll contact him and we'll do it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to do that with Dr. Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a huge inspiration to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, happy birthday, Josh Warner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everything is going good on your
birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: My sound is switching on and off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what can I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very poor connection and we're
lucky that we even have this connection at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not be missing Spannabis 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, I got a lot of emails from a lot
of people asking me, what the fuck were
[SPEAKER_00]: you not doing at the Cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's do this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, birds?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of birds joining me for a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear my friends lighting up bikes
and side by sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock the chas.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just because I'm camping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll clean off very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very minor chas on my bowl right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a matter of doing a little,
a little clean and we'll get that chas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beautiful thing about the DC
glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna give away a bunch of
bottles of that when I get home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the start of the DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have at least 10 bottles to give away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll probably hit up Sasquatch again
and Oil Slick and Mothership and Dab Mats
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if they have an interest in
supplying things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of giving a little thing
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing major, nothing major.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the cleaner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the cleaner is called, nah,
I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting better, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of a, a little bit of a piece
back here I got to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise I'm quite happy with how my
bowl looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the ant glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, probably only really have
time for one rip today as we are about to
[SPEAKER_00]: get going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you guys as always for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many people we have in
the room, but it's probably 100 or 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my Oil Slick shirt on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tools to help you concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fucking great logo he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tools to help you concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, thank you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, my connection's so low it
won't show me what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thanks everyone, honestly,
for coming out and spending time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm getting to know you guys,
all your little avatars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're a good group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take care of the trolls together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just happy to be a little bit of a
part of your day, whether it's morning or
[SPEAKER_00]: evening or night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be loving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking A, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble on and may the full melt bless your
bowl sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis!
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis!
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the life, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo-hoo!
