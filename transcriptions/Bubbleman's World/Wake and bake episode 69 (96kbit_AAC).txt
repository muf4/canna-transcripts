[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we're live a little bit of a sketchy
connection here Probably because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: beside my house and who knows we might
have to move this connection We'll see if
[SPEAKER_00]: we can go live here in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I'm going to try and get a
better connection It says very bad
[SPEAKER_00]: connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys let me know if I'm coming
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the chat still hasn't started over
yonder Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey been a long time since I made a wake
and bake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you made it samurai Sam I

[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my phone's telling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway I'll see what happens if it's gonna
give us some love or what?

[SPEAKER_00]: and simply put Todd McCormick had a good
friend of his living with him at the Bel
[SPEAKER_00]: Air Mansion right before he got busted
that was the the bus that Todd served five
[SPEAKER_00]: years for on Terminal Island and there was
a gentleman who lived there with him and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wearing his face on my shirt today and
if you can tell me what this gentleman's
[SPEAKER_00]: name is you will have won yourself a Oil
slick here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great for pressing rosin or
keeping your rosin on And we'll see what
[SPEAKER_00]: we got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what kind of things we know All

[SPEAKER_00]: So now someone answered the question It's
bouncing all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bouncing all around Wow chat is
moving so fast and no one has answered the
[SPEAKER_00]: question yet No one has has answered the
question yet I'm just gonna keep an eye on
[SPEAKER_00]: the chat until someone can answer the
question of who this gentleman is he was
[SPEAKER_00]: arrested With Todd McCormick at the Bel
Air Mansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an author of over almost 40 books
actually and Yeah, he's sitting on my
[SPEAKER_00]: shirt right here Tell me what his name is
author of almost 40 books self-help offer
[SPEAKER_00]: author I want his full name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want his full name You need to say that
again, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mad laggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well enough people are answering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's probably okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this gentleman's name He lived with
Todd McCormick in the Bel Air Mansion was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some projects with him when the
mansion was busted and That's great that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've given me his first name But like I
said before I want his full name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one name is not gonna cut it Don't even
bother answering if you're just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: guess one single name Keep going guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can't be that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness Michael Jackson in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon from the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have a lot of work to do And your
activism, let me tell you there we go
[SPEAKER_00]: melty heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't spell it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna give it to you because no one
else even came close Melty heads is the
[SPEAKER_00]: winner today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Peter McWilliams Peter McWilliams
was arrested at the Bel Air Mansion Put on
[SPEAKER_00]: bail and told that if he used cannabis
while he was out He would have they would
[SPEAKER_00]: take his mother's house away who of course
put her house up for the bail Peter
[SPEAKER_00]: suffered from non-hopkins lymphoma and
Unfortunately, he passed away by choking
[SPEAKER_00]: on his own vomit as he used Cannabis to as
a natural anti-amedic So very sad story
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to sort of wear Peter's image on my
shirt today and give a shout out to Peter
[SPEAKER_00]: McWilliams All the great work that he did
as well as Todd McCormick and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: meantime Melty heads if you want to send
me an email at bcbubbleman at iCloud.com
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to Send this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes the oil slick slick sheet 48 by 16
PTFE Roll that's 122 centimeters by 41
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our IP to Peter McWilliams another drug
warrior drug war warrior who was taken out
[SPEAKER_00]: before his time It's sad when when the
drug war got so bad that they were even
[SPEAKER_00]: just taking out, you know sick people it's
it's you got to shake your head really,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Let's raise our bongs for mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter on this beautiful Monday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get myself A little dab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go in for the terp dip Because I
can and I should of course All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the pump sometimes does that you
know, you just sometimes the pump does
[SPEAKER_00]: that All right, Kovella sour diesel it is
We are in the future Yeah, it's all lagged
[SPEAKER_00]: out today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to hear you guys tell me how
lagged out it is makes me feel good about
[SPEAKER_00]: the About the chat and about the whole
wake and bake episode really makes me want
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue on I I was stupid to pick this
this spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beside my house probably if I just
jumped off the internet connection it
[SPEAKER_00]: would have been much better, but Apologies
guys not the smartest move from the bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: man today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just gonna have a quick rip Maybe
we'll call it a nice quick five-minute
[SPEAKER_00]: wake and bake session.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't all have to be 45 minutes All
right, oh I know Jeff it's just the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation so It becomes kind of like
why bother kind of becomes like maybe I
[SPEAKER_00]: should have just like take a quick rip and
end this I always try to just I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: a responsibility every day But it's
getting to the point where you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a five ten minute one is worth it
when it's just not I mean my phone is
[SPEAKER_00]: flashing very bad connection very bad
connection, but unfortunately I have so
[SPEAKER_00]: much stuff here that it would be
impossible for me to move everything and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll just have to push through get a
couple of bong rips out of the way if
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and Yeah, yeah good stuff John
great, you know, here's the bottom line
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a really bad connection or a
good connection Suck it up and deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no really reason to make the whole
chat about how bad or good the connection
[SPEAKER_00]: is Let's just talk about something I'm
here for maybe five more minutes If you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys have questions if you guys want to
get into some hashish talk if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bowl
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying let's let's not
worry too much about the the lag on the
[SPEAKER_00]: connection otherwise It kind of hijacks
the conversation and then all we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about is the connection Can you
kind of see the value of like we could be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sifting bong ripping bubble hash
making curing sieving microplaning Proper
[SPEAKER_00]: curing of the plant material to gear it up
and get ready for hash making So much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Vinnie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what the whining really just It
hijacks the conversation and it changes
[SPEAKER_00]: the vibe as you can tell I'm slightly
annoyed
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad that it's working out now That's
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were patient and it went away and now
we have a decent connection So let's have
[SPEAKER_00]: are you a certified legend?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm definitely not a legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the king.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the prince I'm not anything that's
anywhere above anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit at the same level ground level With
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a humble servant of job Well,
I would offer you some advice If you're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking a question say in a chat room with
200 people Put the person's name in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of the question then and then they'll know
Who you're asking the question to I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Assume all the questions are asked it
being asked to me as I'm just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer them But if it's not for me just
put the other person's name in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hammer it out pretty good How long do
you dry the herb to make hash well it
[SPEAKER_00]: really depends on which herb you're
talking about Did I forget my Of course I
[SPEAKER_00]: did of course I did I Don't know what Alex
QC is on Instagram, but I'm sure we could
[SPEAKER_00]: get him to answer us easy enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you there Alex?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you there my brother if everyone wants
to actually?
[SPEAKER_00]: Share their Instagram feel free to if you
guys want to get each other following each
[SPEAKER_00]: other on Instagram Now might be a good
time for everyone to put up their
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram name might be a good way for you
guys to connect on Instagram and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: on BC bubble man and Mafioso no,
I'm definitely not a mafioso Interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: question though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, throw up your Instagrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to clean my bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to get my q-tips there so I could
clean out The chas not that there's any
[SPEAKER_00]: chas right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually pretty clean It's actually
pretty clean X double XL is definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: Serious bowl to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that's never happened
before I ended up getting Resin all over
[SPEAKER_00]: my finger cleaning that She was a dirty
one All right, so what's everyone up to on
[SPEAKER_00]: this beautiful Monday afternoon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Vitor is taking off on us peace out
Vitor any tips on your bubble doesn't full
[SPEAKER_00]: melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I love this question doesn't full melt
and kind of gets black and burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Cuban chronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a great Hint for you grow better
weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be mean But for real
dude if your shits burning black and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not melting I mean the bags are the word
of God They're basically telling you that
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've grown or what whoever's grown
that you've accessed is no bueno No,
[SPEAKER_00]: bueno.
[SPEAKER_00]: No bueno.
[SPEAKER_00]: No bueno.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people ask that question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how do I get mine my bubble to melt?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not melting and the answer obviously
it sounds terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody is excited to hear well You have to
grow better weed But it's a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: message to learn from the bags when you
put something in that you think is great
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't come out great the bags are
the word of God the bags are the pump You
[SPEAKER_00]: are wrong and the bags are right so how
you got that bubble to burn black is
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible because often the food the
salts do not really transfer into the
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichome head the things that
would make the The ash black on herb for
[SPEAKER_00]: instance are salts in the plant matter
that don't really contaminate the
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular head meaning I have taken
glandular heads from organic material that
[SPEAKER_00]: was grown outside but was never properly
flushed and so the material burned very
[SPEAKER_00]: dark and I ended up taking That same sweet
skunk and turning it into hash and the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift in the wet wash was really nice It's
smoked smooth, so I don't know if the
[SPEAKER_00]: person that you got that material from was
spraying chemicals on it to make it burn
[SPEAKER_00]: black like that but Definitely that
doesn't sound good, and if it's not malty
[SPEAKER_00]: if your bubble doesn't stick together If
it's not if it's just like sand that falls
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's low quality It's you've grown what I
like to call tootsie pops Which are you
[SPEAKER_00]: know those little?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lollipops that are a thick candy coating
and then a tiny little bit of the goodness
[SPEAKER_00]: in the inside We don't want tootsie pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want water balloons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want water balloons that are blown up
so big They're about to burst because the
[SPEAKER_00]: balloon itself is as thin as it could
possibly get And on the inside the water
[SPEAKER_00]: that would represent the cannabinoids and
the terpenes and the the profiles that we
[SPEAKER_00]: seek so Most people are focused on
vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are focused on vegetative yields How
much can I get and how fast can I get it
[SPEAKER_00]: and unfortunately because of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin tends to pay the price the
integrity of the quality It pays the price
[SPEAKER_00]: you can still take it and purify it to
99.9 percent heads, but if the resin heads
[SPEAKER_00]: are tootsie pops instead of Water balloons
you can see and trust me most people are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the tootsie pops I'm telling you
and it's just like thick wax heads With a
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny little bit of oil on the inside and
that wax tends to burn a little darker It
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't melt the same way as the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the pizza box and That's
that's my metaphor for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one more bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are having before we head off All right
does anyone Regulate the thickness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: wax head during growth does anything
regulate the thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes luster burn I suggest that it's
regulated by the ability of the grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics of the plant to Express
itself perfectly so it needs to express
[SPEAKER_00]: its terpene and cannabinoid profile to
Perfection and in order to do that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: variables have to line up I've had many
companies tell me for instance Ramos
[SPEAKER_00]: company talking about nutrients and
getting the plant what it needs to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Into this massive structure and I I said
listen if you really want to focus on a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient company if you understand the
science that phenols phenols and terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbons and alcohols are the building
blocks for all of the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles inside the glandular head
then why don't we try to come up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: food that can somehow manipulate or
increase those levels of Production in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant because if we can produce more
building blocks more hydrocarbons and
[SPEAKER_00]: phenols terpenes and phenol alcohols That
pump up into the upper membrane of the
[SPEAKER_00]: head the fibrous mat that cooks those
cannabinoids into being if we can Raise
[SPEAKER_00]: those levels to me that is a point of
interest much more than trying to raise
[SPEAKER_00]: the levels of growing You know all the
troll hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do we have to get rid of you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tell me what's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get rid of this motherfucker Let's
fee sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to tell who's the spammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Sophie you're the spammer Okay,
we'll just block you real quick there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey if you want to find me oh Man people
must be must be bored I picture that as
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 53 year old overweight balding man
in his mom's basement sending out those
[SPEAKER_00]: links the troll King Too bad the troll
King met the troll hammer today and did
[SPEAKER_00]: not stand a chance Sorry, Monica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You as well are gone It's quick also going
off on the spam train.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey the next time I see one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pay attention now I'm on the spam
hunt, so we'll make sure if we see any
[SPEAKER_00]: more that it's kind of funny though like
that people are coming on here and and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that Did you hear about the
biochemist who implanted THC developing
[SPEAKER_00]: genes into citrus fruit and able to grow
oranges with THC doesn't surprise me
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely heard about Yeast was another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah Thank you Celesteel Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it I've been a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for that For being such a human and
fallible But that's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there's Betty looks like Betty is
also looking to get blocked out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodbye Betty.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right No more that It is the internet
Well, yes and no it depends on what kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of trichomes there is a quality difference
There's a profile difference in different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of trichome heads now You know,
there are articles that will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: there's six different types of trichome
heads But really what they're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about is systolic hairs and other really
what I call non glandular Components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really there are three trichomes That
we're looking for and really only two that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for now from a medicinal
standpoint Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always not leave the other ones
behind the bulbous heads the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: less Appropriate it for the smoker the
connoisseur but that have great relief for
[SPEAKER_00]: people with different ailments Crohn's and
cancers and pain related diseases there
[SPEAKER_00]: are you know different cannabinoid
profiles in the bulbous heads as from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cecil and the capitate stocked and So,
you know the smoker generally looks for
[SPEAKER_00]: Something along the lines of a Cecil or a
capitate stock and the bulbous are these
[SPEAKER_00]: little ones that are stuck to the leaf and
these ones are the ones that beef up the
[SPEAKER_00]: oil returns and Make it seem like bubble
returns are small
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know about that Natural pine
bug spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Ramo was using the turpinator
And thinking that it was producing a much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher, you know, those things need to be
grown in very very environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled Rooms where you have scientists
kind of writing down all the information
[SPEAKER_00]: Really keeping track of things and the
reason I say scientists is because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna need some Gas chromatograph some
HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna need to do some work where
you test these materials before during and
[SPEAKER_00]: after I'm just not into taking anyone's
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a company got in touch with me
recently soil I Don't want to mix up their
[SPEAKER_00]: name, but the soil company got in touch
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're producing living soils beneficial
microbes the whole nine yards probiotics
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have a claim That they're also
raising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry Clara Olsen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just saw you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me block you real quick you twat They
just mentioned that they were going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing a product I don't know if it's
in the soil, but that basically can
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate terpene levels and raise
terpene levels So once again, I never
[SPEAKER_00]: really really trust Yeah, I knew you guys
would get a hold of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I get a kick out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of the class clown I'll often say
little things for a laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a punchline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Like a comedian, so please don't ever
get offended with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes you guys send me emails like
that I've embarrassed you in chat There's
[SPEAKER_00]: no embarrassing anyone in chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're all great I'm not trying to
embarrass anyone and don't be worried
[SPEAKER_00]: about being like shown to be wrong or
something Don't let your ego and your
[SPEAKER_00]: insecurities Attack you from your inner
self.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to be wrong It's how I learned
almost everything that I know today And
[SPEAKER_00]: that means I had to be wrong a lot of the
time to cut to get this kind of knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: stacked up Particularly in regards to
cannabis knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to be wrong a lot to get to the
level that I'm at now people ask me How do
[SPEAKER_00]: you take such great photos?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, you're only seeing the
great photo and not the 10,000 shitty ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that I took before the great photo so
valuable mistakes instead of costly or
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry valuable lessons instead of costly
mistakes The boats getting picked up
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to get the boat tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, it's Anne pussy I'm gonna have to
get rid of her too, even though she just
[SPEAKER_00]: put up hard I have a feeling she's gonna
pull some spam action on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't be having that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting some serious sex spam going
on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I got her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God for digital photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, there's another one Dora Olson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing amazing amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta go guys Thanks for watching
everybody send me that email at BC bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: man at iCloud comm and may the full melt
bless your bowl Sooner than later
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace You You
