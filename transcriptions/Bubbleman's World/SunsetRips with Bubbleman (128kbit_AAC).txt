[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just figured I'd come smoke a bowl with
some of my online YouTube followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the Instagram and Facebook people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always happy to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of questions coming in all the
time, so I'm trying to answer them and get
[SPEAKER_01]: videos done in regards to particular
questions that you guys asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today, today's video is just about
enjoying the beautiful sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured we'd load up the mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of you probably recognize the view.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken quite a few pictures of this
particular pipe here with that view in the
[SPEAKER_01]: background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, instead of taking a picture,
I thought, let's make a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made some really exceptional bubble
the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just loading that video up right now with
John.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the fresh frozen whole plant
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that video coming up real soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, have a nice sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never ever see no tomorrow.
