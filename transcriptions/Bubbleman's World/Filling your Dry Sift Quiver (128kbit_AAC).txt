[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to bubble man's world and welcome
to Filling up your dry sift quiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the title of the video today that
we're doing and what I've got here is I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a whole variety of a different Sizes
and and actual screen sizes both obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that these are a much
different size screen in just their actual
[SPEAKER_00]: size But also the holes themselves are
different as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to get into talking a little
bit about that I've got three things that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cover today I'm going to
cover the simple trick that everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: been talking about Two screens are used a
250 micron as well as a 180 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's these two right here So these are
my medium sized screens and they come in a
[SPEAKER_00]: two and a four screen set So I'm not sure
if you noticed when I lifted up the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've cut my screen in half here so you
can see that with the fresh Eddie screens
[SPEAKER_00]: because we put them on Properly that even
a rip from one piece of the metal to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next I can still use this screen and I'm
going to show you how Of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will eventually replace it as using the
best possible tools is always the best
[SPEAKER_00]: possible idea But I'm just showing you
that you can actually Use these screens
[SPEAKER_00]: even once they've been potentially
damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the first way we're going to do
today Mentioned the three methods I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do that right over there actually
So I've got a little bit of nugget in this
[SPEAKER_00]: screen here I'm gonna change the camera
angle for you guys bring it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: closer so you can see what's going on here
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I have here is a tiny little bit
of bud that I broke up Over top of this
[SPEAKER_00]: screen and to show you this process really
to show you how absolutely delicate it is
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just a matter of dropping the
herb That's probably more than I needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: do right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we lift up our first screen and
you can see on it Right here you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's captured some contaminant so if
I move in for you there you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: that is contaminant it's sitting on top of
the screen and It's very delicate this
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this contaminant can fall So easily
so what we really need to do is we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: lift up the screen like this Both of them
at a time and I'm sorry that I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: this on the all white part of this Screen,
but we can just do this So that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: sift wizard technique Won't usually give
him much of a shout out because I find
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a little bit negative So this is
what you would call a very high percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of heads possibly upwards of 80 to 90
percent And that's because I've already
[SPEAKER_00]: run this material once so it's it's sort
of at the end knocking over the parchment
[SPEAKER_00]: and so another thing you can do with this
process is you can you can kind of Gently
[SPEAKER_00]: mix the herb across the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to release a lot of
contaminants, but What you can do with
[SPEAKER_00]: this method is once you've collected your
your your higher grade You can produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary grade that is going to be much
more contaminated I can see already that
[SPEAKER_00]: the color is is much darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was only a About seven grams of
cannabis total that I broke up here I just
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to kind of give you guys an idea of
how the sift Trick works and so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: also give this a little shiggy shiggy What
we get here is gentle gentle contaminant
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting on top of this screen and It's
best to just keep those off to the side
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we can take this sift Now this
trick can be used over and over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again, and it doesn't just need to be used
with herb You can actually use this trick
[SPEAKER_00]: with sift as well, and I'll show you how
we can do that real quick Let's get this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy out Put the herb on the screen here
Okay, give it a quick rinse Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Now another way you can use this trick
is I've got my I guess my colander.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 250 micron screen I use it
mostly just to get the hash Evenly to fall
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's not in clumps as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit of the barb It's
clumped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can drop it in here gently I'm not
going to use a ton because I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you the process and I can gently Rub
this over the screen Break these little
[SPEAKER_00]: balls down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use my finger to to break these
balls down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't they're not that tough a little
bit tough Tougher than Then the brush will
[SPEAKER_00]: allow but once you've got these components
broken into smaller little pieces where
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll actually run through the screen
and it's just a matter of rinsing and
[SPEAKER_00]: washing with the brush over and over again
to push this stuff through and what you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: often be found with at the end is you'll
end up with a tiny little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant so as well as a couple of
balls that just don't want to break so
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you that little show right there So
this is a lower grade right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's completely covered in systolic hairs
and capitate stocks So just from that
[SPEAKER_00]: without doing anything else without
banging or touching anything too harsh We
[SPEAKER_00]: can see that barely anything fell through
so we're going to give it a gentle card
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a gentle card to get some of this
resin to come through this is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different than the herb process But what
this will do is it'll drop these resin
[SPEAKER_00]: heads and these contaminants through and
You can see now on my secondary screen
[SPEAKER_00]: That I have all of this contaminant
sitting right here on top of the screen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the naked eye it may not look like
contaminant, but when I get my Acro lens
[SPEAKER_00]: out and I show you what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will see it as clear as a day All
right, so Gather up a little bit more And
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is from the barb get that one over
there because it was a little different So
[SPEAKER_00]: here they have some pure heads from the
barb now you can see that the process is
[SPEAKER_00]: really giving us a small amount each time
and So that's why today I wanted to go
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a multitude of process All right,
so back to the distance shot here I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to show you with the two screens what I've
done here, which is a fairly important
[SPEAKER_00]: component It's on the bottom side of this
screen what I've added is I've added four
[SPEAKER_00]: Little spacers, and I've glued them to the
bottom of the corners now these spacers
[SPEAKER_00]: came from one of my Pelican cases It's
simply the foam that was inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pelican case I pulled out two little
strips for each corner cut them about two
[SPEAKER_00]: inches long and I glued them to the bottom
of the screen so the top screen sits like
[SPEAKER_00]: a dish right, but the bottom screen Sits
upside down so the screen is flush to the
[SPEAKER_00]: frame So you get the two like this Okay,
and this process is great for having at
[SPEAKER_00]: your office next to you on your desk
Having it set up in your home somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: always so it's just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a nice Sheet of plexiglass or
glass or whatever you have cut To fit your
[SPEAKER_00]: screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this little piece of white paper
because I'm constantly moving them around
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems to be easiest for me very easy to
brush off as well and One of the things I
[SPEAKER_00]: should mention that the reason this is all
going to work today Is because it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: cold outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely cold outside right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be close to below zero Which is
why dry sifting a with the properly dried
[SPEAKER_00]: material and B in the proper setting with
the proper variables ie it being cold and
[SPEAKER_00]: dry We don't want a lot of humidity in the
air We want it to be cold and dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what it is right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt about it so I guess I guess we
could card a little bit of more of this
[SPEAKER_00]: gently through Not even carding it because
the hole is so big I can actually just use
[SPEAKER_00]: the brush and so gently gently gently
That's going to produce an enormous amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of contaminant But a small small amount of
the goods I just don't have enough room
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go It's always good to set everything
up, so you have room Okay get three nice
[SPEAKER_00]: little piles here Now keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've used a very small amount We use
about seven grams of bud to get these two
[SPEAKER_00]: little piles which I've already gotten all
the good stuff from that bud unfortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't able to show you the fresh bud
being crushed up and Then being used,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I kind of want to show you guys you
don't have to have bud you can use older
[SPEAKER_00]: material That's trim or our larf bud
that's been crushed up you can of course
[SPEAKER_00]: use beautiful top quality bud which I urge
you to do and Of course you can use sift
[SPEAKER_00]: as well like you saw us do with this and
you could run it over and over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again through these screens Throwing it
down gently lifting up the two screens
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting the small amount of what's
there and just putting it onto the side
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one Method and I urge you to have
it in your hash quiver This is a 60 lines
[SPEAKER_00]: per inch as well as a 90 lines per inch
which is 250 micron for the 60 and 180
[SPEAKER_00]: micron for the 90 the numbers are
counterintuitive And don't match up as you
[SPEAKER_00]: might have noticed lines per inch is a
much smaller number to equal a much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: micron number So I guess what we're going
to do is that's enough with that process
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shown you pretty clearly what you can
do with that If you need be So Now I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk a little bit about the other
two screens now the other two screens Are
[SPEAKER_00]: the 110 lines per inch and the 200 lines
per inch This is a 110 right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what I would do with these is pretty
much the same thing you don't need the The
[SPEAKER_00]: spacers, but you can put them on as well
and what I do is I have the Top-one right
[SPEAKER_00]: side like this so it's like a dish that my
material can fit in whether I'm cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: sift Whether I'm cleaning cannabis bud or
or dry sit or trim Regardless of what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always have this one upright like a dish
We're not going to be using that because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already acquired the secondary
material that I want to use so We're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get right into carding and so a lot of you
know the process of carding It's simply
[SPEAKER_00]: put we can take a little bit of resin Get
it into into here Always the bumps want to
[SPEAKER_00]: fall out first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Just the way it's going to be Oops
Get rid of that stuff There we go And I
[SPEAKER_00]: would also suggest that you get a couple
of brushes I clean mine all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's nice to have one brush That you
can use for plant matter and another brush
[SPEAKER_00]: or two that you can use to scoop up your
resins even when you're dealing with The
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned resin that you've already cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to have a separate brush for the
contaminant as opposed to for the the pure
[SPEAKER_00]: heads So take this Run it through the
colander real quick Right And this just
[SPEAKER_00]: gets it even this is just like Taking your
flour and milling it we do this because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to remove a tiny bit of
contaminant Which I will show you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner here again Yeah, that's just nasty
nasty nasty Right and then carding so
[SPEAKER_00]: Standard carding that I've been showing
for quite a few years now, which is just
[SPEAKER_00]: to take the resin and gently Card it back
and forth on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what this is doing is a multitude
of things It's going to push the resin
[SPEAKER_00]: that is non-resin ie the contaminant the
plant matter contaminant which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: Capricate stocks and systolic hairs and a
variety of things that are indeed Appear
[SPEAKER_00]: to be glandular to the naked eye and have
a very golden color And you'll notice I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: able to card this fairly fast well That's
because I'm working in a very cold
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and I can feel that it's it's
a slow process I can feel that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of contaminants and very few heads But
this process what it'll do is it'll push
[SPEAKER_00]: those capitate stocks those systolic hairs
and any of those other non glandular
[SPEAKER_00]: components It'll push them through the 70
micron 110 lines per inch screen and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll end up doing This is a this is a
process that definitely takes time What
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll end up doing eventually is pushing
so much through that the percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: heads that you have on the top starts to
Really unveil the quality that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: once you can acquire that purity you'll
really start to unveil the the quality so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to show you this for an hour
But this is a very slow process the
[SPEAKER_00]: carding process and the next tip that
we're going to show you is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: carding process improved and so To see if
even that worked to the same Slightest see
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, yep herbs that fell through Just
to show you just from a small amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: carding a very small amount of carding
this this was clean before I even started
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see That I've cleaned Probably
close to a half a gram to a gram of
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant so that is the contaminant
that I pushed through on the screen and
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's I'll photograph it for you guys
I'm guaranteeing it's going to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous amount of systolic hairs and
capitate stocks and some heads that are
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than 70 micron so That's the
carding process you've seen I hope that
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys aren't going to be disappointed
that I'm not spending 20 minutes on each
[SPEAKER_00]: process These are really simple and what I
really want to inspire in you is questions
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have questions about this
particular video, I will make a second
[SPEAKER_00]: video and I'll of each process
specifically to Reply to your questions
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have because maybe I forgot
things I know I went over the two screen
[SPEAKER_00]: trick really quick And I'll explain you
one of the things that's happening in that
[SPEAKER_00]: two screen trick is you have these two
Micron screens very close together with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little space in the middle But you're
using screens that are much larger than we
[SPEAKER_00]: normally use when it comes to dry sifting
And that's where the trick comes in when
[SPEAKER_00]: you drop the material onto the screen The
heads are going to fall like rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go straight down like
this the contaminant is going to fall more
[SPEAKER_00]: like feathers and what they happen to do
is they stick into the secondary screen
[SPEAKER_00]: even though the hole is very big and under
normal situations if you were thrashing or
[SPEAKER_00]: tumbling Everything would go straight
through in this situation The contaminant
[SPEAKER_00]: is falling like a feather and then getting
stuck in the bottom of the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: screen So that is why that process works
this process works because The screens are
[SPEAKER_00]: so tight on the secondary screen the 70
micron if you can imagine The carding is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to break up the non glandular
material and that's why the cold is
[SPEAKER_00]: important And that's why dry is important
any moisture any heat any humidity are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work against you in this process
So you really want to make sure you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: cold environment and really really dry
material and then you'll see things like
[SPEAKER_00]: carding really have an effect because
you're running this material over a screen
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth and on a microscopic level
what's happening is the Small contaminant
[SPEAKER_00]: the systolic hairs and the capitate stocks
over time are breaking up and
[SPEAKER_00]: disintegrating into smaller parts much
like the way the ocean will break down You
[SPEAKER_00]: know large rocks into smaller pieces and
eventually into sand So what we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do now for our third process,
and this is the newest trick that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: come across Via online and through my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a gentleman do this some months ago
now when he was taking a DVD cover I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have a Wii game Scribble knots
one of my kids games and he was using
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment paper, so we will pull out a
little parchment paper We will wrap this
[SPEAKER_00]: movie, and I guess what he was doing what
I really like Because I played around with
[SPEAKER_00]: the static a little bit myself,
but one of the things I really liked about
[SPEAKER_00]: this Was that there's gonna be anything to
rip this with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there is Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: so This parchment paper now I guess this
works on a principle of like static But
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also working really on the principle
of what I'm seeing is it's extending the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the card that we're using to push
through contaminants and So that's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that I was really interested
about I've only tried this process a few
[SPEAKER_00]: times D4 20k was really excited about it
the last time I talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that it helped him Clean up his
carding game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know tenfold, so I thought you know
what I've got the audience It's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: very important for me to share this
because I want everyone to share to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: up their game a tenfold I don't want
people to be carding for 20 hours if they
[SPEAKER_00]: can be carding for a short period of time,
so We wrap the DVD in parchment And then
[SPEAKER_00]: we push it through and you can see right
off the bat there's some heads that stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: to it Right off the bat a little bit of
pure headies here
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely a very cool process The fact
that there's a little bit of head sticking
[SPEAKER_00]: to the parchment each time and it's a very
pure pure pure form of heads I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is something that people can really
learn to use as an advantage to their dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sifting method We're getting that tiny
little bit of pure heads stuck right to
[SPEAKER_00]: the edge of the parchment paper And I have
to say I like it So this is one more way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we have a quiver, and this is
why we got to stop Fighting with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another about what the best process is
when we really what we should really do
[SPEAKER_00]: What we should be doing is we should be
discussing with one another How we can
[SPEAKER_00]: move this forward and I'm definitely
liking this large sort of movie theater
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of Parchment paper movie DVD game
whatever you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too shabby at all you can see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice little pile right here,
which is much faster than the two screen
[SPEAKER_00]: method probably This taped probably next
time All right So we're just working it
[SPEAKER_00]: working it working it and you can see that
what we're doing is we're not only picking
[SPEAKER_00]: up But more importantly what we're doing
is we're pushing through We're pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: through the contaminant, and you can see
that the material that has been left on
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular screen here is Of a lower
quality than when we started and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see straight up That what I've done is
I've removed a much lighter Head from the
[SPEAKER_00]: darker heads so what I'm going to do right
now is I'm going to get my macro lens out
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to photograph the varieties
that I did with the dry sift tech with the
[SPEAKER_00]: two screens the 60 and the 90 lpi Then I
will show you a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant that I pushed through with the
carding technique And then we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: move right into macro photographs of this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to show you what I
carded what I took off the parchment paper
[SPEAKER_00]: and even what was under the Screen of the
70 microns, so I hope you guys have
[SPEAKER_00]: learned something in this quick little
tutorial I know that the real thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: will open up our minds is the macro
photographs, so I'm going to go do that
[SPEAKER_00]: right away I'm going to take a dab of that
go do the macro photographs, and I'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: back to you guys with a little sort of
finish up Discussing what we've done here
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I've been playing around and I
took a few macro shots I just want to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the DVD right here's the three times
from the DVD I got in the middle three
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds from Carding on the three
piles on the white The Kinect sign are
[SPEAKER_00]: from the two screen trick the 60 and the
90 lp and then I added these three on the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner here, which is a different kind of
hat That I did the DVD trick to so we got
[SPEAKER_00]: these over here, and you can see probably
out of everything I'd have to say the
[SPEAKER_00]: nicest material was this it was a I think
it was a chemo material that I had chemo
[SPEAKER_00]: hash plant It turned out really nice that
you can really see how it pulled out an
[SPEAKER_00]: almost red like head Compared to the
contaminant which is very green and
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery also in the middle here You've got
a very green contaminant that came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: these two much lighter Components and you
see it as well on the DVD So what I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do I'll give you guys a little
bit of a better show here rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: holding it up at a weird angle So we'll
show you our DVD kinds boom boom boom so
[SPEAKER_00]: this was What what did we have here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this was our best This was our
second best and this was our swag and so
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got it as well here We've got the
best second best swag and then we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: best Second best swag and then these three
I have a hard time figuring out because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go closer to them You can kind of see
a golden material Underneath like it got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little hard it got worked so this resin
could be potentially cleaned as well So
[SPEAKER_00]: there you have it all the different
processes right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can show you what a raw sift looks like
as well on there Just to give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: color effect Quite dark a little bit green
not the cleanest of sift you can see When
[SPEAKER_00]: I go into sift like this how you could see
this come out of it this one right here is
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely what has happened from Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Overspinning his material which is no
problem because with the ability of
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning it you can't really ever Overspin
it from a hash making perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we like gentler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely the way we want to go But
if you want to make sure you get every
[SPEAKER_00]: last little bit of that resin off of your
plants I totally understand It and I
[SPEAKER_00]: support it so I will be putting in the
macro photographs both Throughout as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: taking as I'm talking about the resins
I'll show them right at that point But
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also put a little slideshow in at the
end of the video So you can see all the
[SPEAKER_00]: macro photographs that we got so thank you
for watching bubble man's world I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that you guys learned something from Phil
about filling your dry sift quiver if you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys have any tips or tricks that you've
acquired on your own and you want to share
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the comments please do so that
would be wonderful and If you guys have
[SPEAKER_00]: any questions in regards to things that
I've shown here today that wasn't clear or
[SPEAKER_00]: that you didn't quite catch on Please ask
the question I will make a point of
