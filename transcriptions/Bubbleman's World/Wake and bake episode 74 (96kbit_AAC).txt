[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it worked!
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Canada, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Wake and Bake episode 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to be giving away one of my good
buddy Dana Larson's books today,
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Buds and Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fucking awesome little book.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first saw it, it threw me off a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of like, whoa, he's doing these
kids books, but he's making a cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I wasn't, I was a little like,
oh, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I read the book and I learned
more about what Dana was doing with Harry
[SPEAKER_00]: Pothead and with Green Buds, and Hash,
and a few other different books,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really saw that the parody was really
educational and there was a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: information that he was passing on that
would be good for parents to read to their
[SPEAKER_00]: kids, particularly if maybe they're using
cannabis as a medicine and they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of break into the ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The book I wanted to give away today was a
copy of Cannabis in Canada, another book
[SPEAKER_00]: by Dana Larson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had wonderful artwork done throughout
the whole book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself have a page in there with my
Manitoba hemp guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this is a Dana Larson parody,
Green Buds and Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just to give you a little,
you know, this guy's trying to get him to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a puff, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like them in a joint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I won't read the whole book to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some pretty funny things in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The video that we're going to be getting
the question and the answer from,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, is going to be called Dana Larson,
Green Buds and Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a video with him all back in May
of 2015, just on his couch in his living
[SPEAKER_00]: room there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first 20 minutes, it's between 15
and 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some cream on his desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to know the name of the cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to know which category it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to give me the name and
then you're going to give me the category
[SPEAKER_00]: of that cream and you will win.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check out that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Dana Larson, Green Buds and
Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, Daniel, you gave half the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave half the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone want to finish Daniel's answer
off with the whole thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know the name of the,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Bud Rich with half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bud Rich has had half of the answer and
Daniel had half of the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm looking for are their two answers
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone wants to, that's kind of the
easiest way I can give it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, MJ cream, calm, lavender,
chamomile, MJ cream, calm, chasey Figgins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you seem to be the first one to
actually put the two answers together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so chasey Figgins, you have a nice new
book coming to you, uh, from Dana
[SPEAKER_00]: Larson's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want, I will get Dana Larson to
sign it like he did for me to bubble man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: For green buds and hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chase, you win the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you get much enjoyment out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, Hey Anthony, if there's no point
on trying, then fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, shit, don't even write that you're
not going to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not even any point in writing that
you're not going to try because nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I personally don't anyway,
but I do care that chasey Figgins tried
[SPEAKER_00]: and that he won the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always excited for people when they
win the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie, but I'm more
excited, uh, to be able to bake my wake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my email again?
[SPEAKER_00]: BC bubble man at iCloud.com is the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for reminding me chasey
Figgins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to give it out every time fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but clearly I spaced it this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's have a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a little, little dab,
dab, dab a roo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never win.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't try, you know, Peter asked,
that is so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Benny sheets with the half answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit late morning there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian Steve chilling like a villain is in
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: DK trades, Alan Mota, Bud Rich,
Norwegian frog, Tara Lee, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, John Kiyote wakey bakey vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am down with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit a little bit of,
uh, this Congo last tiny little piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually pretty excited to rip it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a long day ahead of us on,
uh, we're going to go out on the boat
[SPEAKER_00]: today, do some wake skating and some wake
boarding and some wake surfing,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the wake funds, obviously,
and, uh, some Canada day, uh, experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure what exactly will happen,
but it should be fun tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a pretty good show popping
together for hash church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still trying to get Alec from,
um, from se labs and going to be getting
[SPEAKER_00]: this gentleman Peter from soil balance pro
come and talk to us about different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains of probiotics of, uh, of
bacterias, beneficial bacterias that can
[SPEAKER_00]: help cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Express itself to a higher degrees of what
it would other was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of wake skates slip,
but I'd honestly, like I bought so many of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things, I'd have to literally look
at the name of it because I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a really, really new one recently
that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: My old one's pretty much just a board,
uh, you know, with a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: rubber on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new one has like a super thick
coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go on there and bare feet and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrofoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't have any hydrofoil on order
just yet, but here, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the bake on guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the Klein 7.7 sub eight cleaned up for
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we're going to dip into the D
nail sapphire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting peeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sent out your package the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure the release of Chris
Bennett's new book, but I could have them
[SPEAKER_00]: come out on a wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe offer one up for a gift and come
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a few pages from green buds and
hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Canada day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like them in a bong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like them all day long?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would not in a bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would not all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not like green buds and hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want them Mr. Stache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like them wrapped in paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you try them now or later?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want them wrapped in paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want them now or later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want them in a bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want them all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not like green buds and hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want them Mr. Stache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good old Mr. Stache, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this goes on for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's talking about glaucoma and
MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like it in a tincture?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could show you how to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I offer buds and hash for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no benefit for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone said that you were sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green buds and hash might do the trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spoiler alert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, do you find you're getting thinner
with no appetite for dinner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you suffer from sclerosis, epilepsy,
or neurosis?
[SPEAKER_00]: For almost all the ills that ail you,
buds and hash will never fail you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How have glaucoma, PMS, green buds and
hash have much success?
[SPEAKER_00]: For protection against strokes,
it's best to have some potent hopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your muscles are not dandy,
try some green bud infused candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For migraines, spasms, even cancer,
green buds and hash provide the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not feeling right, then have
green buds and hash tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not feeling great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My house been rather poor of late.
[SPEAKER_00]: My doctor says that I have ills.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me I should take these pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot even sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never do feel quite all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't listen to that doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll fuck you all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try green buds and hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try them, Mr. Stache.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're getting through to this
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: His first puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: His first puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look how happy he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that guy right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, now, I am feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work just like you said they would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never felt this fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green buds and hash are quite divine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will bake a green bud brownie whenever I
am feeling frowny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try them vaporized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That technique seems very wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take them in a tincture and in
every other mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: He learned the secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps I would prefer to puff and stop
when I have had enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will roll some juicy joints and smoke
them down to little points.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will toke upon the bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do it all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like green buds and hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do enjoy them, Mr. Stache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being so insistent and for
being so persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mind and body are improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: My spirit also has been moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though I was told they are a sin,
green buds and hash are medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry that I was so hateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know I should be grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. Stache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for green buds and hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dana Larson, for putting stuff
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a cool little book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is a real fun little
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't read the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was quite a bit of him kind of
trying to turn the dude on and get him to
[SPEAKER_00]: try some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you know, it's a classic story
really done in a parody of a Dr. Seuss,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we all know the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have our grandparents and some of
us have our parents that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one thing to have a negative
against cannabinoids and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel people that use them are negative and
have this sort of prejudice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is towards it, but it's another to cut
yourself off from the actual benefits that
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be giving you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that book is a real neat
little way to educate through the parody
[SPEAKER_00]: of Dr. Seuss, which we all love Dr. Seuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my goodness, couldn't have picked
a better one, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we should have one more little
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grinch grin when the rosin press has
squeezed out its last drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dana Larson is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a mad shout out to Dana
Larson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has done so much good for the cannabis
scene here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really from the beginning days when I
first met him, Dana was the editor for
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Culture magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long time ago, like over 20
years, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's done a lot since, you know,
when Mark went to jail, Dana really picked
[SPEAKER_00]: up the slack.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started opening dispensaries,
teaching people how to open dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his MJ Cream company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was doing Sensible BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's running for the NDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like the guy is really busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think that all the work that he
does is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you couldn't really support a better
person in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put money towards Dana or his
companies, you know, the majority of it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes right back into the industry,
the community, you know, activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, yeah, he's got some great pot TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember him doing like a what was he
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like smoking DMT and smoking herb and then
driving his car.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got he got into a bit of trouble for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, let's have a quick dab here and
get a get another one done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could change one thing you have
done your cannabis travels, what would you
[SPEAKER_00]: change and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of people might say that they
would change getting busted at the
[SPEAKER_00]: roadblock with 16 pounds and six and a
half grand cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, that was an obstacle turned
into an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think bubble bags would have
ever been created had I not had that
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think I would change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that when you go back and you try
to change things in your life,
[SPEAKER_00]: inadvertently, you will change a lot more
than you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not really a big on regrets guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at a lot of my obstacles,
my mistakes, if you will, as obstacles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wouldn't regret any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, maybe my only regret is not
making more mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very my mistakes were very
successful for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'll say.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mistakes were very successful for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more mistakes for me, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fuck up rather well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of know-it-alls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could only find purple candy strain and
shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I feel your pain, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel your pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think mine is not trying cannabis before
age 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay, Tara Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You found it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your friend and it will be with you
throughout the rest of your life if you so
[SPEAKER_00]: choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, it'll always be there when you
choose to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beautiful thing about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that today on Canada Day,
they'll have the police out on the boats
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll be looking at all the boats
and they'll be coming around to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that is, is not because
people enjoy cannabis, but because people
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And alcohol is dangerous, particularly in
almost any situation, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can become dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out on a boat definitely can become
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like being out on a boat,
especially on the ocean, you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely don't want to turn your
back on the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what have we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Lillian Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just pull out my hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what she wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what she wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There she is.
There she is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't be a wake and bake without a bot
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I kind of feel like that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the ass bots.
[SPEAKER_00]: People die for drinking and boating near
the lake near me every summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, today they'll be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be in their militarized vests and
guns and radios and pepper sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be driving around searching
from boat to boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when they get to my boat,
they're not going to find any alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might see a bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might see some hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're definitely not going to be
seeing any alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see how it goes with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll end up having a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely going to be bringing my federal
license with me out on the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was the last time you ran out of
hash, bubble man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've ever run out of hash as
bubble man, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like an alien experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten low, but not running out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for instance, my, okay,
for instance, let me show you this little
[SPEAKER_00]: situation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a jar of about 10 or 15 grams of
full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another jar of about 10 or 15
grams of full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are used for my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my phone on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bounce my phone on these two jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that you guys didn't even know
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every day I do these wake and bake
videos, my phone is sitting on about 25
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because each time I kind of
want to smoke it and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, the phone's on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to really move it and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, I can open almost any
jar, any, any spot on my desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just, there's just stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's some Horatio's
distillates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, you know, there's some leftover dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff, this stuff is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've been through this already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stuck everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some 10 year old stuff stuck right
here next to my computer desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show the air con temp control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what that is that you're
requesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the floor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God, dude, the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The floors, the floors got some hash on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent about 20 minutes yesterday
cleaning my desk and it's the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I cleaned my desk down here and you
can barely see there's some of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the hard drives on the other side
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, cleaned her up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaned her up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrape, scrape, scrape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I had my desk in my office at
the melting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a homeless guy that used to
come and ask for any type of jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would of course, you know,
try to give him as many jobs as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that he would do is
tidy up the gallery and do the floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had like a mop and pail and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used to come in and when he was
around my desk, I came in one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like down with his hands and knees
and he's trying to use the soap and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some kind of, some kind of a resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like, there was probably
like seven to 10 grams of it around my
desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like an absurd amount for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Oh, try some alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him some isopropanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, Oh, it's coming off really
good now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just felt bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like a lot, a lot of hash
on the ground there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably could have like a trailer park,
but yeah, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even fucking joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that much because when he finally
scraped it all up, it might've even been
[SPEAKER_00]: more, it was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then it was the days of abundance
and youth and stupidity and lots of,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe more we're getting dropped than
needed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chased out your desk, AJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good floor hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they were hardwood floors in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was good, but I had a roller chair
and I'd end up rolling over all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually the wheels on the chair also
were pretty gummed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as impressive as skunk man Sam,
sealing a pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cleaning his bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it took him about 15 to 20 years,
but he sealed a pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when they came and they cut that pipe
out and they cut it open, it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: solid resin on the inside of like a pipe,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you know how tough you have to
puff to be able to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardwood floors are not a good desiccant
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, cat hairs, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be picking my cat out of my house if
it was doing that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mess around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shave that cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: One man gather what another man spills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I would have been like, Hey buddy,
scrape that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it with some alcohol, strain it
through a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, don't be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set your bar higher, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a weird kind of thing with
cannabis where we want to save every last
[SPEAKER_00]: bit and I feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always felt like the edible
industry really started by people trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to save what they were throwing away from
after extracting or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower quality materials, trims,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it turned into,
oh, let's just, you know, we'll make some
[SPEAKER_00]: butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make some product with the
leftovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the edible quality that they're
giving to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see the day where edibles
are made with the utmost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess there's a huge distillate
edible market now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good that they're taking high
quality cannabinoids or at least high
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage, maybe not quality,
hopefully purity when you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: monomolecular medicines, because generally
if you're not coming up pure, probably
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be some of the solvents that
are left over in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Vegas drop yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, high quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not make the best hash that you could
make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like take your 90 micron and make your
edibles with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a level of medicine that for
myself, that's what I would want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would want.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just get caught up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are my thoughts on making dry sip
with bubble bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what are my thoughts on making dry
sip with bubble bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are my thoughts on filming a movie on
a still camera or taking pictures with a
[SPEAKER_00]: video camera?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys notice when you take
pictures with a video camera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you notice that the pictures kind of
suck?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you notice when you make video with
a camera, even a beautiful camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 5D Mark III, beautiful camera,
they've filmed some Hollywood scenes of
[SPEAKER_00]: movies with that camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are limitations to it and
it's not properly designed for that job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, with the 5D Mark III,
it's fine if you want to set up the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera, set your focus and your lighting
and have a shot move through the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the camera itself has to move with
the shot and focus has to stay and
[SPEAKER_00]: interchange, then you're going to be
fucked and you would want to use a camera
[SPEAKER_00]: that was designed to film in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, the bubble bags were designed
to use water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying you can't make a sift with
bubble bags, but I'm saying they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: designed for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not ideal for that job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're taking it seriously,
it's not really a ton of cash to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sift screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make them yourself for probably a
hundred, maybe a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sell them for a couple hundred,
obviously minor, great quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: warrantied and come with the customer
service that is asking me a question about
[SPEAKER_00]: it at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the value differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to support fresh headies,
bubble bags, we got your screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can show you a couple of different ways
to make some really great dry sift screens
[SPEAKER_00]: that are designed specifically to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the best heating unit is going to be
the one that you like the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't ask someone else what
the best is because we all have different
[SPEAKER_00]: opinions and we all have different
abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you would, you know, if someone
who has a very low olfactory and very low
[SPEAKER_00]: taste compared to someone who has a high
olfactory and a high level of taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not going to be experiencing
things the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to experience much more of the
terpene profile that is present than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a level of enjoyment that
maybe the one doesn't even know exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've also got people that are so
sensitive that they notice the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between resin and terpenes evaporating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off of different heat sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So titanium versus sapphire glass versus
silicon carbide, ceramic, all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different compounds are going to disperse
the heat differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how we vaporize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you hit your torch, you torch up
your, your nail, whatever your nail is
[SPEAKER_00]: made of, and then you decide how long you
allow that temperature to leave that nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of these surface areas are
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really no real answer for that
in the sense that, that it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: different for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be different for each of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting because once you know
that you can grab these different surface
[SPEAKER_00]: areas and you can start doing some
experimenting and see if you can't notice
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really a perfect example is, you know,
with, with the count, with how people are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the, their, their, their, the horrible
distaste that is left in their mouth for
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking of wasting a cannabis product,
especially something that's been illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even through its legalities is still
expensive, like platinum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't want to waste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what people tend to do is they tend to
heat things too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hit things too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They chazz, they get this really hot hit,
but they feel that they got it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did get it all in a sense,
but you destroyed so much of the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile that you didn't really experience
the other side of that rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that hardcore like THC buzz,
but you didn't really experience the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the velvety smoothness of the bouquet,
the profile that is the underlining,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the language, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be getting into this
into Hash Church tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are the most widely ranged
language on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how, it's how we communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plants communicate to us and to one
another, smells, pheromones, all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things are languages that create
dialogue between different, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from people to animals to, to plants to,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have a really cool
conversation about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get in some great guys from
Soil Balance Pro to come in and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: their love of soil and probiotics and the
importance of these bacterias to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: these symbiotic relationships where the
plants can be pushed to express greater
[SPEAKER_00]: and further terpene and cannabinoid
expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be good for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, I feel like I should have
one more rip with you guys before we send
[SPEAKER_00]: you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been yammering a little bit,
but when I get on it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stay on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was something I wanted to share
with you guys in regards to, is there ever
[SPEAKER_00]: just a simple answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's taken me 20 years to learn this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have a big rip for the Aussies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the Aussies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash Church is going to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Blue River, a bubble man brand via
Chalice is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony said no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw the other day, he was like,
oh, maybe I will go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe he'll just roll through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more Hash Church dramas coming
out in the near future that you guys will
[SPEAKER_00]: hear about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice a little bit of change in
Hash Church over the course of the next
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's going to be exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Drama doesn't have to be a negative thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes drama is really exciting and
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so many people are focused that
drama is like this negative thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are creating and it's all harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one form of drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are really enjoyable forms of
drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bingo, well water, bingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analogs to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, people are afraid of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are afraid of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jump in with both feet because that is the
best way you could have put that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drama is often the analogs to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: No need to fear me, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like the least worrisome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Person ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to cause you no problems,
you know, but I will wake and bake with
[SPEAKER_00]: you every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will use my channel to help spread the
word of cannabis normalization as best as
[SPEAKER_00]: I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll keep supporting my friends like
Dana Larson who do cool fucking things
[SPEAKER_00]: like write books about green buds and
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also be getting some more books
from Dana and giving them away to you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try and get some of those
cannabis and Canada's.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's very generous, so I'm sure he's going
to give us a big pile of books to give
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will probably see me holding up one
of these books for the next week or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to interchange with the other
hats and little things that I have still
[SPEAKER_00]: have a few bottles of the dark crystal and
happy Canada Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you in the room there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bow bow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up AJ PK Brewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well you can buy it actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for saying that because you can
buy Dana's book.
[SPEAKER_00]: At doo doo doo doo doo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you Dana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he's got a little oh here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes PayPal so you can send him a
PayPal at book at Harry pothead net and so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he still got that PayPal
going but you can also Google Dana Larson
[SPEAKER_00]: Google Harry pothead Google it in the name
of anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of his books and you'll come up with
his accounts and how to get in touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: him and if you do want to support him like
I said he is not the worst person that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could choose to support the guy does
really good things and yeah, I just have a
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say enough good about him to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm glad we got that done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was definitely wasn't sure if it was
going to happen getting under my skin
[SPEAKER_00]: making me agitated, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I persevered you guys persevered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that couple hundred people
in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 30 minutes on the clock and.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go have a great Canada Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a wonderful 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're down in America, be safe,
be well, be iry and may the full Mount
[SPEAKER_00]: bless your bowl sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
