[SPEAKER_04]: hey guys welcome to bubble man's world
today we're with the Sasquatch rosin press
[SPEAKER_04]: team and we're gonna be squishing up a
little where is my bike from Karma
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetics we're gonna be squishing it on
the M1 the rosin press the Sasquatch rosin
[SPEAKER_04]: press team was cool enough to fly right up
and do the first press with me
[SPEAKER_04]: 8 gram press now we'll know where we stand
and this is the headband again or the head
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the where's my bike this is the
one I'm really excited about
[SPEAKER_04]: wow it looks almost the same size it's a
lot thinner yeah where's my bike where's
[SPEAKER_04]: my bike's got the major we're gonna see a
good squish off of eight grams aren't we
[SPEAKER_04]: let's do it right boys and girls men and
women
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna collect that I feel like the
best thing I could do is just sit on my
[SPEAKER_04]: ass and film all of this hey what you got
over there with that pump thing there
[SPEAKER_03]: thingamajiggy wouldn't you close it
already with a half a pump three little
[SPEAKER_03]: quick-ass pumps and you're ready to rock
I'd
[SPEAKER_03]: like to do that
[SPEAKER_04]: no it's good to see like little mistakes
and recoveries and sort of flap upward so
[SPEAKER_03]: it's easier to grab so you don't slide
your bag across your freshly made rosin so
[SPEAKER_03]: he's talking about that little there we go
a little half squish pre squish depending
[SPEAKER_03]: on what temperature you're at your pre
squish is gonna be between like five to
[SPEAKER_03]: ten seconds not really much just I always
just did it intuitively and sometimes like
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean a lot of times too people don't do
a preheat right it's not always
[SPEAKER_03]: recommended with certain strains I'm
strange just want to fucking start dumping
[SPEAKER_03]: instantly so a preheats not really
necessary like this bike preheat might
[SPEAKER_03]: darken your product in it with certain
strains so there's no we should actually
[SPEAKER_02]: got you a gauge oh yeah I was asking about
the pressure gauge I can get one you said
[SPEAKER_03]: this is a month old to you or like you're
like three months old three months oh yes
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful dude just flowing I'll tell you
that much it's flowing out of definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: well taken care of dude for sure smell it
you try
[SPEAKER_01]: to get most of it out on the first squish
as well oh yeah for sure 90% a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: times there does nothing comes out on the
second press yeah like I don't do second
[SPEAKER_03]: presses just because there's nothing there
something else yeah I'll give them to
[SPEAKER_03]: people who make edible but yeah some
people make like coconut capsules just
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever cook them down with some coconut
oil and just make some capsules really
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice quality oh it's the smell dude
it's such a nice color look at this so
[SPEAKER_03]: people are aware here if you want to see
this you can see the corners of the bag
[SPEAKER_03]: when when the weed is packed in here it
wasn't squared out yeah so these corners
[SPEAKER_03]: after the fold when you make the fold it
got some oil trapped so like what you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to do is try to square out everything as
much as possible make it nice and square
[SPEAKER_03]: not have any kind of rounded edges so that
when you fold it over it has no voids in
[SPEAKER_03]: the corners try to make sure those corners
are packed up as well so yeah it's a 20
[SPEAKER_01]: upwards of 20% well I'll get this one and
we'll be able to calculate both
[SPEAKER_03]: smell that it looks like it's so much
farther away I'm like right up in it oh
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah all right so let's see what this is
that ended up being 2.3 holy crap 8 25%
[SPEAKER_04]: would be 2 so it's 2.3 it's like 28 29
percent or something damn near 30% yield
[SPEAKER_04]: on that where's my bike beautiful
beautiful I love you you you you you you you
