[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a special guest here today with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a local Vancouver activist,
lawyer, Kirk Toussaint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you from originally?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from just outside of Detroit,
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Detroit, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when you showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be like 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 2002 we came to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kirk's been around a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long time in the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: You worked with Mr. Conroy for a while
there.
I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Conroy QC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Conroy QC.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great mentor, great lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today one of the reasons I invited
Kirk over to talk was the Owen Smith
[SPEAKER_02]: extract edibles case that was recently,
I don't know if you'd call it convened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Judgment rendered by the Court of Appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people are talking about what
it means and what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how it affects Canadians, patients,
designated growers, non-patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought I'd invite Kirk over to go
over a little bit of A, how the case
[SPEAKER_02]: started.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first decision in 2012 and then where
we're at just recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and thanks very much to you,
Bulma, for having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I give you that kind of recap,
your viewers may be interested to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that you actually were the focal point of
two moments in both the trial and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Court of Appeal decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell those stories a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I had the great privilege and
really good fortune to be retained by Owen
[SPEAKER_00]: Smith, who was at the time of his arrest a
baker of edible products and a maker of
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabis based medicines for the
Vancouver Victoria Cannabis Buyers Club of
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, Victoria based, operated by Ted
Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: No relation to Owen Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Owen was making cookies in his
apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell leaked into the hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police showed up and he was arrested
ultimately and charged with possession of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC for the purpose of trafficking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we immediately decided that since he
was making these medicines for sick
[SPEAKER_00]: people, for people who use them for
medicinal purposes to better their quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of life, and because the existing scheme
in Canada at that time did not allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients to use anything other than drive
marijuana in the MMAR, we thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we've got to challenge the law
because people are being helped by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is literally saving some people's
lives, improving the quality of life of
[SPEAKER_00]: other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no reason that Owen Smith
should face five, 10 years in prison
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum for engaging in this behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we launched a constitutional challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2012, we went and did about a 20 day
trial a bunch of members of the club,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very brave people that I was really
honored to meet came and testified about
[SPEAKER_00]: the impact that medical cannabis and
medical cannabis derivative products,
[SPEAKER_00]: either topical products or edible products
or tinctures or concentrated forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids like bubble hash,
for example, how these products assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: them in regaining quality of life or
treating their serious symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they told their stories to the judge
and I had the privilege of helping tell
[SPEAKER_00]: those stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a privilege.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ted Smith testified about the club and the
history and the background of the club,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has been serving and helping people
in Victoria and elsewhere for a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be 15 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right there from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of really a medical cannabis now
revolution in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judge understood that restricting
patients to drive marijuana only violated
[SPEAKER_00]: their dignity, violated their autonomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It infringed on their section seven
charter rights, the liberty and to
[SPEAKER_00]: security of the person in a manner that
wasn't consistent with the principles of
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental justice because the rules and
restrictions were arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made no sense to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to any thinking person why you
can grow and possess the dried product or
[SPEAKER_00]: as a designated producer, you could grow
the dried product and provide it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the minute you put it into a tea
or made it into an oil or turned it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie and wanted to administer it in a
different form than either smoking or
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizing it or a hash or concentrate,
you became a criminal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you could.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous and arbitrary,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The analogy of the tea, you know,
like explaining to the judge that,
[SPEAKER_02]: look, you know, she's using it legally as
a dried herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: The minute she puts it in her hot water,
steeps it and pulls it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because that sounds less like
you're making an extract, but the reality
[SPEAKER_02]: is you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're extracting the cannabinoids into a
weak oral solution and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: ingesting it orally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the medical cannabis forms
you filled in for the government had the
[SPEAKER_00]: option of checking oral, which the judge
found to be puzzling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their Health Canada's document,
information for health care practitioners
[SPEAKER_00]: document is chock full of information
about how to ingest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of studies referenced in the
footnotes about to edibles, topicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sort of like, well,
you're telling doctors about all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and you can check off oral,
but if the patient actually does that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're committing a crime for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we educated the judge about
cannabis and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's where Mark actually comes in,
because he provided me with some very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very good macro photos of trichomes and
closeups of trichomes living from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and from the dried cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was instrumental really in
educating the judge about what the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is and how it's not really in the
plant that is contained in these things
[SPEAKER_00]: called trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really, when you got a visual like
that, right, it sinks it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's educational for certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of what I do in the courtroom is
educate, because most people don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any idea about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, certainly if they're not either
consuming medical cannabis or even if they
[SPEAKER_00]: are, but don't understand really how it's
all working other than it works,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The decision came down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very pleased to win that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judge struck dried marijuana from the
MMAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judge modified the definition of
marijuana in the MMAR to include all
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule two substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that actually included synthetic THC,
for example, but basically cannabis resin,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything you can make with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he strike the word dried?
[SPEAKER_02]: He struck it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just use the word marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which he also helped define as all of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: As all of these schedule two substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately that remedy gets disagreed
with in the court of appeal when we get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other side appeals, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go and argue the appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spent about half of the oral
argument time discussing a legal concept
[SPEAKER_00]: called standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this becomes relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was a dissenting opinion in
the court of appeal that dealt with the
[SPEAKER_00]: standing issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And standing is basically your right to
make certain arguments to the court.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have, for instance,
in a search warrant situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a reasonable expectation of
privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your home, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your buddy sitting on the porch in
your home does not have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable expectation of privacy in your
home that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your buddy doesn't have standing to
raise, for example, a challenge to the
[SPEAKER_00]: search warrant in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they get caught up in a bus,
then they happen to have some drugs on
[SPEAKER_00]: them or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were otherwise arrested and
validly searched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if the search warrant that got the
cops in the front of your house was
[SPEAKER_00]: completely invalid, that person has no
standing to raise that because the charter
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't confer to them a right of privacy
in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it wasn't their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the argument on standing that the court
grappled with was, well, Oman Smith is not
[SPEAKER_00]: a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was not a participant in the MMAR
scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, he wasn't a designated
producer producing for a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had no license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is he in a position to challenge
whether or not the MMAR are arbitrary and
[SPEAKER_00]: unconstitutional?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is given by the Supreme
Court of Canada quite a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is he's being charged under a
criminal statute.
[SPEAKER_00]: His liberty is at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the criminal statute, the Controlled
Drugs and Substances Act, under which he
[SPEAKER_00]: will be convicted, you're arguing is
unconstitutional because the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: exemption is unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't think, and in fact,
the Crown agreed, this is well-settled
[SPEAKER_00]: case law.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we spent a bunch of time in the Court
of Appeal on that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now ultimately, we won in the Court of
Appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened in 2014 just a couple
of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredibly pleased to get a great result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of the judges of the three agreed that
the charter is breached, that your right
[SPEAKER_00]: to life, liberty, and security of the
person is breached by the restriction to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry marijuana only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they used some very good language in
the decision about what Section 7 actually
[SPEAKER_00]: protects, because it's not just about
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these rights that we have under the
charter, and the right that was
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreted in the VC Court of Appeal was,
they said, look, this choice of medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: the choice of the mode of ingestion of a
physician-approved medicine like this goes
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamentally to what it means to have
dignity and independence and autonomy in
[SPEAKER_00]: our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was absolutely spot on
and great language, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super compelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puts a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you read that and you're like,
you know what, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what it means in a free and
democratic society to have liberty and
[SPEAKER_00]: security of your person.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't make medical choices for
yourself, what do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's almost not even a medical choice
as much as it's like, okay, you're legally
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed to order pizza, but if you take it
out of the box, you have breached a
[SPEAKER_02]: serious law and could potentially serve
time in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no, wait a minute, why would
you even do that to your people?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like an entrapment of sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a tragedy, and it's an ongoing
tragedy, and it obviously should be fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to fix it is obviously the
outright legalization of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the second best way to fix it is to
implement a working medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: system in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've got a long way to go
before we have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We win.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a two to one decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dissent wrote about standing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He felt that Mr. Smith shouldn't be able
to challenge these laws because he wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: a participant in the scheme in any way,
didn't try to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sort of say, well, he couldn't
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he could not have applied under
the MMAR to bake cookies for the members
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Cannabis Buyers Club of Canada in
Victoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: He couldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the point of doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of what I said in the Court of
Appeal, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, two of the judges agreed with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also luckily, Supreme Court of Canada
precedent was on our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Crown quite honorably and
correctly conceded that point at the start
[SPEAKER_00]: of the oral argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, I think a great decision,
a great step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited to have been a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be on the way of the Supreme Court
of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a dissent if the Crown wants to
go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they have an automatic right of
appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even have to ask permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what a dissent is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one in my case years ago for my
side, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two judges were against me, but one
thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a few reasons why.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a point, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a case I actually use from time to
time in various proceedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you, here's the other way,
Mark, assisted here with the Court of
[SPEAKER_00]: Appeal decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in the courtroom for oral
argument in the Court of Appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually stole one of your lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was saying to the judges,
explaining what a trichome is,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, because you've got to educate
them, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you've got to think about it
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes, the resin glands,
that's the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the message, the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the messenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody that watches Bubble Man's
world has heard Bubble Man say those
[SPEAKER_00]: words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herb is the messenger, and bubble is the
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can definitely accept that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it don't bubble, it ain't worth the
trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the skunk man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first one I used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I came up with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I might have a t-shirt or two of
that on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun to be able to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's true, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very, very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you definitely have vast knowledge
when it comes to cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: how they're produced, where they're
produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: A vast knowledge that a lot of people
don't really have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, even in our scene, in the scene
that is the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice to see someone in your
position who can stand up and get these
[SPEAKER_02]: laws not only fight them, but potentially
change them.
[SPEAKER_02]: To have a good, solid foundation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm constantly disappointed when I see a
media story done on cannabis because they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't seem to be inspired to do great
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't seem to be inspired to be like,
don't you have one guy who will just be
[SPEAKER_02]: really good and learn about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can learn about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very frustrating to sort of read
things that are so inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's so much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate the compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice of you to cuss up from somebody
with a knowledge base that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely know what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, God thank us, because if someone
else was standing up there trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: defend this without that knowledge,
in my opinion, that simple knowledge of
[SPEAKER_02]: explaining where the cannabinoids are
manufactured inside the glandular trichome
[SPEAKER_02]: head, and that it's such a small,
small percentage of the actual plant
[SPEAKER_02]: matter, there's a huge understanding that
would literally change everything that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're even fighting against right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the joys of being a
litigator is that you get to learn a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about interesting subject matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been privileged to be able to do
a lot of litigation involving medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, marijuana generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the plants and have for my
entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been an absolute privilege to be
able to blend those two disciplines
[SPEAKER_00]: together and try to do good work for
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess my one last question would
be, where do we sit with this decision?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this mean that patients that have MMA
are at this point with the injunction
[SPEAKER_02]: going on are able to possess and make
their own decisions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the question of the day,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very interesting scenario because
when the trial judge granted us the relief
[SPEAKER_00]: we were seeking, the Crown asked for a
year for the government to fix the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked for his ruling, essentially,
to be suspended for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a suspension of a declaration
of invalidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives the government a chance to
respond legislatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it after Parker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it a bit after one of the hitsig
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they did after Barron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the judge did is he said,
well, as to patients, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go into effect right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an authorized person,
you can make your edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your concentrates and other
derivative products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a patient, if you're a
designated producer, then we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give the government a year to legislate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the end of that year,
government hadn't done anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came back asking for more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the judge, I think, quite rightly
said, well, I'm not just going to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: more time to give you more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you a year to do something,
not to do nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he denied that relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at that point, designated producers
in BC became able to produce all Schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: II substances for their patients,
including bubble hash, including dry sift,
[SPEAKER_00]: including edibles, topicals, you name it,
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretically, even pure synthetic THC
could have been produced by designated
[SPEAKER_00]: producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this Court of Appeal modified the
remedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said the judge sort of went a little
bit too far in granting the relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it was unconstitutional to limit
patients to dry marijuana only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it violates their Section VII rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the judge actually rewrote the
MMAR to redefine marijuana as all Schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: II substances, rather than just sort of
throwing the ball back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: government's court and saying,
here's the problem, fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they modified that remedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said to the extent of changing the
remedy, we're actually going to grant the
[SPEAKER_00]: Crown relief on this appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to declare that those
provisions limiting the patients to dry
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana only are arbitrary, violate
Section VII.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to suspend that
declaration for a year to give the
[SPEAKER_00]: government a chance to respond
legislatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what does that mean for patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the government's really been given
a year to amend a regulatory scheme that
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer exists in order to allow
patients to have access to these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens in the meantime?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are designated producers now unable to
produce for their patients when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: a week and a half ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we won the Section VII issue,
are patients no longer able to make their
[SPEAKER_00]: own medicines in British Columbia or
anywhere in the country?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think these are some unanswered
questions by the way the remedy section of
[SPEAKER_00]: the decision was crafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got to be honest with you,
I've got to think about it myself before I
[SPEAKER_00]: leap to judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to talk to some smart people about
that, like Mr. Conroy, and take some
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance on what it really means.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is it not set up in a way that you can
be like, okay, we need to understand,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a few questions in regards to your
ruling.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way to get more, any back and
forth with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm unaware of any.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really a dialogue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a presentation followed by a
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there firms that you can hire that
have brilliant people that just specialize
[SPEAKER_02]: in looking at cases and then telling you
what they believe that case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you could, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go to a constitutional lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get a legal opinion on what the
impact is and you could have some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could place some value and some stock
in that and let that guide your actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, of course, could go to the Supreme
Court of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: My client Owen has not made any decisions
about whether we want to go to the Supreme
[SPEAKER_00]: Court of Canada because perhaps we don't
agree with that remedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, as somebody that's been an
observer of how the government's responded
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past to declarations of
constitutional invalidity, I don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous amount of confidence that this
time they're going to do it the right way
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's not, unfortunately,
the track record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, all of this, you know,
there's two other issues that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: arises.
[SPEAKER_00]: How valid is this decision out of British
Columbia?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more impactful than the trial
court decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not it's completely binding
across the country, I think, is a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: question that would have to be settled
maybe even on a province-by-province
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other issue is, does it
affect the MMPR?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are producers under the MMPR
going to be allowed to now provide these
[SPEAKER_00]: products to their patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: So far the answer is no, but perhaps
that's part of the government's regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a strong feeling that part of their
reason to allow it is that they'll want to
[SPEAKER_02]: allow it for LPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why they didn't do that in
the first place, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's difficult to sort
of understand the government's thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: behind a lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just can't, I don't really see,
like, small amounts of dried flour as
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for some it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to be fair, for some people that
is their preferred mode of ingestion and
[SPEAKER_00]: their right to choose it is part of their
individual dignity, autonomy, and
[SPEAKER_00]: independence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would fight for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you would, and I know you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just happen to have a different mode
of ingestion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what, and not even that,
but lately I get a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: since I started this group on Facebook
called the Endocannabinoid System,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had almost daily a person who has
been diagnosed with a terminal illness
[SPEAKER_02]: contact me and ask me how they can get
what they need and what is it that they
[SPEAKER_02]: need, and I'm like, well, you need to
saturate your endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to take like a gram of
concentrated resin-gland heads,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's different ways of,
like it's, even when I pull out my creams
[SPEAKER_02]: that are the CBC cream that's good for
muscle pain and stuff, everyone sees it
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're like, oh, I need to get some
of that, where can I get some of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, you know, it would be
nice if you could just get it at the
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacy or any of these other,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the supermarket, at the dispensary,
at the, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not available enough in the
model that we're currently in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, and truth be told,
I mean, the medicine is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, in the resin glands,
and that is where it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the stuff is extraneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have other impact, flavor,
taste, people prefer to ingest in a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain way, but at the end of the day,
we know where the medicine results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in one of Owen Smith's most recent
blogs there on cannabis digest,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote quite a bit about Dave Pate,
who was the, did work for Horta Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of our experts in sports.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he is an expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, and if you read Dave Pate's words,
it's like, all the medicinal value is in
[SPEAKER_02]: the glandular head of the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, all of the transcripts from
the trial, including Dr. Pate's testimony,
[SPEAKER_00]: are available online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's at cannabisdigest.ca,
or if not, you can certainly find a link
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great site worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good site worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I really appreciate your time,
Kirk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great to come up here to your
place and enjoy your hospitality and have
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity to talk to the people that
love bubble man as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk to you guys soon.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
