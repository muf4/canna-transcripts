Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome to bubble man's world absolutely
beautiful Sunset going off here Boxing day
[SPEAKER_00]: December 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost at the end of the year and I
thought I wanted to put out at least one
[SPEAKER_00]: more video Saying thank you to all all of
you out there who have shared your kind
[SPEAKER_00]: comments And your good words people that
have asked questions people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: learned people that have shared I just
want to thank you all for really pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: the boundaries of water extraction and dry
sifting I've seen a huge growth in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last just year even I even have to thank
you know believe it or not BHO you know
[SPEAKER_00]: all these people that have Come to learn
about cannabis through BHO are now finding
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves Looking for something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for that next thing and
you know while a certain Amount of those
[SPEAKER_00]: people will stay with the BHO when they'll
specialize upon it And they'll become you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the people at the top of that game
the majority of people aren't accessing
[SPEAKER_00]: really clean good quality oils It's
dangerous people are getting injured,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's really nice to see a lot of people
Coming around and just Seeing that that
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sifting and wet washing can produce
equally as dabble of a product as you
[SPEAKER_00]: often like to say I've got my D nail going
right here I've got a little bit of dabble
[SPEAKER_00]: product right here, and I figured I'd just
share a few bowls with you Here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few days of the year you know Send my
my wishes to all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you had a great holiday season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Hope that you had lots of melty hash I'm
going to hit the straight fab here with
[SPEAKER_00]: the silhouette of the epic Cloudy sunset
coming in got the D nail set up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: quartz Bowl the puking bee Yeah,
I've got a little Converter from 14 to 18
[SPEAKER_00]: that higher end gave me High integrity
glass, and we're going to dab up a few
[SPEAKER_00]: hits with you
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful Wanted to um You know kind of go
over the year in bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an exciting year for bubble bags
With the with the growth of water
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction over the last few years Bubble
bags has You know both received the
[SPEAKER_00]: markets welcome in how we produce and sell
bags we've I guess What bubble bags has
[SPEAKER_00]: done is we've listened to the marketplace?
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand that the high-end bubble
bags will always have their place,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also this year decided to come up
with a More inexpensive version of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble bags the bubble bag lights You may
have seen the video on urban Remos channel
[SPEAKER_00]: the urban grower on his YouTube channel of
us making bubble together with the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: or John Berfalo, and I'm making bubble
together Using the bubble bag lights with
[SPEAKER_00]: his whole Fresh frozen plants those are
all on on the channel you can check them
[SPEAKER_00]: out if you haven't already So that's
really been great and another thing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been really great is the act absolute
explosion of dry sifting you know for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last Longest time I Just didn't see a lot
of dry sift and it seemed everywhere I
[SPEAKER_00]: turned this year from Being at when I
asked everyone at the Cannabis Cup this
[SPEAKER_00]: year if anyone had full melt dry sift I
saw many hands go up in the crowd which
[SPEAKER_00]: was a huge jump from last year's none So
that's really great sharing this
[SPEAKER_00]: information over the course of the last
few years teaching people how to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: carding techniques You know showing people
how to gently and lightly extract heads
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a rough extraction And a cleaning
they both have their place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been great saw some absolute
beautiful 99% gland head hash probably by
[SPEAKER_00]: at least half a dozen people at the
Cannabis Cup this year, so that was really
[SPEAKER_00]: really great to see and My own friends,
you know John B D4 20k on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been making some really beautiful
beautiful hash Some dry sifting will have
[SPEAKER_00]: a video coming up with him In the next
month or two I'm not sure if I'm gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: making it up to his neck of the woods Or
if he's gonna be coming down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're definitely gonna get together
We're gonna do some dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk about techniques We're
gonna you know show some macro photography
[SPEAKER_00]: and get you guys get you guys inspired to
make this this full melt Wet wash and dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift you know these 99% pure gland heads
That were grown properly allowed to mature
[SPEAKER_00]: and because of it you get that melty
dabble product does it dab does it melt?
[SPEAKER_00]: The purity is only half if that the real
trick is the quality plus the purity Then
[SPEAKER_00]: you get something worth smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: Well favorite products of 2013 let me see
most of them are sitting here with me
[SPEAKER_00]: right now This mothership bomb I can't
remember being this happy with a pipe in a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time It was also the first time I
actually bought a pipe In a long time I
[SPEAKER_00]: almost forgot people have been giving me
pipes for so long And I've always
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciated it, but it's like the
conversation I had with Brian from D nail
[SPEAKER_00]: another product that I've absolutely loved
this year one of my favorites Is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer to feel the sting of buying a
product so I can actually judge it
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately and really feel that That's
something I like based upon the money that
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big deal It's it's easy to get
given a product and Have that skew your
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective on how much you actually like
it Because often when we pay for things
[SPEAKER_00]: the earning of money and the spending of
the money we like to Compare the value
[SPEAKER_00]: versus that money, so we'll buy something
for a thousand dollars when we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll think Was that a thousand dollars
worth of whatever that product was that I
[SPEAKER_00]: got?
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter the product people do it
inevitably whether they admit it or not
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just felt for the money that I spent
on the D nail which was well below a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand dollars I've just been really
happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took it to the cannabis cup it
performed exceptional I love that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: use it on a pipe, and I can move it freely
This piece here is quite light sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets a little bit twisted Which is
simply untwisted by just twisting because
[SPEAKER_00]: the cord is so light You can actually do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that the cord doesn't get caught on
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that it's not Pulling things off of
my table if I have it up on the table It's
[SPEAKER_00]: not knocking over jars of hash,
and that's one of the things I really like
[SPEAKER_00]: about this unit I could go on for a long
time about the efficiency It's something
[SPEAKER_00]: to say that since I got this unit I think
I may have lit a beeline like twice and
[SPEAKER_00]: each time I did it it was just less
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just gained I've got used to this
sort of hit Also a product that's not here
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want to give a mention to which is
really the first product that I got turned
[SPEAKER_00]: on to this year that gave me similar
bubble hits to this but On an even
[SPEAKER_00]: different level because this product you
can use cannabis combined with bubble or
[SPEAKER_00]: either or and that would be the sublimator
I Know I've posted a few videos of it
[SPEAKER_00]: before it is a bigger more awkward unit I
think it's best Suited right now to be
[SPEAKER_00]: brought you go to the sublimator It's not
something you want to pass around and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to sometimes explain to people that
it's hot and not to touch much like the D
[SPEAKER_00]: Nail I like to tell people this is very
hot and you shouldn't touch it and So with
[SPEAKER_00]: doing those two simple things you can
really Share quite an experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: someone and give them a nice sublimator
rip because to this day I got to give it
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the sublimator for being one of the
tastiest hits I've ever taken hands down
[SPEAKER_00]: John B Would agree with me because it was
his Cush's we were puffing I think he had
[SPEAKER_00]: finger rub and he even one day brought
over fresh-cut herb that we hit through
[SPEAKER_00]: the sublimator and it even tasted Amazing,
so it's quite something to check out You
[SPEAKER_00]: can check them out at sublimator calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe if not, we definitely also carry
them on fresh head ease calm We also carry
[SPEAKER_00]: the D Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We however do not carry the mother ships
But you can check out high integrity glass
[SPEAKER_00]: art on Facebook or Instagram for these bad
boys I know they specialize in the
[SPEAKER_00]: province of British Columbia But they may
or may not be able to sell you a piece if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're outside of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check it out with them Another
little product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't mention too often,
but you see me always using are the
[SPEAKER_00]: skillet tools I've seen a few come and go
since skillet tool has been around and I
[SPEAKER_00]: still am a favorite of the skillet tool I
love the Bucket on the the scooper I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just perfect for dry sift and bubble
and the little corner piece the little
[SPEAKER_00]: dabber on the other end It's perfect as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I can dab my my bubble with it I
can scoop my powder granule stuff with it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just think it's a really all-around
great product and one that I use every day
[SPEAKER_00]: I Obviously actually use all of these
products every day and of course my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite is the one that my product makes
bubble hash Yeah, 99% pure gland heads
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted with the help the water and the
ice are doing everything for you So as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as you follow simple instructions and
allow them to isolate the gland heads for
[SPEAKER_00]: you It's a no-brainer You can expect to
have some of the purest Gland head hash
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ever seen water and ice made that
possible pre 97 98 Which is when the world
[SPEAKER_00]: really learned about water extraction and
I say that in a public manner many people
[SPEAKER_00]: knew about it decades earlier But more the
information was more Isolated now the
[SPEAKER_00]: information with the internet is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people know about it and so That
really changed the game to allow people to
[SPEAKER_00]: have something at this level like I
remember it specifically Because really
[SPEAKER_00]: before 1999 which was when bubble bags
came out and really popularized the method
[SPEAKER_00]: we really through overgrow and the timing
and digital cameras and Everything just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of clicked and it became that It
became you know, it was the time for that
[SPEAKER_00]: information to spark and for people to
grab it I know I hear a lot of people now
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that it's it's really happening now
because that's exponential from what all
[SPEAKER_00]: the work that was done in the late 90s to
to that, you know to 2005 and then 2005 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010 and 2008 each time each, you know,
four or five years It's this exponential
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and it's seemingly been like that
for almost since its inception So I look
[SPEAKER_00]: very forward to see where water extraction
as well as dry sifting will take us in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014 year I look forward to sharing a lot
of cool videos with you I've got ideas of
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially going to Jamaica potentially
going to Nepal Kathmandu Of course this
[SPEAKER_00]: winter we want to do an ice cave session
take you guys out to the Pemberton ice
[SPEAKER_00]: caps by snowmobile and Maybe make some dry
sift and some wet wash in an ice cave,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know stay overnight Do some time-lapse
photography of the stars and put together
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice video for you guys I hope you guys
have been enjoying this I'm gonna leave
[SPEAKER_00]: you now with one more rip beautiful sunset
and Feel free to leave a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love to read your comments And
