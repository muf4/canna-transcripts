[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys welcome to bubble man's world I
am sitting here today and I'm trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: down my moms making sure they stay short I
don't want these tall lanky moms so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to cut out these perfectly beautiful
it's an afghani right there can tell from
[SPEAKER_00]: the structure and the smell I got ooh
sweet skunk look at that big seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: such a shame but I was telling Dr. Atomic
the other day when he was here and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: giving him clones that take as many as you
can because soon I'll just be tossing them
[SPEAKER_00]: away anyway keep your moms down don't let
them get too tall cut them down these two
[SPEAKER_00]: here are not moms these are the BC hash
plants these BC hash plants have been a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit hurting they've got the classic
copper deficiency leaf curl happening I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure if this is a copper deficiency
but I'm going to be flushing them today
[SPEAKER_00]: with a half-power food and pH to 6.3 and
hopefully that will bring this out they've
[SPEAKER_00]: both been exactly the same they're the
only two plants that are doing this and
[SPEAKER_00]: every time the new health comes out it
seems to be seems to be healthy but
[SPEAKER_00]: everything below that seems to be stressed
a little bit so these are the things I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out in my garden keeping the moms
down I've got a tent blooming right now
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've got another tent about to be
finished vegging so just giving you the
[SPEAKER_00]: update thanks for watching bubble man's
