[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to be doing a little
review on a quite a wonderful little unit
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've been excited to get for quite
some time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Grasshopper Vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they make them both in stainless steel
as well as titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unit is 100% titanium, the titanium
unit as it will, and it was passed along
[SPEAKER_00]: to me this year in Spain, in Barcelona,
at the Spannibus, and I wanted to give a
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Vape Fiend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check his website out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his card in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just pull out all the little
utensils and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Vape Fiend, yes, George Alexander
is the CEO and the founder, and you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can hook him up with him at www
.vapefiend.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: www .vapefiend.co.uk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Europe, Vaporizer Wizard is
great to hook up with if you are in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, and of course you can always check
out grasshoppervaporizer.com and go right
[SPEAKER_00]: to the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a cool little Grasshopper sticker
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing comes basic, I'm not sure if
it actually comes with this or if he
[SPEAKER_00]: kicked me down a little extra,
he gave me two extra batteries,
[SPEAKER_00]: rechargeable Li-ion 3.7 volt 750mAh.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the model GHB1, and it also says
Hopper Labs and has the little Grasshopper
[SPEAKER_00]: logo on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got one with the unit itself,
as well as the two extras, so that's very
[SPEAKER_00]: nice to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the really cool things about
this unit that I thought was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting was how it charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the classic USB charger,
but it's got this little guy here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to kind of show you up close
how kind of cool this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got this little guy, and basically
it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just attach it, it's magnetic,
and that's how you charge the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really thought that was cool,
kind of futuristic, much like these new
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple iPhones and such with their easy to
charge, just place it down and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: magnetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit itself is very, very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top switches here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can twist the entire top to open up
the unit, and remove the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one of the batteries right
there, and it's just a real simple unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Titanium, pop that battery in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn this little guy to spin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The threads grab real nice and easy on all
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things I like about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's five settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the top here, you have a little pen
clicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your basic setting,
and then you go to two, to three,
[SPEAKER_00]: to four, and to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, each person is going to
enjoy their vapor at a different level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got this cool little silicon
piece that I guess originally I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: was for a mouthpiece, but then I realized
if I just gently put it into my down stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: or sorry, my drop down, I could actually
take rips through my pipe as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be doing that here in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a vaporizer for flowers,
for herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not believe it's a unit that you
would use concentrates for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told just to use flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You unscrew the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a very small three little
threaded piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside this titanium piece, you've got a
little screen inside so that when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: inhaling, you're not inhaling the dust or
the small particulate of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then inside here, it's got as well
another perforated laser screen with three
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny holes in the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why don't we just get going right
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown a little bit of my own little
Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you guys a little, give you guys a
little see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of going out of the,
out of the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to take it too close to
the camera, but that's some of my Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: from 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess simply enough, we'll just
crush a little nugget of it into this
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only used the unit once myself so
far, and it was quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a little, review on Periscope
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Periscope was a little bit
glitchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, you know, I think this
vaporizer deserves a full review on my
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to give that shout out to
Vape Fiend for hooking it up and Vaporizer
[SPEAKER_00]: Wizard in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've sent some units in the past,
so I thought I'd pass their address on as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Grasshopper Vaporizer,
who is the one that put this unit
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it nice and stuffed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take a few different varieties of
hits here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite parts about the
pen now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to set it on four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You click it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get these little red lights that come
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about four seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue, it's up to temperature and you can
already start vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice light vapor coming out right at the
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real nice tasty, tasty flavors on those
first few rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming through exactly like the flavor of
the herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an outdoor grown herb that I grew
out on my deck so I can taste that outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: sun grown quality to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try a few rips through the
mothership and see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twistin' real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't feel janky or loose at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that was a surprisingly huge rip that
I got off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely different from hitting it on
the unit by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water created this incredible suction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a little click off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little empty, empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when it doesn't empty right
away, that means that you've got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of resin still left in there and you
could probably take a few more hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if you guys can see this,
but I've got a little picture to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say it's less than a quarter of a
gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit cleans really nice and easy
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm quite impressed with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try a little bit of the Astro Boy
that I've had curing for well over a year
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff hits just beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great terpene profile on the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just smell and taste that unique
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying that the Jamaican didn't have a
very nice unique flavor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Astro Boy is just much more fruity and
really gives that sort of fruity rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of holding my finger over
the top and blowing out where the thread
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't get a buildup of resin
in those threads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that it could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that out a little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a quick click and we'll count this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four, and it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to go for first a
clean rip right out of the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God, is that tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to go right into the bong now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a pretty incredible little unit
for the size and for the efficiency and
[SPEAKER_00]: for how fast it heats up, how easy it is
to clean, how easy it is to roll with it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasty treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get to enjoy flowers very often as
I'm mainly a hash smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though now people could argue that
I'm hitting flowers, really what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: is I'm hot air extracting the hash off of
the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the flowers are being left
over, nicely detriconed, completely
[SPEAKER_00]: removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm impressed with this little unit,
I've got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't believe the taste right down to the
end as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really just continually hitting a nice
flavorful rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to tell you how long the battery
lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I'm going to have to get
back to you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't killed one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using it yesterday and I used it
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm by no means hitting it like a
fiend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit maybe four or five bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, it would be nice to know exactly
how many full chambers you can hit with a
[SPEAKER_00]: single battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's why they give you a second
battery too for that very reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to just click on and off and get
it back up to temperature if it's cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: down on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, excellent little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will maybe be a two parter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get back to you guys and let you
know how durable it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how I'm very hard on these units.
[SPEAKER_00]: I travel with them and I roll with them in
a way that I definitely don't treat them
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat them like they're a unit and that
they're going to last.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat them very much like the way I
would treat my bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them clean and put them away all the
time, but at the same time, by no means do
[SPEAKER_00]: I baby them when it's work time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unit right here being 100% titanium
really gives me the feel that it's to
[SPEAKER_00]: last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the silicon mouthpiece, which I
regularly really don't like these very
[SPEAKER_00]: much, it's not your average one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a silicon wrapped around a
silicon tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very thick up here and very thin down
here, much like those cheap ones that you
[SPEAKER_00]: get with all the pens that you can just
put on top of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more like a two part unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it another click.
[SPEAKER_00]: For it to be able to turn on that fast is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, three seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good old vapor cough happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming out of the end of the cold and that
little bit of that real nice little hit
[SPEAKER_00]: that it gives you just grabs you by the
throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm going to give a shout out to
the Grasshopper Vaporizer crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to Vape Fiend
for hooking me up with this in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize that it took so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sick for almost three weeks there,
but here I am reviewing the unit and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to say it's a great little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way it looks like a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super nondescript does not look like your
regular vapor pens in any way,
[SPEAKER_00]: shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually looks like a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to those guys for doing such
a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having such a successful Kickstarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think I'm going to be a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea of bringing around a
little bit of crushed up herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that might be
important to you if you want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizers like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I'm getting the rips that
I'm getting is because I've dried the
[SPEAKER_00]: herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This herb has actually been dried for
months and it was really going to be used
[SPEAKER_00]: for dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably even just a little bit
just past dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rips that you get out of it
because of it are these really responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the difference between hitting a
fresh plant and hitting properly dried
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a good lesson for you bubble
heads and dry sifters out there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh frozen is going to be twice as hard
to dry properly than cured, properly cured
[SPEAKER_00]: bud that is then washed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with dry sifting, you are not dry
sifting if you haven't dried the material
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is properly dried material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits perfect in a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's responsive to vaporizing the second
the heat gets there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the heat doesn't have to work its way
through a moist wax membrane to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess nothing left to do but thank
you guys for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get back to you here soon on
Bubble Man's World with some more great
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews, some more great videos,
and hopefully some hash making here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot Grasshopper Vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you George from Vape Fiends.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time on Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man's World.
Bubble Man's World.
