[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am here at my good friend Merlin's place
and we are going to be heading up to
[SPEAKER_03]: Squamish today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out a little grow and hopefully pick
some edible mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess this is Puff Wednesday without
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was waiting for him to show up but I
still haven't heard from him today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I doubt Johnny is going to be there but
we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to a pretty popular place up
in Squamish that people pick for edible
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not really looking for psychedelics
today but we should find some edibles
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually a pretty hot spot for
chanterelles and a couple other different
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties, cauliflowers and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fingers crossed, we're going to jump in
the vehicle right here right away and head
[SPEAKER_03]: up because it's already almost 11 o'clock
and I'm sure a lot of people will be out
[SPEAKER_03]: there already.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a little quick shot of the
view here at my buddy's house and then
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to head out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful Lions Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready to get this party started?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright guys, let's go jump in the truck
and head up to Squamish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you coming with us buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you coming with us?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you coming with us?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're coming with us, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is Brixton.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a brand new little dude and he's
going to come mushroom picking with us
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got his little unit on.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's ready to rip, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready to rip and roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we've made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're up in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with Merlin and Brixton.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brixton's in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's so cute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Merlin and I are neighbors and friends and
we also kind of work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's part of Can Mart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm part of Embark and we've just kind of
worked out a little deal together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll see more Embark, Can Mart
synergies, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collaborations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collaborations, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, today we're just Puff
Wednesdaying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were waiting for Johnny B but there's
no Johnny B for today's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we thought we would do,
and we're not sure how successful we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: be, we came to Squamish to walk through
and pick some edible mushrooms in this
[SPEAKER_03]: forest just over to our left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we do that, Merlin's going to roll
a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a dab and then we'll get
ourselves, well, we'll get him finally
[SPEAKER_03]: running around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before he pukes in the truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before he pukes in the truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you haven't puked in this truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll probably puke on the way home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, just puffing on a little of the
cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give you guys a little show on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, super good quality there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super good quality there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just smoking some Tom Ford.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Tom Ford.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's make this happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what I got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my temp tech, which will be fairly
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely loving this JP Toro banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I have to say thank you every
time I hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of smoke coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always so hard to clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the night you spent a while
cleaning that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I'm telling you, I was giving you
guys dabs out of a Chast banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't even like, do you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you noticed, I had a different banger
for everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did see that in the longer one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get right, we'll get that right out
of your face, Brixton.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no need for you to have bubble
smoke in your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's young though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to be, I'll give him a nice
clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Window down, smoke gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to have a dab before you get into the
forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is just walking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a while when you're foraging
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, anyone that is being
inspired by this video, I'll tell you
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to find a local amateur mycologist in
your area, a group of mycologists,
[SPEAKER_03]: some information online.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all sorts of great things,
anything that has Paul Stamets name on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because picking mushrooms is something you
should be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys have two big full bags of
mushrooms right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever mushroom you find, if you're not
200% sure, don't eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When in doubt, throw it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: People ask, is it edible?
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single mushroom is edible one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to stay away from the ones that
are only edible one time because those are
[SPEAKER_03]: poisonous and they generally kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be careful out there when you're
picking mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to clean my banger and we're
going to get into the forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just heading into the forest here
in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can tell right away,
right off the streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just an epic forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like fairy tale land,
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, let's head right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll head to the back of the woodlot
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so beautiful in here, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What a blessing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this conk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's trying to grow right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a red belted polypore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's probably been broken
off or cut off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, what else we got over here?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some more little guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: More over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another guy right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Brixton.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you feeling better?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, bro, I was going to puke in
your truck so hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point, I didn't know if I wanted to
shit myself or puke.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he was saying to himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see it on his face and I know you
could see it on his face.
[SPEAKER_03]: He looked nervous for the last 10 minutes
of the ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you know, it would have been fine if
he barfed in the truck though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean he's done it in mine a few
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not tripping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another red belted polypore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so sweet in here.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have those only in Whistler,
supposedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard of them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not up in Whistler, I haven't,
but that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't push play.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't recording that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just did a whole nice intro talking about
bringing you guys on this adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to repeat myself,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue to show you guys a little bit of
mushrooms that we find in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we find some edibles that we
recognize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said before, when you don't
recognize them, it's best to just probably
[SPEAKER_03]: not even pick them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's definitely best to not eat them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to film this weird mushroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's some witches brew.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been walking around for about a half
an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless there's a huge flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually walk around for about a half an
hour plus before I kind of get to my zone
[SPEAKER_03]: and start pulling things up out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see how it goes for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might be a little early.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might not be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of hoping that we're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some really big mushrooms popping out of
the forest floor here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just not necessarily the ones we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, this is a very popular spot,
so a lot of people do pick in and around
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that, Brixton?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they sure did.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sure did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's way over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong?
[SPEAKER_03]: On what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were stung.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get these little yellows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always good to just cut them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That little guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll head back over here where
we saw another nice flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are actually, I didn't actually see
this flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing it for the first time,
but look how big these ones are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Brixton, you silly little dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some yellows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice color on these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that cool?
[SPEAKER_03]: We were like, we just walked by these
ones, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're hard to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful colors and look at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just, once you start, there's more
and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always best to make sure it's a nice
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was a nice one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited for you to cook with these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a really nice soup with like a huge
bag full of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so creamy.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are
[SPEAKER_04]: small, but they're one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Merle's picking up some more
yellow folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just getting little babies,
but one thing you may or may not know
[SPEAKER_03]: about Merlin is that he is an exceptional
chef and he'll make something very nice
[SPEAKER_03]: and fancy and delicious out of these
yellow foots and he'll figure out a way to
[SPEAKER_03]: pull that flavor out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they're still quite small.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just found this little purple mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we figured we'd share.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got another, maybe just don't pick the
rotten one there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've got gold there, they're
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be all around us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in a patch right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see them over by the tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a big one standing out right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another patch behind right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny how it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this one you're not looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flush right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're popping out right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_04]: More here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess these are indicators.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time I found them next
to these big ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in the middle of saying these aren't
really indicators and then I lit then you
[SPEAKER_03]: walked right by that little patch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sticking right out nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Picking mushrooms is a trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our friend who's coming to meet
us here and we're in a pretty big chunk of
[SPEAKER_03]: land.
[SPEAKER_03]: So his phone died and that's why Merlin is
screaming his name every few minutes so he
[SPEAKER_03]: can find us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, come to papa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to papa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a whole, whole bunch, but a nice
little, nice little bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're all over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll go all around this whole stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I found this little guy and it kind of
goes around this, but as I was sitting,
[SPEAKER_03]: Merlin could see underneath me were more
chanterelles and there's a line of
[SPEAKER_03]: chanterelles that heads in this direction
and it probably crosses the path and heads
[SPEAKER_03]: over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's pick these.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want this, Merlin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad we went mushroom picking today,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you just find it meditative and
medicinal somewhat?
[SPEAKER_01]: The woods are the best place to calm down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the better parts of picking
mushrooms is you get to just chill in the
[SPEAKER_01]: woods and find treasures for dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forging with a chef.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you are a chef.
[SPEAKER_03]: Self-proclaimed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proclaiming it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that flush though, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like pretty much a blessing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little flush of goldies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or yellows, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, these are gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't they nice mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yellows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yellow foots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you can see, we're having a pretty
good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a level of relaxation that occurs
when you're picking mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just sort of saw this over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I'd come and share.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like a boulder right here,
covered in moss.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's growing out of the boulder?
[SPEAKER_03]: But a tiny little mushroom, a little pea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that little guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want the attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, Brixton.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you broke it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: You broke it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, I think that's a bolette.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little bolette right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't recognize this one for sure,
so I'll be leaving it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I honestly think that that's what that
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, when in doubt, just leave it
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just leave it be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we walked right through here with
no visual whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then suddenly, it was a yellow foots
kind of everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to grab like these ones?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just this whole other patch right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some more nicies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show these guys some chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That color is absolutely gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be all over in here,
I have a feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right next to the stump again.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're definitely over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't we see them when we came over here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was it over here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have my knife?
[SPEAKER_01]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Merlin, your knife is over in the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what happens when you're a total
bubble head picking mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm filming like an idiot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Merl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, you're the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the flush here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these are yellowfoot chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little flush here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All up here, there's a nice little flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are just starting to pop out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these are decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we found some decent ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are some decent size chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much bigger than the babies we've been
picking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I've been here before and we
want to pick these out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that, Bricks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a really nice chanterelle flush.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some big ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy in particular is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Alice in Wonderland.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He pulled me in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredible that the forest just gives
these gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little treasures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little treasures is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we cut it all down?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we cut it all down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're stepping on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you just stepped on a little small
flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little small flush.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're goldy here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, unless we find something different,
I think we're going to finish up here and
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to head over to a little grow,
have a dab, check out some plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining us at this part of the
adventure and we'll see you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're past.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a bolette right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Admiral Bolette.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad they're first bolettes that we
found today, but they're a little past
[SPEAKER_03]: due.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found some pretty good size ones as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up near White Lake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too far from Cypress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too dark on the stem either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're into a gold flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I mean, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and the first time I ever came here,
I saw like, like hundreds of times this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it didn't matter how many
people were around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how Brexton walks right through
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just found a big flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is an amazing flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: This almost looked like psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are in the yellow flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if you guys caught that or if
my camera broke, but there are a ton of
[SPEAKER_03]: yellow foots all in around this tree on
both sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge flushes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like really a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could, we could be here for hours
picking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to pick a bunch of these
and talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Merlin, you found something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Chanterelles, the big ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the bigger Chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chanterelles, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wavy sides, tight ribs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Careful, Brexton.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is like stone.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little, a little root that it was
attached to.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe we should keep an eye out for
some of those in
[SPEAKER_03]: this little zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you found.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mushrooms are such a hoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are such an absolute trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're kind of, well, cause we also
said, let's go now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what always happens when you're
good is you start finding more things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're heading out anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we see anything else of interest,
we will be sure to share with the
[SPEAKER_03]: audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this big red belted polypore conk.
[SPEAKER_03]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the red belted polypores.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Picked some lovely yellow foots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a couple of golds.
[SPEAKER_03]: No stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: After a half an hour of walking and not
seeing anything though, it's funny how you
[SPEAKER_03]: feel, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But mushrooms sometimes require a little
bit of a commitment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I give up when I find them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get off your phone and you focus on
the forest floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you give up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think I might've found something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's what we want.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's like what you picked earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just realized that look at how close
I parked to some Amanitas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they've been nibbled on and there's
some new ones coming out, but that goes to
[SPEAKER_03]: show you the power of the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I drove down this street and just randomly
pulled over right here and there's Amanita
[SPEAKER_03]: muscaria mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to head over to the grow now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's keep this adventure going.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: First things first, apologies for the red
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Method seven has even gifted me the clips
that go over my camera and I've totally
[SPEAKER_03]: spaced them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't bring the right shade,
so everything's going to be an orange and
[SPEAKER_03]: green, unfortunately, but take us through
your little grow here, Merle.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are some pinkies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some Tom Ford pink fish growing
here and week four of the bench about to
[SPEAKER_01]: flip over and float.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we're testing out a few new strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some Hulk right here,
Bruce Banner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some London dosie, or no,
this is London dosie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are Hulk as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are Boscotti right here,
which is a gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have Banana Runts right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's a Banana Runts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny how they look almost stretchy
with through the name Runts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one here seems like the better
phenome of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, does that have a nice smell,
dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, you can pick up a bit of that banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you really can, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one seems like the strongest phenome
and the really tightest nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm phenome hunting right now,
so I'm going to pick out which one is the
[SPEAKER_01]: best.
[SPEAKER_01]: All here are these short, bushy,
London dosie vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got fifth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cookies, what was the kind that you
gave me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Animal cookies right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, what's the other one that you gave
me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Columbian crossed with cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Columbian right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Black Columbian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got some House trained right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some Pure Michigan over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you have a lot of different things
here for how even and nice this canopy
[SPEAKER_03]: looks?
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not look like you're growing like
a shit ton of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, we're just really trying to
pull them all down with these nets and
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that there's a head in every single
square.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really been the key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I wish I could get rid of this orange
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry especially because Method 7
has gifted me the clip that goes over the
[SPEAKER_03]: camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go over here, it's probably going
to be a no-no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have some people talking shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let them talk shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to see the flowers, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get to the other side and
I'll turn the actual light on.
[SPEAKER_03]: These would be like green buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: These buds look great, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, these ones are looking really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I'm going to need my flashlight to
kind of let this... Look how fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: monstrous these things are, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are really slowly, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many tops in here that
they're just toppling onto each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are nice, nice, nice nuggets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this bad boy right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrible light, but beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, when the light is on, you can see how
great they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fat stacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could come back at night if you want to
do the video for it before I cut it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this all?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all Concorde pink.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a big fat kush pinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all starting to go nice and purple
now, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at these donkey dinks hanging off the
fucking... They're all pointing down,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're just so heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see I have two layers of straw,
but they're still falling.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, give that lens a little bit of
a wipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the best light in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do apologize, but it looks nice,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better to show than not, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuckin' A, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun to grow meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should go hit a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like pumping out on the edges
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it when it does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're golf ballers, turning into tennis
balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has really been our technique of
holding them apart with the Scrogs and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting like... A lot of them have like
10, 14 heads on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a nice crystal content.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is crystal-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Juiced up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already in... We're gonna have to
flush all this, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first section I did,
and I don't know if you can see how many
[SPEAKER_01]: tops are in that section.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have like 16 monster heads on
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say, this is probably the first
grow I've ever toured with like my
[SPEAKER_03]: flashlight on my camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice crystal-y content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super fun day picking mushrooms with
Merlin, checking out his grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is going to end up producing a really
nice meal with those mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm hoping I can be there so we can
finish off the video with actually the
[SPEAKER_03]: food that we prepare with these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we're at the point where we
need to dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is inspiring me to dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your trichome forest has inspired me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get dabbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's dab it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab a doodle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you open the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spinning.
Spinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the canopy is pretty nice and even
right now, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gotten... We've picked the
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've...
[SPEAKER_03]: Walked through the woods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Walked through the woods.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've checked out the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's time for a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a joint, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that you're always rolling a joint
while I'm making a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you guys enjoyed this little
squamish adventure that we've been on
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're probably doing some more of these
mushroom picking adventures.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of foraging and then
having Merlin make a really nice meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that meal... Give him a lowdown on
what that meal was yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five course dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the five course dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first course.
[SPEAKER_01]: First course was... That was a bruschetta
with balsamic reduction with maple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we did a beet tartare with avocados
and roasted pine nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That beet tartare was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also had a toasted sourdough with the
beet tartare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toasted sourdough, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did...
[SPEAKER_01]: We did pan seared scallops with a
butternut squash celery root puree with a
[SPEAKER_01]: barbeque.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did... That shit was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Micro greens with it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did a wild mushroom,
chanterelle mushroom risotto with oysters
[SPEAKER_01]: as well with roasted trumpets on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The puree one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you have like pomegranate seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, we did have pomegranate seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pomegranate seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the beautiful thing about this is,
which you probably noticed by now,
[SPEAKER_03]: is as we were talking about it,
I took photos of all that stuff yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just edited them into the video and
you've just seen these beautiful pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see the caliber of what we're
working with here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I expect nothing less from the
chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they'll be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some good ideas for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Rickson?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Concentrated X for the
strawberry banana hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to DNA for the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to JP for the carb cap and the
Terp Slurper banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Dustin Revere for the water
droplet pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And jeez, you could just shout out a lot
of people just to take a dab, couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to DNA for the dimodium pearl in
the bottom of my banger here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit smells so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost like a cold start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a little bit more juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole different experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice cap off to the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big fan of the Terp Slurper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like right around now, my music's
going to be chiming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not because I really want to make
sure that I catch a little bit of what he
[SPEAKER_03]: makes with those mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of the end of the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in reality, you should see one more
final scene, if we have our shit together,
[SPEAKER_03]: where you'll see some of these mushrooms
prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for tuning in, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me, Marlon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out, everybody.
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for having me.
