[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear you mumbling and everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that wasn't Rob mumbling.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was me mumbling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam, this is great stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Howdy, Todd.
[SPEAKER_04]: Howdy, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just hearing a little bit about
the Karma Cup, a big event happening in
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada, a little competition, and Sarah
was just telling us how there was 100
[SPEAKER_03]: entries, and she's giving them two weeks
to judge.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_10]: Two weeks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hearing about so much of this in the news
these days, especially in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_08]: around Denver, that they're finding
pesticides, particularly in concentrate,
[SPEAKER_08]: because again, if it's on the plant and
it's going to be concentrated,
[SPEAKER_08]: it'll be in concentrated form in the
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly, like some of these
products, might be safe for use with food
[SPEAKER_08]: products where it's going to be washed
off.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if the cannabis is never washed,
and if it's just concentrated,
[SPEAKER_08]: and God only knows what happens at nail
temperature to some of these things like
[SPEAKER_08]: Eagle, I'm absolutely convinced it's going
to thermally degrade and give off cyanide.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that that's a known
phenomena, and I think that these are
[SPEAKER_08]: things that we really have to concern
ourselves with in the industry,
[SPEAKER_08]: because what I was asking you more was
policy on pesticide use as opposed to
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticide testing, because I guess the
notion is that they've always been used.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that we're testing for them,
we're finding them, the figure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if your grower knows and is aware of
them and rejects them, because you can
[SPEAKER_13]: actually have a science to prove it,
that's your best asset, just to sit back
[SPEAKER_13]: and say, yeah, let's kind of hope.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, like I said, you really have to put up
the money, you have to research,
[SPEAKER_13]: you have to actually really push your
laboratory to really get up to those
[SPEAKER_13]: standards, because most laboratories out
there are only doing the THC testing,
[SPEAKER_13]: and the biggest problem that we have is
we're dealing in an agricultural state,
[SPEAKER_13]: so we have to deal with all kinds of
situations.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's all about making sure that that
spectral analysis is available to your
[SPEAKER_13]: laboratory and that your laboratory is
actually going to go there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Rob.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is absolutely a huge issue,
that ATN Mark, hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: In California especially, but anywhere
where cannabis is being overproduced.
[SPEAKER_07]: ATN Mark, do either of you have data
showing different pesticide levels and
[SPEAKER_07]: samples?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not interested in the name of the guy
who submitted the sample or what the
[SPEAKER_07]: variety was or anything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd just be interested in seeing the
occurrence and levels of different
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides and samples that have been
collected anywhere, in any state.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can get some of those for you and I'll
bring them next week to Ash Church so I
[SPEAKER_13]: can show you, or if you'd like I can email
you some.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was just trying from the Denver
Post article by Richard Baca that
[SPEAKER_08]: described the Mahatma extracts that had to
be pulled off the shelves after they found
[SPEAKER_08]: out after they were already out on the
shelves that they had unacceptable levels
[SPEAKER_08]: of, I think, different pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there's a list of forbidden
ones and certainly I think you can use
[SPEAKER_08]: integrated pest management in a way that
you're not actually applying these harmful
[SPEAKER_08]: chemicals to your flowers that you're
going to be selling, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, and basically the agricultural
chemicals that are approved for integrated
[SPEAKER_07]: pest management are not harmful to the
beneficials and fairly lightweight in
[SPEAKER_07]: general, but certainly not harmful to
mammals.
[SPEAKER_07]: The big issue to me is that, at least in
the state of California, you have no
[SPEAKER_07]: control whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have advice from the state government
to farmers, normal farmers, through farm
[SPEAKER_07]: bureaus and through farm and feed shops
and places where they give you advice and
[SPEAKER_07]: they ask you what you're going to use it
for and if you're going to use it for the
[SPEAKER_07]: wrong thing they suggest that you not do
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fairly informal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really a police state in
California about pesticides, but they come
[SPEAKER_07]: with some horse sense, normally.
[SPEAKER_07]: The grow room supply shops are run like
mom and pop pet stores.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nobody telling them what to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: They get illicitly packaged avid and
fluoramide and all these things that,
[SPEAKER_07]: let me tell you, in the Netherlands,
you can't buy these without a spray
[SPEAKER_07]: permit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't store them without lock and key.
[SPEAKER_07]: These things are deadly poisonous.
[SPEAKER_09]: That said, when they tested the coffee
shops here, 54% had pesticides or
[SPEAKER_09]: fungicides.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even here in the Netherlands, can you hear
that?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we reached out to an
agricultural university and found that
[SPEAKER_13]: these guys were already doing that
testing.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why it was a natural step for us to
actually reach out and grab them and bring
[SPEAKER_13]: them into the discussion because they
already had the spectral analysis.
[SPEAKER_13]: If anybody is thinking about doing this,
I highly recommend in your local state to
[SPEAKER_13]: reach out to your agricultural university.
[SPEAKER_13]: They usually have a lot of that
information or have access or would know
[SPEAKER_13]: who would.
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I correct, Rob?
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a state issue rather than a federal
one as far as I understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we need to be, of course,
is self-policing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be not too rude and say that I
think it's happening everywhere cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: is being grown commercially.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody that starts investing
money into equipment and time and plants
[SPEAKER_04]: and then starts seeing bugs and problems,
this is the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have good policing in our own
industry and we see this happening
[SPEAKER_04]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's a California thing or a
Colorado thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always speak about California because
that's where I'm from and that's where I
[SPEAKER_07]: visit the most.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something we need to take care of
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more and more we grow, it's a
self-fulfilling problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more and more you grow, the lower and
lower the price.
[SPEAKER_07]: The lower and lower the price,
the less you can afford to toss a crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in the good old days when it was
4,000 a pound and you had a crop that went
[SPEAKER_07]: bad and you only sold it to your buddies,
you pitched it in the trash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you dry it and you make the HO out of
it after you've sprayed it because you
[SPEAKER_07]: were afraid to lose it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two sides to that though.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me throw this out just to be
devil's advocate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a quasi-legal market in
Amsterdam for 30 years since 1984,
[SPEAKER_04]: 1985, really going back even further,
but since the mid-80s, coffee shops have
[SPEAKER_04]: been selling out the front door in tax and
it has done nothing to clean up the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry in Holland at all when it comes
to pesticide use, fungicides, and things
[SPEAKER_04]: that are bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's because they don't have a market
that actually pushes and tests it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, as far as I know, Berkeley is
the only city in the United States that
[SPEAKER_13]: actually makes sure that you actually test
everything before it hits the floor.
[SPEAKER_13]: It can't have something like Mahatma
happen where it comes back positive after
[SPEAKER_13]: the fact, after it's hit the floor.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of education and a lot of work still
needs to happen, even in regulated
[SPEAKER_13]: societies.
[SPEAKER_13]: Going back to, Mark, what you were saying,
at least they're using it.
[SPEAKER_13]: At least they're finding these things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Science is being used.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are finding these things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Before, that wouldn't have been an issue.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to self-police.
[SPEAKER_13]: I get to quietly return it to somebody I
don't get to publicly humiliate them
[SPEAKER_13]: through the media and say, blah,
I did this and blah, I did that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a whole other industry regulation.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, Todd, you wish had happened in
the Netherlands so that everybody was held
[SPEAKER_13]: to a standard so they couldn't skirt the
illegalities because they're growing in
[SPEAKER_13]: small conditions wherever they can,
however they can, whenever they can.
[SPEAKER_13]: Growing medical cannabis, as I say,
growing cannabis is easy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Growing medical grade cannabis is hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: Growing medical grade cannabis
consistently is an art.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to make it into that big of a
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people produce food all the time
that's organic, falls under organic
[SPEAKER_04]: standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it can be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't personally understand what
cannabis, other than prohibition,
[SPEAKER_04]: costs more than tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They flower in about the same time,
don't they, Rob?
[SPEAKER_04]: How long does it take for a tomato to
fully form on the vine?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot easier to grow cannabis than it
is to grow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be able to get a little bit more
weight of tomatoes in a given area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you might get more tomatoes in a
given area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but they get blossom end rot.
[SPEAKER_07]: They get all kinds of problems.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're really a pain in the butt to grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't get a lot for tea, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, but you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember in Lugano when Breeder Steve
had his tents and these tunnels and he
[SPEAKER_03]: rented them from a tomato farmer who had
tomatoes growing next to Steve's sweet
[SPEAKER_03]: tooth and all these beautiful strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the guy found out what Steve was
getting per kilo, he almost fell over.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just couldn't even wrap his head around
ever getting that much for his tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: When commercial growers get ahold of
cannabis, when it's not a gray area thing
[SPEAKER_07]: anymore, but it all settles out,
you'll be surprised how inexpensive it'll
[SPEAKER_07]: be to grow a kind, but it's just another
agricultural product at that point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, true enough.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more work than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good old cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob and Sam, what are you guys puffing on
right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some BHOE stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's it supposed to be made from?
[SPEAKER_06]: Candy tush or something?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's candy tush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it focus that close?
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of not.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we can see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiny piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know me and BHO.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you smoking on, Rob?
[SPEAKER_07]: I just actually haven't been smoking much
anything the last few weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in Turkey.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I got back here, it's been sort of
the same old stuff, but I was in Turkey
[SPEAKER_07]: where I don't smoke at all for the sake of
caution and staying out of jail and all
[SPEAKER_07]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Self preservation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_13]: We've all seen that prison movie about
Turkey.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Midnight Express.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a classic.
[SPEAKER_04]: The scariest fucking movie I've seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scariest movie of my childhood,
that movie right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was probably the first thing I
ever saw about Turkey.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was rough.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, when I saw they'll stab you from the
waist down and it's legal.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, I don't think I'm going to
Turkey.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's actually a wonderful place.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just did a 15-day road trip with two
really nice ladies and went to lots of
[SPEAKER_07]: villages and talked to lots of old ladies
about what they used to do or what their
[SPEAKER_07]: mothers used to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Weavers, rope makers, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tracking down the history of that
particular area's hemp and other textile
[SPEAKER_03]: history?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, actually, it's all about hemp,
but the history there basically boils down
[SPEAKER_07]: to rope makers who were making nautical
ropes for well, since the 15th century,
[SPEAKER_07]: Ottoman naval stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they still made these kind of ropes up
until just a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now the whole thing's kind of come to
an end.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the rope making was the last vestige
of what was going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Women haven't really woven grain sacks and
rugs and things for about 40, 50 years in
[SPEAKER_07]: most places.
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that Turkish-grown hemp?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of it was grown right in the neighbor.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the hemp for the weavings and
things was grown right in the women's
[SPEAKER_07]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did it right close to home and close
to a water source, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of it was grown even closer to home
than a lot of the food.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's rope-a-joke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same land race they're used for
hemp and also was, back in the day,
[SPEAKER_07]: used for hashish.
[SPEAKER_07]: There weren't varieties for one or the
other, as I might have assumed.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it wasn't like a Manchurian strain,
per se?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and it wasn't like in Nepal.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was more like in Nepal,
where they used the same variety for
[SPEAKER_07]: rubbing hashish, but they'd also get seeds
and make texels out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really strong stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not specifically selected for being
really strong dope, in most cases.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have been in certain areas where
they made hashish and were legendary for
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some part of Turkey unknown today.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you clean hash, it was probably
smokable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, when they threshed out the
seeds, they kept the powder, and that was
[SPEAKER_07]: what they ended up having.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many of the plants like Nepal were
dual-use, industrial and hashish?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many regions, I should say,
were dual-use plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was like that in Turkey,
as I suspect, that would be the only other
[SPEAKER_07]: place besides Nepal where I know of three
uses of drugs, seed and fiber,
[SPEAKER_07]: all three taken from the same standing
crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the same thing grown three different
ways, but taken from the same crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: For seed and fiber, of course,
that's really common.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for crossing over to the drug side,
that's rare.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I would assume that back in the day,
since subsistence farmers even today waste
[SPEAKER_07]: absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: His produce of their daily lives,
that they used plants, cannabis crops,
[SPEAKER_07]: all three ways, if they were interested in
the drug side.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was some THC in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there was some THC in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The European hemp varieties we know today
are abnormally low in THC because they've
[SPEAKER_07]: been bred to be that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's part of the deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not very strong sativas to begin
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows what the... We'll find out,
maybe, from the Phylos Project,
[SPEAKER_07]: what Turkish varieties are.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're Afghan hybrids with something,
or Indian hybrids with European.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they're really an Indica sativa
hybrid to be one of the only sure ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I have a stupid question.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sativas, or industrial Indo-European
hemp varieties that came over to North
[SPEAKER_04]: America that we find in Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stuff that made the canvas for the
covered wagons that went west.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this stuff, it was never bred to be low
THC, per se, correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: Back hundreds of years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I'm talking about the modern French
and Hungarian and other varieties that
[SPEAKER_07]: have had to satisfy the EU regulations of
being below 2%, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Todd, you got mute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mic, Rob is reverberating through
your mic very badly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you turn mine off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Todd.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, my question is, is the Indo-European
hemp varieties around the time of
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbus, those stuff that came over to
America, 1500s, 1600s, even 1700s,
[SPEAKER_04]: there wasn't a cotton gin until 1791.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all this stuff was never bred for its
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pre-EU standards, the THC content was
never a conversation in picking for
[SPEAKER_04]: sativas, as we call them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, my dumb question is, why is a lot of
the feral hemp in Nebraska bunkweed?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, from my understanding,
before Rob starts here, the Manchurian
[SPEAKER_13]: strain that was grown was a very just tall
lanky because hemp is grown 300 to 400
[SPEAKER_13]: seed per square meter.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're talking about a very densely-blown
plant as opposed to the drug varietal,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is grown, given usually a little
more space.
[SPEAKER_13]: For some reason, I'm not sure why
genetically it went the way that it did,
[SPEAKER_13]: but most of what is out there,
feral, has just grown so tight and so
[SPEAKER_13]: densely.
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as I know, it's a Manchurian strain
originally, Rob.
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to unmute yourself, Rob.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about it being a Manchurian
strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were plenty of Chinese varieties
that were brought into the North American
[SPEAKER_07]: hemp gene pool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those, in fact, back to what Todd was
saying first.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you see escaped in the Midwest is one
of either two things.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's either European hemp that came here
and was sativa, European sativa,
[SPEAKER_07]: what's called narrow-leafed hemp
varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were the basic colonial cannabis,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_07]: After that came breeding experiments,
not to lower THC content, but certainly
[SPEAKER_07]: using plants that had a low drug content.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those came from China.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what really led to Kentucky hemp,
for instance, which is a Chinese-European
[SPEAKER_07]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't know about THC until 1964.
[SPEAKER_08]: How could they breed THC out?
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't even described in the chemical
literature.
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't breed.
[SPEAKER_09]: They started with gene pools.
[SPEAKER_07]: They started with gene pools.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gene pools that lacked THC to begin with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether they were Chinese gene pools or
they were European gene pools,
[SPEAKER_07]: they were not selected for high THC
content by drug cultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have said, instead of THC,
I could have said psychoactive effect
[SPEAKER_04]: easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never really took that into
consideration when they were breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties that they would later use for
sales, or for ropes, or for paints and
[SPEAKER_04]: varnishes, or for clothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just wondering if growing it
industrial meant that the stuff turned
[SPEAKER_04]: into a lower cannabinoid level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Naturally, I don't think that spacing like
A.T.
[SPEAKER_04]: and inferred has anything to do with the
chemical level of the flower at the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: the growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: Napoli hemp crops are grown hemp seed and
drug crops are grown in very narrow
[SPEAKER_07]: spacing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so they can get the hemp stalks
that they need for the textiles.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they grew them farther apart,
the fiber would be useless.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's part of growing them for all three
crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: The same thing would hold in Turkey if
that's the way they did it, which I think
[SPEAKER_07]: they probably did back in the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not for tea crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, were those crops self-seeded from the
harvesting and making a mess, or did they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually pick a plant and then hold those
seeds and then try to replant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it all self-seeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's kind of why I thought the
more the tall, thin plants succeed,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more that seed gets spread back to the
soil, and year after year, tall,
[SPEAKER_01]: thinner plants become the entire crop,
and that would be a form of breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, there's various unconscious
selection, if you will, even if that's
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe not the correct term, but people
aren't directly being plant breeders and
[SPEAKER_07]: picking one apparent.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're applying all kinds of different
selective pressures to the crop as a
[SPEAKER_07]: whole, to the populations.
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends on what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: To answer your question, if people are
collecting seeds from tall, skinny plants
[SPEAKER_07]: and shaking the seeds out and collecting
the powder, that kind of selection is
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe not so important.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've batched together pretty much the
entire crop, except the males,
[SPEAKER_07]: which died by that point if they haven't
been taken out and used for fiber.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're, for instance, growing them for
rope use, as I just saw, the way those
[SPEAKER_07]: farmers did it is they would go after
they'd taken the hemp in August,
[SPEAKER_07]: before it's really flowered much,
when all the stalks have a good fiber
[SPEAKER_07]: content and they can work the whole crop
as one uniform batch, they take those
[SPEAKER_07]: plants, they're pre-flowering,
and around the edge of the field where
[SPEAKER_07]: plants have a few branches anyway,
they leave those plants for seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how Hmong growers in Southeast
Asia do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's how the Koreans used to do it,
probably how lots and lots of groups did
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd take the fiber first, then they'd
get the seeds later.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're not people who also use the
plants for drug use.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's this third factor you're throwing
in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in that case, in the case of these rope
growers, when I asked them in Turkey,
[SPEAKER_07]: they said, yeah, we'd go back in in
September and we'd pull out all the plants
[SPEAKER_07]: we didn't want and we'd leave the ones
that were the biggest and the greenest,
[SPEAKER_07]: they said.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are the ones that are yielding
the most seed and the ones that are still
[SPEAKER_07]: vigorous late in the year and maybe even
later maturing than ones that have started
[SPEAKER_07]: to pass away.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it depends on what they're
growing it for, which selective pressures
[SPEAKER_07]: would be important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know of so many harvesting practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the knife you use happens to create
a certain vibration that spreads the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: in a good pattern so that they're
reseeding their crop as they're harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking of all the different uses
that could go into naturally driving the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in one direction or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, if everyone's harvesting
early, there are no seeds to self hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground after harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would make a big difference what
they're using to pretty much perpetuate on
[SPEAKER_01]: their crop than someone who's harvesting
and shaking the plant and always losing a
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, don't they want to harvest the seed
for the seed oil?
[SPEAKER_08]: I would only assume that you're going to
want to grab as much of that seed oil as
[SPEAKER_08]: you possibly can and the seed protein,
the seed is really the golden nugget in
[SPEAKER_08]: the crop, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, even if they're only going to resew
the seeds, it's still an outcome that they
[SPEAKER_07]: need.
[SPEAKER_07]: The seeds are precious.
[SPEAKER_07]: The concept that they go back on the
ground and there's volunteers that come up
[SPEAKER_07]: unselected by the farmer, that's probably
not likely.
[SPEAKER_07]: They rotation planted hemp, at least in
Turkey, and they did in most places too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great soil conditioner.
[SPEAKER_08]: A much more economic source of protein
than is soybean.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at the life cycle analysis
between soybean and hemp, hemp seed wins
[SPEAKER_08]: hands down.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a matter of time before that
really makes the way to process foods
[SPEAKER_08]: worldwide as the source of protein because
it's cheaper than soybean and more
[SPEAKER_08]: abundant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, more on farm health too because
it has the higher of the polyunsaturation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's good food.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not however really the emphasis
where I just was.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never found anybody who made hemp seed
oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did eat the seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: They never went to waste, but they
basically just parched them usually along
[SPEAKER_07]: with barley and ate them as a snack.
[SPEAKER_07]: They still do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not tragically enough though, they don't
grow the hemp seeds very much in Turkey
[SPEAKER_07]: anymore if at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have them in the markets,
but they import them from, as the traders
[SPEAKER_07]: thought, they come by ship.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think from India or Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: India basically is the market corner.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes mostly, I found very surprisingly,
into animal feed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it's a very cheap source of protein
that they can use to supplement alfalfa
[SPEAKER_08]: and oats that are basically fed to animals
for animal husbandry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know where they grow these seed
crops in India?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering that when they were
telling me this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's mostly in the moderate
equatorial region.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Punjab region of India is one of the
classical agricultural areas where I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: absolutely certain that, again,
there's just wild all around on the
[SPEAKER_08]: roadside, Rob, just as you're driving
through the countryside.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just growing everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty small seeds, most of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not even as big as the local seeds,
which was kind of interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be a relatively wild snub.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it implies usually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bigger than more of the hand of man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the varieties that they're
actually intentionally farming for oil and
[SPEAKER_08]: for seed purpose, for seed flour,
again, is a much different variety than
[SPEAKER_08]: what's growing wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would assume so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of sad that the cultural
momentum to eat hemp seeds is still there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still buy them in the markets,
big bags of them, but they can't grow
[SPEAKER_07]: their own conveniently or economically or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even illegal to grow hemp seeds
or hemp in Turkey.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just takes a lesson to tell them what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something's got to change.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually a convenient point to
bring up what I saw from Lyon Loughlin's
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter post this week, which is he's a
hemp farmer in Colorado who's grown a crop
[SPEAKER_08]: that apparently analyzes at .5%,
and the state is telling him that they
[SPEAKER_08]: need to dispose of this crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can't be used commercially because of
its analyzing at .5 and not .3,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is the arbitrary cutoff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely fucking ridiculous to have to
throw away an entire crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, the margin of error in making an
HPLC measurement depends on how the sample
[SPEAKER_08]: is handled and how it's dried.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, anybody who's ever done any
testing on a plant will tell you that the
[SPEAKER_08]: top will analyze very different than the
bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: These state testers are basically going
after the tops of the plant that have the
[SPEAKER_08]: highest resin content.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, they're finding slightly out of
spec, higher THCA content than allowed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the crop is officially deemed
marijuana and not hemp anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always been my frustration with them
relying on the French EU seed with that
[SPEAKER_13]: arbitrary number because it is exactly
that arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct me if I'm wrong, Rob, but we found
when we actually started doing experiments
[SPEAKER_13]: with hemp, we found even high grade
cannabis can make some really nice hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it depends on when you're trying to
make hemp, it depends on how you're
[SPEAKER_07]: growing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's back to that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_07]: THC content, but it is going to make tall,
skinny stems if that's what you want to
[SPEAKER_07]: do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one, had a higher fiber content
than many industrial varieties when tested
[SPEAKER_09]: by Dr. Bocha.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd say Dr. Bocha's.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just seems so arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, you could certainly take many,
many different samples and still not have
[SPEAKER_08]: an accurate statistical representation of
the actual THC content of the entire
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the notion is that the tops are out of
spec, well, what if he just whacks off the
[SPEAKER_08]: tops and just uses the bottom for fiber?
[SPEAKER_07]: Here in Europe, that's exactly what they
have to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's batch testing and they have to take
parts of all our samples from different
[SPEAKER_07]: parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not approaching it by taking a
flower sample like it was drugs and
[SPEAKER_07]: looking for the stoniest part.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the way it's done here.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've adopted the 0.3 EU standard,
former EU standard.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now 0.2, but they didn't seem to have
adopted the sampling protocol to back it
[SPEAKER_07]: up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's how this should be challenged
by whoever's got this crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, what's the measurement system that
they're using?
[SPEAKER_08]: They're using the HPLC method as described
in the AHP monograph for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that... The analysis protocol is also
in the EU regulations if they want to look
[SPEAKER_07]: it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what they...
[SPEAKER_07]: It's GC, I'm pretty sure, but it's in
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: What variety of hemp did they grow at this
point?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could actually look into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually texting with Ryan earlier
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could actually send him a text and ask.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because some varieties traditionally
have problems and other varieties never
[SPEAKER_09]: have problems.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it grown since... Was it grown seeded
or was it grown since...
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really want to comment because,
first of all, it's not my... I could make
[SPEAKER_08]: inquiries into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was grown since EMEA, that alone
could have knocked it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking too that also the
extraction method that they're using to
[SPEAKER_08]: analyze the sample can also affect the
results.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you think about it, you're talking
about...
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 tenths of a percent difference between
0.5 and 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could mishandle a sample and knock it
out of spec.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they run that five times?
[SPEAKER_08]: Were the five replicates all within the
statistical margin of error?
[SPEAKER_08]: All of this data has to be... You can't
just say that that crop has got 0.5% burn
[SPEAKER_08]: to crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's bullshit because, again,
even if you just look at moisture and how
[SPEAKER_08]: that sample is handled in terms of how
it's analyzed, is it the dried crop at
[SPEAKER_08]: 0.3% and is it THCA or is it THC?
[SPEAKER_08]: These are all going to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to look into this.
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're smart, he'll have the analysis
done by GC because they're always a little
[SPEAKER_09]: bit lower than an HPLC.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem with GC is that GC,
you're sending it through a thermal
[SPEAKER_08]: injection port, 200 degrees and that
changes everything, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't raise the THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: It lowers the THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's his problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just never fucked around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We stuck with the Zola Tenosha.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit was like 0.01% and every time
the lab tested it, they were just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our whole country... My thing is this
though, is if we're not... Ironically,
[SPEAKER_04]: now we are actually harvesting
cannabinoids from hemp because of the CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: craze, call it what you will, but I always
found it a little odd that we were having
[SPEAKER_04]: a cannabinoid conversation when we were
really harvesting seeds and fibers and
[SPEAKER_04]: cellulose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think now maybe with legalization,
in Colorado, Oregon, now can we grow hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties that are not cannabinoid
limited, but maybe the best expressions
[SPEAKER_04]: that could grow in that area.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really my question, as we lose Rob,
of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to mention something I think
that Chris put as a message here,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is that I've heard from hemp farmers
in Colorado that time of day when those
[SPEAKER_08]: are harvested, absolutely looking at the
profile of the plant during the end of
[SPEAKER_08]: flowering, it's absolutely essential to
meet that 0.3 cutoff on high CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely essential.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there's Mickey Mouse making his first
appearance on Hat Church.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that fuck Mickey?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mickey Mouse is an old head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's fuck Mickey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, welcome Tony, and I guess welcome
Brendan Dabbs, who came and left faster
[SPEAKER_03]: than we could say hello, and of course,
welcome to Chris Bennett, who came in
[SPEAKER_03]: while Rob was chatting away.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Rob, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, so Rob, when do you think the first
evidence of cannabis growing for
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive purposes is based on current
archaeological data and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's still, I don't know,
sort of back to that same 2500,
[SPEAKER_07]: 2200 year ago sort of window.
[SPEAKER_07]: 27 maybe?
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuff all moving around in Central Asia,
maybe a bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eastern Europe, oh boy, it's just all that
stuff comes up about that same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about in China?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like from a lot of stuff I've
read, the Chinese distinguish between
[SPEAKER_02]: their initial hemp crop that they were
growing for fiber and seed and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then that of the later, like sithian
hemp they would call it, or fire hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: or what the gushes were using likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that that came in and there
were two different strains there?
[SPEAKER_02]: A drug content plant that came in maybe
via Indo-Europeans, and then there was
[SPEAKER_02]: already an indigenous Chinese industrial
thing, because most of the, even the
[SPEAKER_02]: Chinese psychoactive purposes,
from what we can see in the literature,
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to start around that same time,
unless we put that date of 2700 BC on Shen
[SPEAKER_02]: Nung, which is pre-debate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's allegorical sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's around that same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And later in history, Chinese historians
refer to Western cannabis, Qi Ma.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was probably introduced at some
point.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is later on in time that they're
talking about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, there was a Western influence,
which in their case would have meant that
[SPEAKER_07]: it was introduced at a later time when
they already knew about Da Ma,
[SPEAKER_07]: the other hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about anything about this recent
sithian thing with the gold bowls and cups
[SPEAKER_02]: that were mistakenly reported as bongs in
the press, but were actually preparations
[SPEAKER_02]: for drinking cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they were nice bowls.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we're to follow where they came
from in your dating and things,
[SPEAKER_07]: the assumption would be that they were
from some libation, possibly cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish they were decorated somehow that
was more indicative of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's what I say about most things
that hint at what we're after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's always hard to go by some sort
of symbolic drawing or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want something a little more solid for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Tony and Brendan Dab,
Dablicious, who just came into the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just chatting it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris and Rob talking history.
[SPEAKER_09]: Soon we're going to be fucking talked.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I meant whether the Synthian was
coming from someplace else.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Synthian genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'd have to get the genetics down,
but yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: The green crack god.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question for Rob and Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob and Sam, if you were left with one
genetic, only one genetic, what genetic
[SPEAKER_13]: would you choose?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Donald was going to answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to catch you eating, Rob.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Rob's muted too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me unmute Rob so we can hear him
chewing.
[SPEAKER_07]: See that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually did that by myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody logged me a cell phone last week.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really a scream.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, where are you going to grow this
Synthian?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's you.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's you, Rob.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's you, Rob, and you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you had your choice, wherever you are
in the world, and you grew one strain,
[SPEAKER_13]: and you were left with one strain,
what strain would you choose?
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could grow it outdoors, haze.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, haze.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could grow it, you have one strain,
indoor or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Haze growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I gotta say that I'm damn near
in the same boat with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Haze outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long flowering.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I really think that a universe
where I could only grow one variety would
[SPEAKER_07]: be an absolutely horrible place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hope that never happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: No more fucking haze, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so tired of it after 83 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so tired of haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you imagine how perfect that the
resin and all of the products made from
[SPEAKER_00]: the resin would be?
[SPEAKER_00]: If everyone was working on one strain,
one resin, and there was a Legends of
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash, and everyone was like, well,
I've got the outdoor haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some outdoor haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've all got the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me see your resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would really be competitive to
get that resin nailed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it would all
just still be the same cereal,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd immediately start working on it until
I could get resin at least the size of
[SPEAKER_09]: grapes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why haven't you been working on that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just hasn't gotten very far yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exponential.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll grow the most right in the last
few stages.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'd like to see is somebody really
working on me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be a good choice with a close friend
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But working on really making hashish
varieties, things that aren't necessarily
[SPEAKER_07]: anything like the butt in a bag sort of
model that people have been breeding to
[SPEAKER_07]: for the last 20 years or more.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, just try to breed some different
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Narrowly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Think outside the box a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you guys consider hash strains to be
strains that either produce a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: resin head size consistently, like good
for hash, like this makes a ton of 7 to
[SPEAKER_01]: you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would a hash strain be about robust,
complex terpenes in the experience rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than gearing it towards yields for hash?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, are you talking about today and the
future?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are you talking about traditionally?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because traditionally hash strains were
strains that were made into hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I see people say this is the hash
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I'm not going to get a shit
ton of dry sift off of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it might be the best hash I've ever
had in my life based on the way it looks,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way it smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of why I'm like, well,
look, there's two sides of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is we could just go around smelling
the jars of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be an experience of itself
with never smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of why I'm like, look,
I have a lot of strains that I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this might make great hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, it might just produce a
shit ton of 45U, and that's not good for
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, for instance, that is the
beloved Hayes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has great resin, little tiny glands
with lots of it, kicks your ass,
[SPEAKER_07]: has a great terpene profile, whatever it
takes.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is miserable as far as getting any
kind of a resin yield from it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really disappointing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dry sifting, anything you do with it,
it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you can rub resin from it and get it
to work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or hybrids.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, there's a lot of breeding to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: You really just, of course, want varieties
that have the right terpene profile and
[SPEAKER_07]: just give you whatever effect you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also produce lots of resin that's easy
to get off the plant, no matter how you're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Economics in the end is going to be about
yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the rest of it's going to be icing on
the cake and a little extra vig.
[SPEAKER_07]: But basically, it's going to be how much
you can get.
[SPEAKER_07]: With clean resin for agricultural unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's kind of what I'm afraid of
because I think of my best yielder and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I don't want to fucking smoke grape
crush hybrid just because I can get 20
[SPEAKER_01]: grams of 70U sift out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to smoke blueberry where I get a
gram and a half, and I just look at it and
[SPEAKER_01]: worship it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of why I wanted your
definition of what the future of hash
[SPEAKER_01]: should be.
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest, I don't think you have to
worry because I bet you anything,
[SPEAKER_09]: we could put pretty much any terpene
profile in any established resin variety.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think there's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question in regards to that,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: In regards to when did you guys come
across terpenes as a modulator to the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid profile?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, about 2000, Rob and I, I obtained
some pure THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: 100% pure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we did was we vaporized 25
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_09]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was THCA.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: We vaporized 25 milligrams each in a
volcano on one of those little,
[SPEAKER_09]: they're like a little stainless steel
Brillo pad, those little pads that they
[SPEAKER_09]: have.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we were blown away because I mean
if you smoke 25 milligrams of hash or 25
[SPEAKER_09]: milligrams of, you get stoned and it's
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: But with this, the most describable thing
about it was that it had no individuality
[SPEAKER_09]: whatsoever like cannabis products do.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really flat, one dimensional,
kind of boring.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, I think at the time, actually said,
if this is all there is to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't be a smoker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if this is what you got turned onto
in high school or whatever, instead of the
[SPEAKER_07]: real thing, I don't think any of us would
have really been interested.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of like being a fan of
Everclear, you know, the 180 something
[SPEAKER_07]: proof.
[SPEAKER_07]: Liquor you can get in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even legal in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's ethanol, essentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: And nobody drinks it straight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, nobody just dilutes it
with water and drinks it because they like
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a novelty.
[SPEAKER_07]: And THC was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had no color at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: So later that day, what we did was we
mixed it with a little bit of 50% dry sift
[SPEAKER_09]: skunk resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what that allowed was to create a
material that was 75% THC, so less than
[SPEAKER_09]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was also terpene rich from the
resin, from the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we smoked that, the effects were
twice as strong as the pure THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a light went in our heads because from
the early 70s, both Robert and I,
[SPEAKER_09]: even before we met, had felt that terpenes
might well contribute to the synergistic
[SPEAKER_09]: effects found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the primary reasons was
because haze, when it was tested for its
[SPEAKER_09]: THC level, was to be, you know,
in the high end of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you smoked it, it was in the
outer space of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was really, really active.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that was because of the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's how you felt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the other amazing thing in the early
70s was that people started growing
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: They started growing senesemia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when you really noticed what
the difference was between fresh homegrown
[SPEAKER_07]: and what imported weed of whatever kind
you ever got before, what that was.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it was – that was a profound
difference, you know, just to see
[SPEAKER_07]: something fresh, you know, the way Mother
Nature gives it to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: The essence of most of the weed that you
smoked back in the 70s, a moldy,
[SPEAKER_08]: musty essence, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I remember my first pack of weed,
1974, it was moldy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that I think about it, it certainly
was moldy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think most of what Robert and I got,
even though it was imported, it was not
[SPEAKER_09]: moldy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if it was, it was very, very,
very, very slightly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but a lot of – you can write it in a
lot of ways, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: A general statement that most of
commercial weed at the time, essentially
[SPEAKER_08]: which came from Mexico, was probably
fouled with mold and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_08]: different microbes.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you looked very hard, you would have
found things for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of it, of course, is unsmokable,
as you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just plain right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but – Well, I was a young kid on a
dead tour in the mid-70s.
[SPEAKER_08]: By 1980, I was hooked up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, meanwhile, back to terpene,
so we smoked the pure THC with rice.
[SPEAKER_09]: This ain't it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We smoked THC mixed with resin 50-50,
which made 75% THC by dry weight.
[SPEAKER_09]: And wow, that was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then what we did a year or two later,
we obtained all the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_09]: so the top 10 cannabinoids, THC,
CBD, CBG, THCV, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also obtained the top 10 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we were able to try the different
cannabinoids, and we found out that a
[SPEAKER_09]: couple of interesting things, like number
one, if you smoke pure CBD in a fairly
[SPEAKER_09]: large amount, a tenth of a gram,
100 milligrams, then what happens is it
[SPEAKER_09]: blocks the activity of even the strongest
dry sieved ash for about 8 to 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other interesting thing was that THCV
is not psychoactive at all, because a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: of people at that time believed it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we tried all the different terpenes
with THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we tried 25 milligrams of THC all
double-blinded with one terpene,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, as tiny amount as we could put
it with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we found out was that mersene,
limalene, tionine, and a few other
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely potentiated THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: And most of the others, or a lot of the
others, also modulated THC to different
[SPEAKER_09]: levels.
[SPEAKER_09]: So some made you couch lock, some made you
speedy, and it was like a revolution.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we had suspected it, but we never,
never really dreamed it would be that
[SPEAKER_09]: clear.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we did it with 12 different
double-blinded test subjects with a
[SPEAKER_09]: 100-question survey before and after,
and we all agreed on the same things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Different people preferred the couch lock
or the uplifting, but they all agreed that
[SPEAKER_09]: that particular compound with THC had that
effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this was all maybe 12 years ago or 13
years ago, although we started it
[SPEAKER_09]: practically 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: At first, I was afraid to release the
information, because I thought people
[SPEAKER_09]: would start coming out with, Skunky Sams,
improve your weed spray, turn mold to
[SPEAKER_09]: gold.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have to a certain degree,
but the better side of it is when people
[SPEAKER_09]: are extracting terpenes from the natural
cannabis sources and then adding them back
[SPEAKER_09]: to the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty benign as long as no
chemicals and solvents are being left.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what to say, but the truth of
it is, it's changed cannabis, and our
[SPEAKER_09]: understanding will continue to learn,
but it's a really big step forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'd really like to see done is
something much more sophisticated than we
[SPEAKER_07]: were able to do, and see science put to
bear on this situation and see what we can
[SPEAKER_07]: learn about different terpene combinations
with different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's 140 of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seems the most interesting avenue for me
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just 140 known, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just what we know so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, some of them are really in trace
amounts, and that doesn't mean they're not
[SPEAKER_07]: important, but about 20 of them make up
most of the terpenes in cannabis we smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: today.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a smattering of other
compounds, and they could be key also.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there could be a couple hundred
terpenes, and we just haven't ID'd them
[SPEAKER_09]: yet, but the smaller the amount the less
significant they are likely to be,
[SPEAKER_09]: just by odds.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's probably also heavy selective
pressures involved recently in the way of
[SPEAKER_07]: people breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's aromas people like, and there's
effects they expect based on that aroma.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this feedback loop thing that makes
it all kind of hard to study in a more
[SPEAKER_07]: detailed way.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's important, and those things are
somehow related, but they're not as
[SPEAKER_07]: related in the way I would have thought,
in a biochemical sort of way.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're more related in what we
individually make of each variety and our
[SPEAKER_07]: relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm sounding a bit cosmic for a
scientist guy, but it's impossible to
[SPEAKER_07]: separate one from the other.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even sure exactly how you would do
a statistically rigorous test of the
[SPEAKER_07]: terpene and cannabinoid data.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be interesting for somebody to set it
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot more powerful tools now that
we have had.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are biochemically related.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, but that's not the only
relationship is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always wondered if they're competing
pathways.
[SPEAKER_07]: They use the same precursors, so what
exactly is going on?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hard to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've certainly jacked up both
pathways in the modern, seen some EO
[SPEAKER_07]: varieties, and these hybrids are big
producers of all of the above.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's not like there's a shortage of
one thing or another.
[SPEAKER_07]: The terpenes seem to have become sort of a
mishmash.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more now what plants don't have
rather than what they have, in my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sort of what makes a variety and
what's characteristic in the way it smells
[SPEAKER_07]: to me is a key terpene it has,
or a couple of them, but also all the
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes that it's lacking so that it
doesn't smell like everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty inbred at this point.
[SPEAKER_08]: The spaces between the nodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many distinctly different cannabis
varieties do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were to liken cannabis strains to
colors in the crayon box, how many crayons
[SPEAKER_04]: would be in that box, Rob or Sam?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just a couple basic cannabinoids,
and all the rest of the colors are
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes, or the vast majority of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Figure it out like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's 140 known terpenes, but some of
them are almost just like adding a shimmer
[SPEAKER_09]: rather than a real note.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I put it like this, Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wrote in the introduction of the
Cannabible, there was less than a dozen
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that really ultimately shaped the
whole breeding profile that the 90s and
[SPEAKER_04]: into the 21st century saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess what I'm really asking is how many
different, if you will, original strains
[SPEAKER_04]: are we really passing around?
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed like there isn't that many.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you sit there and we talk about
Hayes, or a Kush, or a Trainwreck,
[SPEAKER_04]: or a Stunk, or a Callio, the list gets
kind of short, is my point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering, obviously, if you guys
had actually collected what we know as
[SPEAKER_04]: modern cannabis, and how wide of a
selection it really is before it gets into
[SPEAKER_04]: just a lot of hybridization.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already gotten into a lot of
hybridization.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already too late, from that point of
view.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are several things that are going on
that are going to allow us to learn more
[SPEAKER_07]: about these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those is the Phyllis Bioscience
Project that I'm involved with,
[SPEAKER_07]: and probably mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_07]: With this project, we're able to,
at this point they've looked at six or
[SPEAKER_07]: seven hundred I don't know, maybe more by
now, basically dispensary samples from six
[SPEAKER_07]: states, a thousand of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've put together a model from this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't let you see it yet, but it comes
down to nodes that seem to be key parts of
[SPEAKER_07]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to explain this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a tree, it's more of a closely
related node.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some varieties are obviously more closely
related to each other than they are to
[SPEAKER_07]: other ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, everything is interrelated.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no little satellite that's not
related to anything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a giant web.
[SPEAKER_07]: That says a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot about where we're at with
varieties these days, and how much
[SPEAKER_07]: reshuffling of the deck is how we've
always referred to the things going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: To refer back to what Bob's talking about
from Jason King's first can of Bible,
[SPEAKER_07]: the introduction I wrote is called What's
in a Name?
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out in 2000, I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is data that came basically from
Sam's seed collection, seed catalog
[SPEAKER_07]: collection, from getting everyone there
was, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also knew at that point all the major
seed company people, major like six
[SPEAKER_07]: companies, so it was easy enough to ask
people, if you didn't say in their
[SPEAKER_07]: catalog, what land races primarily they'd
use to make certain varieties,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then later on which of those varieties
they'd use to make other ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: After that point in time, the business
became much, much larger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, people changed the names for
whatever business reasons they had,
[SPEAKER_07]: but nobody got any mileage anymore of
telling people what was really in them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I published Realizing This is
Happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I published that around that
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since that time, certainly new things have
been brought in that people had that were
[SPEAKER_07]: not released to anybody back in the year
2000.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that's come up much more
recently also.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are new land races occasionally that
people have added in, certainly in the
[SPEAKER_07]: last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically,
[SPEAKER_07]: people operate on clones, so people still
pop new beans and get new materials,
[SPEAKER_07]: and seed industry goes on.
[SPEAKER_07]: But all that stuff basically is highly
interrelated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, when we get to analyzing land races
in the Philos project, then we'll have
[SPEAKER_07]: this cloud, which would be like the canopy
of a tree, if you want to go back to a
[SPEAKER_07]: more standard model of lineage,
and as a family tree.
[SPEAKER_07]: The land races are the predecessors of
everything we have today.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't come from outer space.
[SPEAKER_07]: They came from farmers somewhere,
and not that long ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been able to collect old dead seeds
and leaves from people who still have land
[SPEAKER_07]: races, and things like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be able to get a lot of the
branches of the tree, the smaller branches
[SPEAKER_07]: near this canopy of modern-day varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where it goes from here, evolutionarily,
is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not a good position to be in,
necessarily, for a crop plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it happened to corn, there were
blights that nearly wiped out maize.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can learn more from the Philos project,
if anybody wants to contribute to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not that hard to get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Science is fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'll take this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to ask Todd and Rob a combination
question, because I think it goes back to
[SPEAKER_01]: something like Mark saying, all I got was
bunky, moldy weed when I was a teenager,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I remember the kind of weed I grew up
on as a teenager, as Jamaican import,
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to Mexican import.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you said weed only grow hazes,
is it because of a multitude of factors,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're in the tropics, these terpenes
preserve well, I swear that certain
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, because of the terpenes they
produce, they reject mold, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: more, basically, they are the best strains
for shipping and transport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Todd, you've been in all different
types of situations, but there's a day
[SPEAKER_01]: where you don't want to transport the
stinky, stinky skunk, but were there ever
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that you knew you could stuff in a
bag and it would never go bad,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there were certain genetics that those
terps made that strain good for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll answer first, because I have
less experience than Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that in learning how to handle
your cannabis is key to what happens to it
[SPEAKER_04]: if it gets moldy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately for me, I started growing
cannabis when I was only 13, and I had to
[SPEAKER_04]: dry it in order to smoke it, so I
inherently learned how to dry it and cure
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, anything from toaster ovens to
what eventually ended up just being
[SPEAKER_04]: patient and waiting weeks for it to cool
off and get right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once it was right, it's still a
vegetable product, and if you put it in a
[SPEAKER_04]: baggie or you put it somewhere and you're
not conscious of its humidity,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can cause it to mold up pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: So handling it, to me, is what you're
talking about, Gracia.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no strains, because it depends on
the variety at the time of its moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all of these factors are working into
the conversation, but are there
[SPEAKER_11]: mold-resistant varieties?
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob?
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob is muted.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we unmute Rob?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm muted still.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Try this again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can hear you now, Rob.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are certainly susceptible varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we deal with today with this
modern polyhybrid gene pool that we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the varieties we have now contain at
least a smattering, or actually rather a
[SPEAKER_07]: large percentage, of Afghan background.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the broadleaf drug varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis indica subspecies afghanica,
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these indicas, as people call them,
and they are indeed one indica,
[SPEAKER_07]: are predominant in a lot of the varieties
we have today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they brought us is an extreme
susceptibility to mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Afghanistan's a dry place.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no reason for varieties to develop
a natural resistance to mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just wasn't an issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: So before this time, we have varieties
from Mexico and Jamaica and Colombia and
[SPEAKER_07]: Thailand, and all these were descended
from an Indian gene pool, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: The narrow leaf drug varieties,
the true indica subspecies indica.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they came from semi-tropical and
tropical areas and mountain areas,
[SPEAKER_07]: but places that had a considerable amount
of rain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for them, a natural resistance to
infection by molds is a selective
[SPEAKER_07]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had plants that matured considerably
later than the modern-day hybrids,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they weren't really susceptible to
mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were susceptible to other things,
and if you treated them badly,
[SPEAKER_07]: they could get mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, but you had to treat
them real badly instead of coddling them
[SPEAKER_07]: all the time, and they have mold like
today's varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, again, the genetic background and
historical background for what we see
[SPEAKER_07]: today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it's in everything today,
pretty much, unless you have a variety
[SPEAKER_07]: that's pre-Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the reason why I wonder,
like, I have a bunch of plants in veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I created a condition in which they
got infected with mold from a maple tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I watched as, I'm like, this is,
the plants with the highest, you could
[SPEAKER_01]: say, stem rub terpene production seem to
be the least effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's a genetic trait,
but I'm just looking at the surface area
[SPEAKER_01]: of a plant, a mold, and the types of
terpenes that would be on those micro
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes that are available in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I look up those strains,
I'm like, okay, high in limonene,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know limonene is anti-fungal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that some of that attribute,
where I go over to the next strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this is getting destroyed,
and I rub the stem, and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells like nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying it's a universal quality,
but when I found the weed that smelled the
[SPEAKER_01]: most like my dad's Jamaican compressed
brickweed, it was a very peppery,
[SPEAKER_01]: spicy version of Master Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems that that preservation and
that resistance to conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can press this shit out of it
into a brick, stuff them in a suitcase,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then send it on a boat for three
weeks, it seems to always come back to a
[SPEAKER_01]: peppery terpene or a more sativa,
basically that same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only grow sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know much about indicas,
but the Tuna Kush took a beating.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would suggest that the peppery
taste that's remaining is what's left
[SPEAKER_07]: after the three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even looking for some reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, am I off again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I just can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can hear you, Rob.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not muted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear you, Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit, it was my headphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you'll agree, Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was left over in your dad's Jamaican,
not disrespect intended, but it was what
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't cooked out of it in transit and in
drying and everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what's left.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the commonality of cannabis that we
found in lots of imported things back in
[SPEAKER_07]: the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Different varieties left behind different
characteristic flavors, but it's what we
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't really learn about until we grew
seeds from those, like you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you see the terpenes that didn't get
boiled out in transit or handling or any
[SPEAKER_07]: other processing that ever happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: The sesquiterpene, some of the lower
boiling point ones are what's left in...
[SPEAKER_08]: Beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beta-karyophylline,
 humaline,
karyophylline oxide, yeah, those are the
[SPEAKER_08]: ones usually that give that peppery
essence.
[SPEAKER_09]: We smoked both of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't suggest anybody smoke terpenes
straight.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is akin to solvent abuse.
[SPEAKER_08]: You ever use terpenes to flavor your bong
water?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I've used... What are those things
called?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know kaffir limes?
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaffir limes, they use the leaves in Thai
cooking.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's fruits that grow on these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just happened to have a friend who has
one in their yard.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really limonene rich.
[SPEAKER_07]: These things are just a peel, basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's hardly anything inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing you do with it except chop
it in small pieces and fill your bong with
[SPEAKER_07]: them like putting ice in your bong.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really great thing to do with old
stale wheat.
[SPEAKER_07]: I learned this a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a really good one.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is that terpene enhancer thing,
primarily limonene.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all sweet citrusy stuff in them,
and they work great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sort of.
[SPEAKER_08]: I recently did a couple dabs with my
friend Dave Malone from Green Dot there in
[SPEAKER_08]: Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: He flavored the bong water with a little
bit of lemongrass oil, and it was like a
[SPEAKER_08]: completely different dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: He did a dab before and did a dab after.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting that we're talking about
this, because back in 2003, I opened a
[SPEAKER_03]: gallery in Vancouver called the Melting
Point, and I had a vaporization station.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually called the inhalation
station of vaporization.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was about 20-plus feet long,
and I had a variety of all the different
[SPEAKER_03]: top-quality vaporizers that were available
at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Aromed from Germany, and the Volcano,
and Riptek was there, and the Volitizer
[SPEAKER_03]: was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a whole variety of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was so early, and really there
was only one Compassion Club that existed,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was still very young.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had no real regulations or rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was completely not allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of pushed the boundaries,
and I just said, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let people bring their herbs,
and use these vaporizers, and sit at the
[SPEAKER_03]: table, and set it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, what I did was we acquired other
essential oil-secreting herbs that were
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal, like lavender, and just
different things that were right next door
[SPEAKER_03]: to my store.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had people come in and vape these
different things, and eventually people
[SPEAKER_03]: started bringing in pure essential oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd take the tiniest little minute drop
of mint, and it was the most uplifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't even believe some of these
things were literally giving people the
[SPEAKER_03]: effects of being high, but in a different
way from a completely different plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn near 12 years ago that we were doing
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the old melting point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Romatherapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Mintash.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Romatherapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Romatherapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I was about to say is listening to
myself, blah, about any baloney.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Rob, you were one of the few
researchers that got, you and Dave,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean you and Rob, are the few people
that literally got into the whole cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: It amazes me that more of us in this don't
go the way of what you've done with hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: What caused you to have such a broad look
at cannabis, as opposed to just being into
[SPEAKER_04]: the stuff that gets us high?
[SPEAKER_09]: They were legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a legal hobby.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the travels, well,
takes you to interesting places,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it all started really, I guess,
because of being involved with nature
[SPEAKER_07]: techs and going to China and seeing a hemp
textile mill and then having time off in
[SPEAKER_07]: China.
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew a little bit about hemp things
already from Hungary, things made in
[SPEAKER_07]: villages for people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We collected things there, but it was more
like finding linens.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't too exciting, but still part of
the picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I went on vacations at first to
Yunnan province in China, not where I
[SPEAKER_07]: worked at all, but where there were a lot
of minority ethnic groups.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually saw people wearing things they
said were made from hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was right about the time when some of
the Hmong batik died, indigo batik died,
[SPEAKER_07]: skirts and scraps from them were being
used to make purses and bags and things.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were showing up in the hemp fairs and
things, the early ones of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what piqued my interest to begin
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just never looked back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started finding more and more different
cultures that had used hemp for a long,
[SPEAKER_07]: long time and in different ways,
but primarily through their textiles,
[SPEAKER_07]: through their weaving.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing I'm most interested in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously your career brought you to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone who's picked it up is amazed with
that body of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just utterly fascinated with the
history of cannabis, and no one's ever
[SPEAKER_04]: brought it together quite like you and
Mark do in your latest book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I write books, or I try to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine everybody in the book as
great as that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just wondering how long did it take
you to write?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you come up with cannabis,
evolution, and esnobotany, if you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: mind me asking?
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be almost 20 years ago now,
19 years ago that Mark and I finally met
[SPEAKER_07]: each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark had written his master's dissertation
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was called Man and Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out in 1972, I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: Through that, I wrote in 1976.
[SPEAKER_07]: I came up with my way to get out of
undergraduate education and published my
[SPEAKER_07]: honors thesis, my honors dissertation,
which is called The Botany and Ecology of
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: My inspiration when I went to the library
was writing a Mark's book.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could do it at Santa Barbara,
I could do it at Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_07]: We corresponded ever since and finally met
at a Society for Economic Botany meeting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Economic Botany Society is basically a
group of ethnobotanists.
[SPEAKER_07]: Economic botany is what we used to call
the field before ethnobotany really.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the botany of plants that impinged
on the economics of humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: It became a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It became the study of humans and the
plants they used in those relationships,
[SPEAKER_07]: so all sorts of plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Through that vehicle, if you will,
that investigative tool of ethnobotany,
[SPEAKER_07]: which Mark was already experienced with,
he was 10 years my senior and a professor
[SPEAKER_07]: at the University of Hawaii, teaches this
subject, we decided to do the book.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd already had experience for my graduate
work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had things left from that that I wanted
to publish.
[SPEAKER_07]: We set off on this grand project to write
this book.
[SPEAKER_07]: We figured it'd take a few years,
and we'd publish it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, 17 years later, just a couple years
ago, this month, we finished it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess if we'd known it was going to take
so long, we never would have tackled it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just seems too long at the time,
when you look back at least.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did it, and it just was a growing
project.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably half the 700-plus citations came
to us well after we got started.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them in the last 10 years,
the last half of the project.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just keep getting more and more
information.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to be comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: We wanted to have a reference book
published by Academic Press and University
[SPEAKER_07]: of California Press has done this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people feel it's a credible body
of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like it to have more exposure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark feels the same way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would entertain ideas for getting this
body of knowledge off to more people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a syllabus written around this
book, and is this the book that will be
[SPEAKER_04]: used in colleges when a cannabis course is
offered?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that most naturally, cannabis
evolution and ethnobotany will most
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely be the book that is the
required reading.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this already in practice?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something that you're working on?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see a curriculum built.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see it a lot more simplified
than all the massive information that's in
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a project I'm not actively working
on, but I really would like to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would take an educator.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would take an editor.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would take someone who knows how to
pare down what's there and get the
[SPEAKER_07]: essential bits into a form that appeals to
people today who want to learn,
[SPEAKER_07]: which would largely be online,
I would suspect.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really see much of a future in
trying to write books, except for
[SPEAKER_07]: sentimental reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are still reading, even though
they're not reading, per se, books.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because they're electronically
delivered information, it's still fonts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still words.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still thoughts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shakespeare is Shakespeare is Shakespeare,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're conveying a lot of information,
and people are able to bring it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: More than ever, I would say, please write
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't write less, because contributions
like marijuana botany had a big impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it wasn't for authors like you and Mel
Frank, I would have never, ever cleaned
[SPEAKER_04]: out my closet and started growing cannabis
if I had not found a Mel Frank grow book.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me to stumble upon later your
contribution, marijuana botany,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was amazed at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: These were the pebbles in the river for me
to step on as I walked across and learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you guys would write more,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Truthfully, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even publish it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shorter papers get right to the point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you don't have to go through
publishing houses.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to wait for big books.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, people like you,
like Mel Frank, you have, if you will,
[SPEAKER_04]: a literary following.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are interested in the stuff you're
learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to get it firsthand, because
fortunately, you like me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of the world, too, would benefit
from the work you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's not these huge 350,000 word,
17-year projects, but much shorter
[SPEAKER_04]: projects about the fascinating terpenes
and chemistry and other elements of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis that are all interconnected right
now that we're learning about in society.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everybody's learning right now
through their smart phones.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, the news is coming in every
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm getting at, is some other
way to get information out there,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm hearing it, I'm like,
yeah, a good five page article on that
[SPEAKER_01]: subject of these terpenes, or why would we
pick that strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every different subject we've jumped on is
all a kickass five page article that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could just go in deep on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Sam discovering the terpenes,
then Sam being able to, you guys having
[SPEAKER_01]: access to the THCA.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob was with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you guys doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's say we're looking at me and
Bubble Man, and we're fucking with the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would your article be on when you
discover it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you like to see us do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where would you like to see us go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know where I'm going in exploring the
strain not being the strain by isolating
[SPEAKER_01]: the wet terpenes, the ones that disappear
when they dry, and seeing if they modulate
[SPEAKER_01]: the strain in a whole different profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you guys ever have things like that
where you want to see, like I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: see, would THCA help standardize cannabis
for pain, even if it wasn't exciting for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's lots of interesting things
people can still do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably more than ever, really.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's lots of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_09]: Marcel Delvit at Mary Farm, I think has a
patent for using THCA for most medical
[SPEAKER_09]: applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wouldn't hold up in an infringement
case.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you go ahead and patent it all you
want.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not worth the papers written on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just gave me the go-ahead to keep
using THCA to treat pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't patent anything that's obvious
and true.
[SPEAKER_09]: For dozens of years, what I've been doing
is taking all my THCA dry sift and
[SPEAKER_09]: converting it to THC so that it was not
breaking anybody's patents.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll dab to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't patent something that's known
and obvious.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a use patent.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a medical use patent.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a THCA patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: The use is obvious.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's known.
[SPEAKER_08]: It won't hold up in an infringement court,
a case of infringement against that
[SPEAKER_08]: patent, which is why you don't see them
suing anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a patent lawyer, but he's had it
for quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've worked with a lot of patent lawyers
in the last 25 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a patent lawyer, but I have a lot
of patents.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what it takes to get a patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get a patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't mean that it's going to hold
up in an infringement case.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's definitely true.
[SPEAKER_08]: The best thing you should do is if you
come up with something that's cool rather
[SPEAKER_08]: than patent it, just do what the folks at
Coca-Cola did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep it a trade secret.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep it a secret that only you know about,
and then you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the type of intellectual property
you have in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trade secret.
[SPEAKER_08]: Branding, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: You call a brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you trademark a brand or if you have a
branded trademark, that's also a form of
[SPEAKER_08]: intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting patents, especially just around
cannabis or the constituents of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_08]: you could come up with an end use patent
or come up with something that you think
[SPEAKER_08]: is new and not obvious, but chances are
it's already been demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's already been demonstrated,
it's not novel.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not novel, it can't be an
invention.
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you start working on Hashish?
[SPEAKER_12]: You were here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's after I moved to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_07]: I moved from California and Indiana when I
was in grad school before I moved to
[SPEAKER_07]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I got here, I moved into a Hash
culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that we didn't have Hashish in
California, but here there was a Hashish
[SPEAKER_07]: culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the dominant deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't really have much marijuana to
speak of, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: For people listening, you mentioned when
you were in college, you wrote your paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it called?
[SPEAKER_07]: Botany and Ecology of Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you followed that up with your 1981
release, Marijuana Botany.
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you started working on Hashish?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I moved to Amsterdam in 1987,
I guess it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in line of thinking of this,
what's your next book project?
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, now that cannabis is finished,
you must be working on something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working on another body of cannabis
knowledge, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be coming out as a book
except possibly for sentimental value as a
[SPEAKER_07]: collection.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working on trying to get this Turkish
knowledge together while I have the
[SPEAKER_07]: chance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of publishing something from work
I've done 10 or 20 years ago, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_07]: do it in reverse and publish the most
recent done things first, and then work
[SPEAKER_07]: back through the rest.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all I have done, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a question about Hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you in any way looking to update in
the next two or three years Hashish with
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the breakthroughs that have
occurred in the world of dry sifting,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the world of rosin, these sort of
things that are fairly new that haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: really been written about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's an interesting you'd mention
it because at the moment, the book is
[SPEAKER_07]: sliding out of print, I would say.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's near future, and maybe there was a
bit of a revision a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: but yeah, it's maybe done its time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the new knowledge should be
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it should be written by people who
do what they're doing, not me,
[SPEAKER_07]: secondhand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just personally, that's the way I
see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not just that, but I think
people should write what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they extend information through
YouTube and Instagram, and especially
[SPEAKER_07]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee whiz, how many videos are there of how
to do cool stuff and make Hash?
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the people who are the experts
these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who are in the trenches.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still want to put it in print.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still want to have it in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bitcash, to me, is the greatest
concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the 90 micron, that whole book,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, yeah, we'll do all the
best shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just put it all in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like we need to have the Bible
constantly updated, is all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, books will always have their place,
just like vinyl records.
[SPEAKER_03]: People will always want vinyl.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always going to be people that
love them, and books, they play an
[SPEAKER_03]: important role in the sense that one day,
if some of this digital knowledge is lost
[SPEAKER_03]: or blipped and gone, that books can still
be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I like books, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just frustrated by changes in how
people favor to receive information these
[SPEAKER_07]: days, shall I say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to just be cranky about it
and continue publishing books just because
[SPEAKER_07]: they're cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if I can afford to publish books just
because they're cool, I will do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the moment, I'd sort of like to
get, since I'm not making any money
[SPEAKER_07]: anyway, I'd sort of like to get a little
bang for my not buck and educate a bunch
[SPEAKER_07]: more people to get my drift.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, give it away.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't make any money on that book
anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't foresee making a heap,
no matter if it comes out in paperback.
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter if they make the Kindle a lot
cheaper, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about the Hashish app?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I really respect you saying
that, Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as someone that tries to create
projects like the Culture High or the
[SPEAKER_04]: Union or my first book or any of the
things I've worked on, like The Emperor,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's about transmitting information and
sharing this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't get paid on any of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all a labor of love.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you put 17 years into a book like
Cannabis, there is obviously the only
[SPEAKER_04]: return you can get is the good feeling you
get from sharing it with us all,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is why I'm so enthusiastic about it
and I just feel more doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's a reward so great
that could really reward you for the
[SPEAKER_04]: contribution you've played in helping us
understand what you've learned and
[SPEAKER_04]: communicating that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you, Todd.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are gracious words.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also spent 15 years with publishing the
IHA, the J-I-H-A.
[SPEAKER_07]: Journal of the International Hemp
Association.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first science-based cannabis journal
in history.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a good effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really actually wanted to ask questions
about it, but I was sticking with Hashish.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first saw the journal in the 90s,
I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these educational kits that you put
together were fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was fortunate enough to buy one back in
the mid-90s that had crayons and oil and
[SPEAKER_04]: fabric and all of these wonderful elements
of teaching.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is something I would love you
guys to talk about because you really took
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis education into a peer-reviewed
level and actually created a little
[SPEAKER_04]: textile kit that you could touch,
feel, smell, and learn what cannabis was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And no one in the world has done that but
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to say thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But how the hell did you get to that in
between your Hashish and your cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Crayons.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did have a little free time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, it was kind of ideas that Sam and
I could cook up together.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was one of the pioneers in doing this,
really.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just needed a group that was really
devoted to getting real information out to
[SPEAKER_07]: people, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: They called it the International Hemp
Association.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was really the International
Cannabis Association.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dave Pape also helped us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave Pape was instrumental in this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Io Vanderwerf worked with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had a good team going.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we solicited articles from all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a lot going on in the early
90s that in a lot of ways, more variety of
[SPEAKER_07]: things going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then today, there are probably more
people involved than ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: The European Industrial Hemp Association
just met a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think they had close to 200
delegates this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, a bit of this is a CBD buzz because
it's become a hemp issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: But rightly so, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_07]: But some of that's a little bit of a bump
from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, I'm saying that that's a lot of
delegates to go to an industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_07]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're a pretty international bunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw people from all over the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know, but I read the word.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, when we got here, it was just
becoming legal to grow hemp again in large
[SPEAKER_07]: parts of Europe, Western Europe
especially.
[SPEAKER_07]: That effort, yeah, it was an effort we
could help with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we helped with the Vavilove Institute
trying to preserve what genetics they had.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure in hindsight how successful
we were.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how unsuccessful it had been before we
started working with them.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we'll find out with the Phylos project
again.
[SPEAKER_12]: While we worked with them, we were very
successful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we were successful in helping them
out and keeping things alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just maybe that the collections we
preserved weren't as pure breeding as we
[SPEAKER_07]: might hope they would be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of Carl Hilling's work showed this a
bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been interpreted other ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's probably just contamination.
[SPEAKER_07]: And trying to keep open pollinated lines
separate.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had over 400 of them, which they
produced in about nine different
[SPEAKER_07]: facilities or something back in the Soviet
days.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as all that fell apart, we took the
money and helped them get freezers and do
[SPEAKER_07]: all that stuff they needed to do to keep
what they had alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And grow some of it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was all fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that part of the collection just
moved into the hands of Ben Dronkers and
[SPEAKER_04]: Hempflax.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had the honor of visiting a test
plot where they had 200 different
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties growing simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was the gentleman out there
doing all the readings and such.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just great to see the diversity
in the varieties of hemp that came from
[SPEAKER_04]: the Vavilove.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's only, I believe, not even half
of what he forgot from them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just developed from their sessions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a hybrid between two of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then polished up from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that shows you what gene banks can be
good for right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually made the hybrid and gave it to
Jace Calloway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jace ran it in Finland, hence Spinola.
[SPEAKER_03]: High oil content was able to survive
under... I don't know if you can hear or
[SPEAKER_09]: not, but what's even more important is
that it's the highest seed yielding.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll give two tons per hectare,
where most varieties can barely get a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if it's the oil content or it's
just the amount of seeds that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like double.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a little short plant with a
great phenotype for seed production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I saw him speak about it in
Vancouver at the hemp symposium that they
[SPEAKER_03]: threw here one year in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I spoke at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then, you know, for those of us that
are still in the world where we're calling
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff sativa and indica, obviously
cannabis, evolution and ethanol botany,
[SPEAKER_04]: you kind of move away from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you see us classifying the current
cannabis that we smoke in a more
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriate manner?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first of all, let's talk about the
cannabis we don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned it earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: This represents the European or at least
Western Eurasian traditional varieties
[SPEAKER_07]: that were used for fiber and oilseed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those became the earliest sessions
taken to America on and on.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the rest of the cannabis, and we call
that cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what Carlos Linnaeus called cannabis
sativa.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not breaking with tradition.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's following tradition.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the rest of the world,
apart from that cannabis, all the rest of
[SPEAKER_07]: the cannabis in the world, except for
Western Europe, North America and a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit in South America and Chile,
a couple other places.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all indica.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether it comes from Afghanistan or India
or China or Korea or Thailand,
[SPEAKER_07]: some version of indica.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this is based on basically what Karl
Hillig figured out using isozymes
[SPEAKER_07]: differences in proteins rather than
differences in DNA, as people are more
[SPEAKER_07]: prone to do today.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is only research that was
published 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Karl basically showed through the
diversity of these compounds and terpenes
[SPEAKER_07]: and phenotypic characteristics as well,
gross phenotypes, that there were these
[SPEAKER_07]: differences.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that the large encompassing group was
cannabis divided into if you don't include
[SPEAKER_07]: the supposed wild or escaped types,
then three subspecies, basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: Indica subspecies indica, the narrow leaf
drug varieties from India, basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: The ones that Lamarck had described and
originally called cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, once again, following
tradition.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the main subspecies.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what we had before we had things
from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Mexican, the Colombian, the Jamaican,
like I talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thai, all came from and all the African
varieties too, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Came from southern Africa.
[SPEAKER_07]: Came from India, originally.
[SPEAKER_07]: From the Indian ganja varieties,
marijuana varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other one that we know about,
just to get the other one out of the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I pause you for a second?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys like actively making hash
over there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you got a rototap going in
the background.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the smart thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was me bubbling.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's trying to get the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your lung is so big that we can hear it in
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear you totally.
[SPEAKER_09]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've activated 43 kilos and 200 grams of
hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is making hash during hash church.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't hear it the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so repetitive and so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was only so many things it could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew he wasn't subtly drumming to his
beat in his own head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was motivated by, I'm gonna get high
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_07]: The long story, but I'll make it as short
as possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the Chinese varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were also for hemp and seed,
primarily.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a drug culture, at least not in recent
history.
[SPEAKER_07]: That one include Korea and Japan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those varieties are broad leaf temp
varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ended up calling them wide leaf hemp
varieties, as Carl called them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then there's of course Afghan.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cannabis indica, so species
afghanica, the broad leaf drug varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what came to us starting in the
late 70s and has been hybridized ad
[SPEAKER_07]: infinitum with the original narrow leaf
drug varieties we had.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's given us what we have today.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I see Mark and I see others,
John McPartland and Carl Hilligan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ernest Small, although he just published a
long paper and renamed them again,
[SPEAKER_07]: which I wasn't quite sure the need to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we all are reading pretty much
from the same page.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam's figures, it's about right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be interesting to put the Phylos
project to work and see the
[SPEAKER_07]: interrelatedness of the land races that
were around back in the day when they were
[SPEAKER_07]: first around and ones that were found
where they were originally from and put
[SPEAKER_07]: them into this project and see how they
are interrelated.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the evolutionary side that
fascinates me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of know what happened in the
historical side.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm much more interested to figure out
what, I don't know the predates,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's my historical side.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's asking about Japanese strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's saying, do you guys know
anything about any Japanese strains?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's been Korean ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Japanese have one registered variety.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a couple have been land races.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and a few other land races have one
registered variety.
[SPEAKER_13]: They use them to make kimonos.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they use them to make ceremonial
kimonos.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they have ropes and all kinds of
ceremonial uses.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really rare, expensive fiber.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, they do grow out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're mostly in a place called Tochigi.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they grow is Tochigi shiro.
[SPEAKER_07]: It means white Tochigi.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the government variety.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very low THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, I guess you saw the article where
they went and actually met with the women
[SPEAKER_13]: who actually made the garments.
[SPEAKER_13]: And their teeth are worn from pulling the
hemp with their teeth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Separating the fibers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it split the strips of bark into
narrower strips of bark.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They ran out of fingernails.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, where is the hemp finer?
[SPEAKER_09]: In Japan?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or in Korea?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or in China?
[SPEAKER_09]: The finest or the finest?
[SPEAKER_07]: The finest hemp we've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_07]: The finest hemp, finest yarns,
thinnest cloth would be Japanese or
[SPEAKER_07]: Japanese style cloth made in Korea,
you could also say.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I ask a paper question?
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's making the best paper in the world
right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: There used to be a mill that did cigarette
papers.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some stuff still in Turkey,
but it's closed.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's in Spain now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spain's got Silosa, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Silosa.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we used Schneidersohn for the journal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Schneidersohn was the paper supplier
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a big paper supplier.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: They made custom batches for us,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what they ended up doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: They sold it on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're probably the only ones that ever
bought it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We printed our journals on it just to be
patriotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to point out that I just tried to
link to your internationalhempassociation
[SPEAKER_04]: .org website, and the links to the
journals don't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get a 404.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could request that you all get that
fixed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's maintained as a labor of love.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, a few days ago it worked,
according to Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll probably come back on again.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a bit difficult to search articles on
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It isn't really indexed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to go to each issue and see
what's in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not too smooth.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's been up there for ages.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to ask, is there an economic
reason why hemp isn't being used more for
[SPEAKER_08]: paper and cardboard packaging?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's probably a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't make much sense to grow fibers
unless they have for things like
[SPEAKER_07]: packaging, unless they have a very
high-end use.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, hemp flax can grow hemp fiber and
get it into Mercedes-Benz car door panels
[SPEAKER_07]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they wouldn't be able to sell it for
enough if a paper processor bought it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also probably a limited number of
paper mills that could work with it
[SPEAKER_07]: anymore, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's another consideration.
[SPEAKER_07]: But even if there were, it doesn't travel
economically.
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to be done on a local basis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper making is polluting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's just a point.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the fact is that you're using
mostly waste from the wood and lumber
[SPEAKER_08]: industry to essentially turn into paper
and pulp.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the real story, Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: You need more hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why there isn't enough for
anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And exactly as Rob says, it needs to be
grown locally and processed locally.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've made hemp paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which basically they have to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're now mandated in the lumber
industry and everywhere else that they
[SPEAKER_07]: make ships to get rid of their weights
responsibly.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can actually sell it to a paper mill
if it's the right quality for them,
[SPEAKER_07]: some of it at least.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's kind of a win-win situation
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have to get much for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they got to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what you're competing against
with any natural fiber.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just about hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Flaks would have the same problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: It yields even less.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's why we had such problems with dealing
with hemp in Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were so landlocked to ship or move it
to actual factories to process it or strip
[SPEAKER_13]: it down into fiber, spin it into a fiber,
then ship it into the manufacturer that
[SPEAKER_13]: puts it into a cloth, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the herd and everything is lost along
the way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really kind of a waste because
it's just not enough of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's mostly grown for the fiber itself,
Mark, or it was back when we were dealing
[SPEAKER_13]: with it in Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess the way myself as an industrial
chemist, the way I look at it is that it's
[SPEAKER_08]: cellulose.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all cellulose.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the cheapest form of cellulose at
the end of the day is going to win.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so whether that cheapest form of
cellulose comes from off of the floor at
[SPEAKER_08]: the sawmill because the sawdust just
happens to be there, when you're making
[SPEAKER_08]: two by fours and lumber, okay,
I get that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the other thing that we have to take
into consideration is that there's a whole
[SPEAKER_08]: lot more chemicals that are used to
delignify wood than to delignify hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hemp's got a whole lot less lignin in
there, which is basically what you're
[SPEAKER_08]: doing in a paper mill.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just separating the lignin from the
cellulose because the cellulose is what
[SPEAKER_08]: the paper is.
[SPEAKER_08]: So at the end of the day, I don't know if
10 years or 20 years down the road,
[SPEAKER_08]: at some point, hemp is going to be a more
economical form of cellulose and will
[SPEAKER_08]: replace wood.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just an economic reality.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we're hoping for so.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just starting to see test trials
here in America in certain states now due
[SPEAKER_13]: to the legality.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to see a whole new
industry come out of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were talking 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: All the 50,000 products that can be made,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when the rubber hits the road,
Ben could only sell his herds for animal
[SPEAKER_13]: bedding.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what worked.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what worked economically.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what worked locally.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to happen locally and
regionally as these things come to scale.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the reality, is it's cheaper and
accessible right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what's going to happen,
and I don't know if Rob would agree with
[SPEAKER_08]: me on this, I think the main driver is
going to be protein production in the hemp
[SPEAKER_08]: seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Protein production in the hemp seed is
going to be the economic driver that's
[SPEAKER_08]: basically going to bring hemp to a scale
of farming that, again, is going to create
[SPEAKER_08]: a huge volume of cellulose that's going to
be cheaper than sawdust.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can tell you that the protein and
the seed is exactly what we grow hemp for
[SPEAKER_03]: in Canada for 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not to make it cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That seed sells for almost $15 or
something for a little 400ml bottle or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's become about the most expensive
product that you can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: This protein and the protein powder
isolate, that's the byproduct of pressing
[SPEAKER_03]: the seed cake to get your oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine if instead of roundup ready
soybeans all throughout Manitoba and
[SPEAKER_08]: Western Canada, imagine if instead of
soybeans, those were hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were hemp plants creating hemp seed
for hemp seed protein.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will happen someday because,
again, it's just— I think we grew 33,000
[SPEAKER_03]: hectares last year in Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, and Ontario.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is not a pimple on the ass of what's
grown in terms of soybean and corn,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or any flax or any of the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of the typical row vegetables or row
industrial crops.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have millions of acres of farmable
land, millions of acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a very small percentage of that,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because we've never turned it into
paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never turned it into products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always considered the fact that the
infrastructures are truly immense.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are billion-dollar infrastructures.
[SPEAKER_03]: People think it's just plug and play,
and they're like, oh, let's just use hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: for this instead of this, and we'll just
like— You don't even have to change
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, you do have to change everything,
and you do change a lot of things for
[SPEAKER_03]: certain things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with Mark that should there be
enough seed grown, and seed is the most
[SPEAKER_07]: viable thing to do with hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: It always has been since the hemp movement
changed, the way people were thinking
[SPEAKER_07]: about hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: The fiber thing has fallen away pretty
much and wears the paper, but the seed
[SPEAKER_07]: thing's carried on.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that really does take off, then,
of course, you'd have a byproduct from
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd have the chaff or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to chop it up and get rid of it
like any other industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can put it back on the fields.
[SPEAKER_07]: The lumber companies can't really put it
back in the forest, but there are other
[SPEAKER_07]: alternatives.
[SPEAKER_07]: There could be a surplus of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I'd like to mention is that when
the hemp thing was going 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: 15, 20 years ago, when it was at its
heyday, it was really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a lot of energy to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking back probably a lot of it was
premature.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think now is a much more opportune time
for somebody to try to get involved in the
[SPEAKER_07]: hemp business.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to go around telling people
that hemp is related to cannabis and,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, yeah, cannabis and all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The times have completely changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now everybody knows what cannabis is,
and everybody knows where hemp comes from,
[SPEAKER_07]: so not everybody, but a lot more people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be interesting to see if somebody
launches something these days with a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit better supplies of raw
materials possibly, even if the Chinese
[SPEAKER_07]: mills are still rocking, and Ben's trying
to get online in Romania.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be interesting to see how the second
wave of the hemp industry pans out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm excited to see how that
transpires, because after being part of
[SPEAKER_13]: the initial one that kind of fizzled,
there was a great deal of enthusiasm,
[SPEAKER_13]: and there still is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's great to see.
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw the HIA just had its gathering of
people and such, and there just needs
[SPEAKER_13]: innovation and more pushing, but again,
they're still stymied by this fictitious
[SPEAKER_13]: EU seed that I think is limitating
somewhat to the industrial ideas that
[SPEAKER_13]: we've been presented about cannabis,
but I still think that Ben and others have
[SPEAKER_13]: proven through firsthand realities,
even though, I mean, Ben himself took 17
[SPEAKER_13]: years lost to make a profit out of hemp
flax, so that's a great deal of time,
[SPEAKER_13]: money, research.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not many people have that, so again,
respect for even having that opportunity
[SPEAKER_13]: to do that, but he's led the way for many
of us to see that, yes, it can be done,
[SPEAKER_13]: because my car outside has his hemp in it
right now, and that's a beautiful thing,
[SPEAKER_13]: but yet a frustrating thing, because I
still have to tell people about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: They still don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: They still don't understand its
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's really right.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be fun to see how things change,
and I think the food products,
[SPEAKER_07]: the whole seed thing is really,
always has been the biggest interest to
[SPEAKER_07]: me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the fiber, and I like all the
interesting costumes women make,
[SPEAKER_07]: and all that, but when you hear them talk
about the seeds, and what they're good
[SPEAKER_07]: for, and how they've eaten them for years,
and then you realize that that's possibly
[SPEAKER_07]: even more important, especially in places
that have marginal supplies of good food.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, especially in areas of the world where
people don't have enough to eat,
[SPEAKER_08]: or people are dying, or they're not
getting a nutrition-enough diet,
[SPEAKER_08]: that this can be a matter of life and
death for a villain.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: for most of those places, though,
that are starving, if you think about it
[SPEAKER_07]: for a minute, they're not places where you
can grow hemp, so it's not like we're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to have people employed grow their
own food.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have to be an aid thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to ship it like rice,
and it's going to have to be grown where
[SPEAKER_07]: it's temperate climates, when that's North
America and Eurasia.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, right now, they're too busy plowing
down the rainforest to make room for more
[SPEAKER_08]: cattle ranches, so we could have more Big
Macs and T-bone steaks in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to grow more soybeans to feed those
animals, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what all that's kept out,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bingo, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So watch all the hemp seed that should be
going to human consumption.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to sign off here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a meat eater.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to meet sometime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome, Rob.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for holding it down.
[SPEAKER_13]: All you guys, thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Rob, as always.
[SPEAKER_13]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye bye, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy the evening in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
