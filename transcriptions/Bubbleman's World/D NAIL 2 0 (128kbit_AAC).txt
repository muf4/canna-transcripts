[SPEAKER_01]: Dude!
[SPEAKER_01]: John!
[SPEAKER_01]: You made it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Boneman's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to cut John off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to welcome the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let them know that John just rolled in
with the brand new D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 2.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently there are a couple of new
things in here that Brian and Stevie
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted me to check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we rip it open or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I picked it up and I
opened it and looked at it and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I go any farther... Alright,
well let's... Yeah, I just saw stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff, so... It's turning
around, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first off...
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the whips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is a titanium nail post-whip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same as the original one that I have.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the quartz one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is the quartz whip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were actually all packaged up,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: When John walked in, it wasn't the first
time he walked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just wanted to let you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to show everyone us opening the
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened it real quick and then we put it
back in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when you see us pulling things out
that aren't wrapped up, don't think the
[SPEAKER_01]: guys at D-Nail aren't packaging this
impeccably.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're sharing it with you now as if
we're opening it for the first time,
[SPEAKER_01]: which really about 20 minutes ago we
opened it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here's a new product.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the new post heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the old one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of a different product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the nail already screwed in
there, which I did just a few minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's spinning up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's the new post heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be taking good photos of all these
products as well so we can get a good
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always nice to see them up really
close.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool when I saw the post
heater.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing we haven't done is we have not
plugged it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no idea what the product is going
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and this secondary power cord,
it came and I looked at it and I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a little bit strange and low and
behold, it comes with a remote control
[SPEAKER_01]: that allows you to turn the unit on from a
distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I thought that was a really pretty
cool little, I mean not that I mind
[SPEAKER_01]: leaning over and clicking my D-Nail on,
but I have to admit I thought that was
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty cool of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so you want to get that on there,
do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like you were having a bit of a
difficulty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I was deciding if I was going to
tear it into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to cut it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to tear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tear.
Tear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's like when I got the call I was
actually at Canvas Culture, CHQ,
[SPEAKER_02]: and talking with the people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, you want to plug that into the
wall around the corner there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd go the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so here, hold this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get rid of this box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's the new 2.0 D-Nail Custom
Bubble Man Edition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was really, really cool of
them to put that little... They've got dry
[SPEAKER_01]: sift gland heads, which is probably your
dry sift, because I sent them photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember if it was yours or Sam's
or mine, but it's very likely it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they did my logo in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really did a great job on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The unit is quite a bit smaller than the
last D-Nail and I have one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unfortunately not a plastic,
just a plastic bodied one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give it a little unplug so I can show
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wood box version is right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the 2.0 next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, obviously the wooden box is additional
size added.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a smaller unit inside there,
but it gives you a pretty good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'd say they cut this D-Nail
down by about at least one third and close
[SPEAKER_01]: to half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting the first hit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow, look at the colors in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, can I have that out of the box?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to actually open those all out if
that's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this was typed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so this should also have... Yes,
that little guy over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, these three, three new quartz pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are pieces that they sent.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are a long time coming because
they've watched me use everything from a
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruhr bowl to a canine pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are quartz, I believe they're
quartz, carb caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there's the quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see, instead of going around
the outside of the bowl, it actually fits
[SPEAKER_01]: around the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it a lot more stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that guy out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they sent a couple more
versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow, fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a little mushroom top with a
little pen on it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's snug, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the snug.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's snug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the other one wasn't as snug as you
really thought that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we got that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last one before we can... Hey,
we've got to try this remote control
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably... So, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just turn it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, we've got to put the whip in
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there's the other carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got slits on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, those are slits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an outside one for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's also a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could carb with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how my carbs would fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say that's just as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure he knows I hit only with
quarts, but we'll ask Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we be using these with the quarts
or the tie, or can we use them with both?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're about to use them all right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think I'm here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, John, off-camera, already took
the most gigantic of rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, he's completely well-rounded right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say just functioning a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some of D420K's dry sift that you
hit there out of a Swiss perk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there's our little remote control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's our whip, because we're going to go
quarts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to go quarts, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, we're going to hit that
mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we'll pull out the mothership for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the cleaner of the two bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I have resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some very nice, full-metal dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to fill yourself up a bowl of
your own first, I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to smoke the dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which dry sift?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to have the dry sift
that we have from DK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some dry sift from D420K,
and then I also have some dry sift that I
[SPEAKER_01]: made from their resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have that here, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shall we plug this whip in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try this unit out and see what she's
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got this part in between that I don't
quite understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is plugged in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we've got to turn this on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect this has no batteries.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that has no batteries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, let's take this and plug it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, I think we'll get our
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's turning on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on at 72 right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you've got a little battery in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what temperature we're going to
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, she's climbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love getting new toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time I got my first
D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has two switches at the back of it,
and I had only hit the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely thought that it was not
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, it was working beyond
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to get on my own inability to
use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're climbing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: 294, 312, 332.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, it's a nice little small unit,
I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll plug that in in a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll try it out, because that's
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a button.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will work, but we'd have to plug it
back into this little piece right here
[SPEAKER_01]: that came with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does, but it doesn't really explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it just has this little button.
[SPEAKER_01]: You push the button, and this little
button goes on, guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, should we try it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to let this get up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we at, 630?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how it's lowered my bowl on my last
D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent me an 18 by mistake,
and all my bongs are 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this piece between my D-Nail and
the pipe, and it was putting the nail
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be quite a nice treat to
smoke like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the last time we were doing it,
and that thing was getting a little close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even now, when I was carving you on this
one, it was touching your hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do what we have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not too fussy, but it is nice when
things can work out a little better than
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they did a nice job.
[SPEAKER_01]: The box is sleek.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really am going to miss the Zebra wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to admit, I sold my other D-Nail to
D420K.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check him out on his YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your YouTube channel up now
too, don't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had one for about five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're actually doing something on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do something on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's had one for five years, but now he's
actually doing something on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to check out John H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfello.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your YouTube?
[SPEAKER_01]: John H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: John H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out his YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to be doing his own content as
well, because he can't just give me all
[SPEAKER_01]: his awesome content.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got to promote his own page,
and he wants to explain to you his grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what he uses, and how he does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of you have had questions for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go over to John H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfello's YouTube page, and you can learn
the questions from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, on that page is just me
fighting in my injuries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually get to know one of my
boats and where I came.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to have the first hit on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want the gold ever?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do the 90 Fresh Frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more than appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that video of us doing the Fresh
Frozen is almost at 10,000 hits now.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's neat to know that people are
watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking with people, and I was talking
there on the weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are coming over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking again today, and everybody
wants to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how am I doing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get away from this shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used two bags my whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you making it melt?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, well, if you want,
just go do a bubble man's world and learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why when they ask me about how
you grow and what you use, I just say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, go check out John Perfello's
page, because he's the man that's doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can answer your questions better than I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't answer your questions at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not even a matter of answering
them better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not John.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't grow his resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm lucky enough that you bring it over
and you share it with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think a lot of people will be
quite surprised of how small of a garden
[SPEAKER_02]: that I run and what I do and stuff like
that and how it just gives me this quality
[SPEAKER_02]: of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important for people to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the world of the internet, I know that
it's great that people love to assume
[SPEAKER_01]: large, big.
[SPEAKER_01]: You show only pictures of colas for the
longest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, as a photographer, I've gone into
many, many, many gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've actually had gardeners ask me not
to shoot their distance shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want macro shots, but they don't want
me shooting their garden from the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, it's not that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why does everything have to be a
multi-million dollar grow room?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow this plant in a small space
and take care of a multitude of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 by 10?
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at Phil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went up to Whistler to meet with Phil.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got his room full of tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's got his two tents in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me smile, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phil's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if he's got a YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if he did, I would be giving him a
shout out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're going to hit some of D420K's
derisive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm really excited to hit the brand
new Dino.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do the dump when I first did it,
so it melted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to get so high up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I like that one better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the best carb I've ever used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know why, but that was just
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hear the sift boil when I dropped
it in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two thumbs up, D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stevie, Brian, you guys are doing good
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the fact that you're constantly
pushing the boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're constantly upping the quality of
your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're constantly looking to pioneer new
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to continue to hit this D-Nail
as well as use all three dabbers that we
[SPEAKER_01]: got from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try that one right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to give you guys a shout
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check D-Nail out.
[SPEAKER_01]: On their web page, Facebook page,
it's D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a great little unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how this one is just so tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remote control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remote control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to plug it in and use the remote
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we do it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut her down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unplug her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if it's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is not on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hit that button.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to hit it over there?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: On it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard it click on the wall, so I knew
right away that it went on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just again, a really cool little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you could probably buy this
complete component yourself, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to support the people that are
pioneering the ideas, who are making these
[SPEAKER_01]: things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always the most important thing
to try and, oh, I could probably go buy
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, support these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just really stoked to have gotten
turned on to the electronic mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to bypass the torch thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never torched.
[SPEAKER_01]: I torched.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: All these little videos that I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I torched.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would torch the nails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was dabbing dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing that on all of these dab bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started dabbing dry sift with the torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were like, no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking I had dabbing dry sift,
so I was torching, but I was dabbing dry
[SPEAKER_02]: sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally bypassed torching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never owned one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You puffed, and then you went right into a
sublimator, and then you went right into
[SPEAKER_02]: the dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had the ember?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the ember's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very tasty flavor saver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sometimes miss putting the screen on
there with the full melt and bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looks proper, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This here, you don't really get to see it
as much, but you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like when I'm at home on my bong,
it's nice to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the final thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe, I believe this is a ceramic
insert that will fit inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sealed it off for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the flavor saver, apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is ceramic instead of titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So little white disc, tie nail,
fits right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually sits right on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it actually settled down into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to do some I wonder if it fits on
the courts as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little ceramic insert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we got to have a hit of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely makes it to me seem like the
way it fits anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: First bounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it fits is not something you'd
want to pass around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the way this is, you'd want to put
the pipe where you need it and then take
[SPEAKER_01]: the hit right off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to load it up for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you like, John?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want your first bounce?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the one hitting it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can tell me on the way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one to hit the ceramic flavor saver
disc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's hot enough?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't think ceramic is going to
take very long to max out on its
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, but we could give it a few
more minutes because I can honestly be
[SPEAKER_01]: honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm no expert on titanium or quartz or
ceramic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listen to a lot of you guys argue on the
internet and I find it somewhat laughable,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly when people say that the
titanium is medical grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys understand that means that
it's graded to be put inside someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: body, not to heat up red hot and smoke
resin off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like some medical titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you do, but it's medical grade
why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, because it's in my neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're arguing that it's medical
grade and that's why it's better to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to take the titanium out of my neck
and smoke on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, neck dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could just bend a piece out,
put the little hole there and you could
[SPEAKER_01]: dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we're just being babbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, I don't pretend to know the
most about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm bioassaying it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the idea of the metal as much
as quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ceramic seems pretty cool, but from what
I've read, there's qualities of ceramic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that's another thing to do
research on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important for you guys to do your own
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: John can let us know about taste right in
a minute.
How
[SPEAKER_00]: was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us John, tell us.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see the size of that hoop and
the flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean some was left on the dabber,
but wow, it looked killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might be a better one to dab
with snakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just literally the tiny little bit
of that you didn't finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could probably be a better idea with
this particular stuff to dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was two great big clear domes.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's what we just talked about,
what I was missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you pull that out and it's right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be your first bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably about 98%, 97%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more than one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to need to break that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a cool concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just talking about having to put a
screen on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of, I thought these inserted into
the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought they would sit on top,
but I love the idea for photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the visual that the thing we were
missing that we were literally just
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's what was so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those would have made a great video with
the clean white ceramic and the bubbling
[SPEAKER_01]: dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to get one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dirty now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how clean I'm going to be
able to get the ceramic, how porous it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but maybe if I flame it, I'll get it white
hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, if you flame it, that's the way you
get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a flame though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that ridiculous?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why this quartz nail has never been
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to torch that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've babbled on for longer than we need
to, but really the bottom line is the
[SPEAKER_01]: D-nail is a killer product when combined
with a pipe like the mothership and a
[SPEAKER_01]: quality resin like what John, myself and
D420K have been sharing with you all to
[SPEAKER_01]: make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wet wash, water hash, and dry sifted clean
sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: When those three are combined,
they're just an absolute trifecta.
True medicine.
Thanks again for coming out, John.
I super appreciate you bringing the 2.0
by.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, peace.
Thanks for joining us.
I'll see you next time.
