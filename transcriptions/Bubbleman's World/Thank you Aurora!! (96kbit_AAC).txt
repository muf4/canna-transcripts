[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is sort of a special episode as I'm
really filming this to thank an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: group of people that have really gone
above and beyond helping their fellow man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to tell you today,
I wanted to share it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, my camera was stolen
at the treating yourself cup, the champs
[SPEAKER_00]: show in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was taken right out of the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried very hard to track the people
down that had taken it, but to no avail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I lost the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my ability to take awesome macro
shots and all these wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about a day and a half after the news
of me losing my camera, John Berfello was
[SPEAKER_00]: contacted by a friend of his, Elise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Elise works for a company called
Aurora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are a cannabis license production
facility that have been applying for their
[SPEAKER_00]: license and are about to get their license
and have, I guess, a facility somewhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: Alberta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she called me up and she was there
when the camera was taken and she saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: devastation of both myself and John and
how it really, you know, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: education that we were giving and sharing
and what we were doing and then to be just
[SPEAKER_00]: our balloon be popped like that,
it disturbed her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she contacted Terry, the owner of
the company, and he's just a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically called me up within 36
hours of losing my camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And between the two of them, they said
that I had spoken with them a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: in regards to potentially shooting their
strains with my macro lens for them when
[SPEAKER_00]: they were ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Terry just put the offer out
through Elise to purchase me a new camera
[SPEAKER_00]: without promoting their company in any
way, which was really the righteous thing
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want me telling people about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't looking for free publicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't looking for me to tell
everyone that Aurora is the best company
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we should all be supporting
Aurora.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really just rootsy, conscious,
loving people who wanted to share and help
[SPEAKER_00]: a fellow human out who was down and out,
who had just been taken advantage of,
[SPEAKER_00]: lost this huge ticket item.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to put a huge thank you
out to John Berfello, to Elise,
[SPEAKER_00]: to Terry, and to everyone at Aurora.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The camera has been purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have it in the next couple of
days, early next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought it was important to go
online and share this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of local people are hating on the
licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying that they're nothing but
money-grubbing, greedy corporate entities
[SPEAKER_00]: that have come in to take advantage of the
medical marijuana situation here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I've seen from meeting this
group of people, and from the reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: they had to my camera being stolen,
and in particular asking me not to say
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I told them how I would say
something about it, in which case they
[SPEAKER_00]: said was fine, they never asked me to
support their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never asked me to tell everyone that
they were the best and to get behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they did was they got behind me as a
community member.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they helped me out immensely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to thank you guys,
Aurora.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable what you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the YouTube community is gonna
be stoked as well, because a lot of you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys were crushed as well by me getting my
camera stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just seemed so non-deserving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sitting out here in beautiful
British Columbia, surrounded by,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, great gardener genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Afghani and Barbara Budd over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Sweet Skunk, Mehdi Hayes from
John Berfellow, and the Congolese behind
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my Astro Boy up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my East Coast Sour Diesel right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, my little Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lamb's bread hybrid that I brought back
from Negril in 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm surrounded by beautiful genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surrounded by beautiful nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, thanks to people like Elise
and Terry and John and many, many others,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just great to see the community
supporting itself like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, it makes me want to do
more for my fellow man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a few things today where I called
people up that I could help and offered
[SPEAKER_00]: the same situation to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let me get you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't need to promote my company
or my bags or my product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about helping out when we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that note, I want to thank one of my
good buddies who comes and sees me in
[SPEAKER_00]: Toronto every year, and he brings me a
little bit of bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, he brought me the epic,
epic bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I photographed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a 10 out of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not disappoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I could give you a shout out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, of course, out of all these
wonderful people I meet, I spaced your
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please add a comment if you were the
guy that gave me this wonderful bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to take a little dab right now
in honor of kind people, in honor of the
[SPEAKER_00]: generosity, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many people told me that it would
come back to me and not worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would come back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'd like to add that Aurora isn't
donating the camera for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have worked out a deal with them in the
past where I would come and photograph
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants and their strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're pre-purchasing the camera for
me for work that I will do when I receive
[SPEAKER_00]: the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, that's just awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was a wonderful dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today also, you probably will notice that
I'm wearing my green Planet shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Green Planet is a local company here in
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Berfellows worked for them for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to give them a little shout
out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you guys are asking me what my
nutrients are that I'm using to grow my
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using a one part called Medi One.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sold and distributed by Green Planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check that product out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reminiscent to me, from someone who
hasn't grown for just over 15 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: of Earth Juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to add anything to my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super easy to pH and adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been growing me some wonderful
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice, heady, melty resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I've produced so far has been
full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's with a variety of strains so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see a variety more strains come
through the tent and get washed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have the Astro Boy, the Bubba
Chem, and the My Little Pony sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm flowering Astro Boy and My Little
Pony again down in my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm about to fill the tent up with
some Barb, Afghani, Sweet Skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: Congolese, Hoss, and East Coast Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep watching Bubble Man's World for
more updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thank you Aurora.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
