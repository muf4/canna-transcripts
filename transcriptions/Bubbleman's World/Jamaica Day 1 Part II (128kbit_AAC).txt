[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to bubble man's world everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are in st.
[SPEAKER_07]: Catherine's, Jamaica, and I don't know if
John and I could be any happier I'm eating
[SPEAKER_07]: fresh fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got a breadfruit right behind you
you've got mangoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see tomatoes down there The yard is
covered in beautiful fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is definitely a good vibe place And
we're happy to have about a pound of some
[SPEAKER_07]: beautiful sun-grown Jamaican ganja that
sun-grown tropical grown glandular We've
[SPEAKER_07]: got our tri-comb heads for the bubble man
and John to isolate using our water and
[SPEAKER_07]: ice extraction methods So John's been
helping me for the last year or so and
[SPEAKER_07]: he's a good assistant and an even better
friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you right now I'd be
puffing on this herb and it is killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a great buff from it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So can't wait to get this resin in this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We brought the originals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we brought the original bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of you out there know that we have
three levels of bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got our lights, our inexpensive models,
to get the newbie non-hash maker or
[SPEAKER_07]: perhaps the guy that's kind of lost his
way and he's gone towards this making oil
[SPEAKER_07]: with chemical solvents.
[SPEAKER_07]: The exposure is negative.
[SPEAKER_07]: The potential of blowing yourself up and
burning your skin off your body is
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is ITAL.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is ITAL.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no chemicals.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just water and ice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is what we're here to do today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Isolate some resin glands.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put the bags in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_07]: And get this started.
[SPEAKER_07]: I so wish I could be joining you right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but the best part of what is this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't smoked cannabis for 13 years
because I smoke exclusively hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I only smoke the active ingredients in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And every once in a while, like in this
particular situation where I have no hash,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm feeling it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you feeling it a little bit?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm definitely feeling it because it's
very tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it smells great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're gonna start with the 25 micron
bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a bunch of people here and
behind the camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're gonna stay off camera,
but I'm basically kind of talking to them
[SPEAKER_07]: while I'm talking to you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're teaching them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're educating them and then we're
also learning ourselves because we're out
[SPEAKER_07]: of our normal environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are in a high humidity, high heat,
warm water environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: The herb, everything's different.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple months ago, John and I were in
Barcelona, Spain and we were making some
[SPEAKER_07]: hash there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys probably remember we met with
Javier from Medical Seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We met from David from Ripper Seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We went inside the guys at hemp quarters
and we made hash all over the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we're gonna break that record
here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been here for half the day and we're
already running our first batch,
[SPEAKER_07]: which I have to say I come quite often.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's always, you know, you're not just
gonna land and just go make hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: You land and then you kind of go get like
a go eat some ITAL food and then you go
[SPEAKER_07]: and you look for buckets.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everyone's got a bucket, but not so
much available for you to have.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it took us a couple hours to find the
buckets and we got those.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're five hours in and we're making hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the herb was completely easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never had that be easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually have to go out and really sort
of put my nose to the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a bit of an olfactory that's very
sensitive to cannabis and terpenes and
[SPEAKER_07]: smells.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm able to find extremely good
cannabis wherever I go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Using those tools at my disposal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I hear people say, oh,
I went to Jamaica and the herb was so
[SPEAKER_07]: terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I say to those people is that's just
what you could find.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was what your personality brought to
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't put the right vibe out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you didn't get the right herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't know what to say,
but try to find the right vibes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll find the right herb in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about that simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and the vibes here are amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know how you didn't find it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a 45 micron bag for you,
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're doing here for everyone
watching, because they potentially never
[SPEAKER_07]: seen this procedure before is we're
stacking a sieve stack.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like mining for gold.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like, if you think of these are
screens and they have holes in them and
[SPEAKER_07]: the smallest screen, the bottom,
the purple is a 25 micron and a micron is
[SPEAKER_07]: a measurement increment that is extremely
small.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your hair, for instance, is seven microns
in diameter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very, very small, smaller than we can
see with our eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we start with a 25 and we go up with a
45 and each screen size from here on out
[SPEAKER_07]: is going to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_07]: And why that makes sense is because the
holes need to be big and then small and
[SPEAKER_07]: then smaller and then smaller.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what that does is it allows us,
once we've separated off the material,
[SPEAKER_07]: once we've mixed all the ganja and the
resin has broken free and sunk in the
[SPEAKER_07]: water, all we're going to do is pull these
bags one by one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And clean out the hash that's left on the
bottom of the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are variables to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to make sure our water is
extremely cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: This would have been better if we even
left it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a freezer and it's sitting
right there or a fridge, of course,
[SPEAKER_07]: have it in there right up until the moment
that you put everything in the buckets and
[SPEAKER_07]: you start mixing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you understand the process,
and I've sort of given these guys a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit of a low down on the glandular
trichome, glandular trichome, of course,
[SPEAKER_07]: is the little part of the cannabis plant
that we all love.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's why they sing songs about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's why we promote it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's why we wear ganja leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's why we gather.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's why people go to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_07]: People come to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, really, that is the reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an incredible plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: The industrial properties of hemp we know
have 50,000 commercial products from
[SPEAKER_07]: anything from plastics to hemp crete to
hemp metals.
[SPEAKER_07]: The amino acid rich essential oil
secreting seeds are second to none.
[SPEAKER_07]: They contain all eight essential amino
acids that our bodies need but can't
[SPEAKER_07]: produce, including the three for children.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is basically a whole food.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hemp is the perfect food.
[SPEAKER_07]: They say, actually, that it's second only
to breast milk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure about you, but I'm done with
breast milk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sticking to hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hemp seeds, I love them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can't get, you know,
I mean, they were good enough for Buddha,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: How long did the Buddha survive on hemp
seeds?
[SPEAKER_07]: One hemp seed a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for like a very, very, very long
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out the story.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a Buddhist, but Buddha seemed like
a pretty cool guy, I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You read into what he was all about,
and I mean, it's hard to kind of be
[SPEAKER_07]: anti-Buddha.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So 73, this is the gold bag, and this is
just what you guys would think.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about gold?
[SPEAKER_07]: We love the gold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the gold as in gold from the ground,
but the sun, the gold, the red,
[SPEAKER_07]: gold, and green.
[SPEAKER_07]: The gold does not represent gold in the
red, gold, and green.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this gold, I made it the 73 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the year that I was born in,
1973, and when I first made these bags,
[SPEAKER_07]: the 73 bag was the favorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the favorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: It still is, to a point, the favorite,
but I got the black bag, and the black bag
[SPEAKER_07]: is superior, in my opinion, in every way.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my favorite bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the resin that I personally
prefer, almost out of any strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from perhaps a land ray sativa,
a tropical sun-grown sativa that isn't
[SPEAKER_07]: going to grow short and stout,
but it's going to grow very tall with a
[SPEAKER_07]: very thin leaf, as opposed to a broad
indica leaf, and it's going to produce
[SPEAKER_07]: heads that produce a different cannabinoid
profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a cannabinoid profile is,
for the gentlemen all sitting here,
[SPEAKER_07]: is the cannabinoid profile is the profile
of everything we love about ganja inside
[SPEAKER_07]: that glandular trichome head that I was
showing you guys earlier on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That glandular trichome head has terpenes,
which are smells, terpenoids, which are
[SPEAKER_07]: tastes, so I mean, obviously, those are
the things we love.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone loves squeezing the herb and
giving it a smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like the precursor to smoking and
getting iry, is to smell your ganja.
[SPEAKER_07]: Walking through the forest, if you've ever
approached a big ganja field, getting hit
[SPEAKER_07]: with that, the smell of that, is a
potentially spiritual event.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say that much about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get our black bag in there with the
yellow, and we're going to go from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even think I'm going to bend them
over the bucket, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: You looking at some beauty there?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at how beautiful these
trichomes look, and like Mark was talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about, with the sun-grown tropical
sativas, these resin heads are so small,
[SPEAKER_06]: but just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, look at that plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely very different here,
growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Different soil, different environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Different humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that I've never seen up
close like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm used to growing indica's, of course,
indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in Canada, but I mean,
definitely, when we take a look at this
[SPEAKER_06]: resin, you can tell the difference night
and day by just looking at it between
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor and indoor, in Canada,
growing here on the equator.
[SPEAKER_06]: By far, the two joints, I just smoked two
big fatties.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm motivated.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think any of you guys have ever
seen me do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you should roll another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best part about this is we take a look
at the mesital effects of sun-grown
[SPEAKER_06]: tropical sativas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty much experiencing the great
effect of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we're going to try and break
all of this off of the stock.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want it all on the stock.
[SPEAKER_07]: How does that feel?
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to break it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to ask a quick question in
regards, because I know you use indica.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have indica, and we have sativa.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, Rob Clark, the author of
Marijuana Botany, as well as a wonderful
[SPEAKER_07]: book called Hashish, one of my mentors,
he's actually now talking about cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: afghanica.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look up that on Google if you want
to learn a little bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've now put our 120 bag in and our 160
bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll explain to you why we're using all
these bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine that some of the glandular
trichome heads are the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can separate them out, and if we can
use these larger, holed bags in the
[SPEAKER_07]: beginning, because often people say,
why do we need all these bags?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't I just do it with one?
[SPEAKER_07]: This particular bag, in particular,
will filter out contamination.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things that are still small, they're going
to break down a little smaller than they
[SPEAKER_07]: should have, and they're still going to
sink, whereas everything else,
[SPEAKER_07]: as long as it has a surface area,
it'll float in the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: When things get too small, they sink down.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why I have this bag, and it's also
why I have this bag, just to filter out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Generally, these two bags will be a
medible quality, although here in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_07]: they still actually produce some decent
resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: The real magic will be in the orange,
the black, and the yellow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes the white and the purple can
really surprise you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, these three bags are the ones
we're going to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine we're going to isolate all the
resin glands off the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking a pound, we could be left with as
little as 20 grams of resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how much active ingredient is on an
actual pound of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you extract those 20 grams,
we're going to get 20 grams through all
[SPEAKER_07]: the different bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I get a gram and a half here,
that's no good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't count that.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I get another two grams here,
I don't like that either.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't count that either.
[SPEAKER_07]: My 20 grams can shrink down incredibly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once we explain this to the
prohibition-based mentality of how much
[SPEAKER_07]: can I get and how fast can I get it,
which is where we've been locked with
[SPEAKER_07]: ganja for the last 40 to 50 years,
at least in North America and Europe,
[SPEAKER_07]: parts of Asia, it's a how much can I get
and how fast can I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen it happen here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was coming here in the 90s,
it was nothing for me to find the lamb
[SPEAKER_07]: spread.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nothing for me to find the
lamb-raised sativas.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very easy for me to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nowadays, it's a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_07]: You almost have to seek out an elder.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to go to a bobo camp or a
niabingi camp and find an elder who's had
[SPEAKER_07]: his strain, and he's kept it, and he still
has it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because all the growers, and it's not
their fault, that they fell into this
[SPEAKER_07]: because everyone falls into this.
[SPEAKER_07]: They grow these short little sticky stalk
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're still very powerful and amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do grow a wonderful grade of
medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can imagine, when Babylon had their
way and decided we'd make cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: illegal, part of their trip was to make it
a how much can I get and how fast can I
[SPEAKER_07]: get it thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: What they did is they turned us,
the people that believe in this plant,
[SPEAKER_07]: the people that believe in the
righteousness and the spirituality of this
[SPEAKER_07]: plant, they turned us into modern day how
much can I get, how fast can I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't tell you how many people have this
mentality in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_07]: The unfortunate part is that when you
shrink down your flowering period to six
[SPEAKER_07]: to eight weeks, as opposed to a sativa,
which could easily flower for three
[SPEAKER_07]: months, 20 plus weeks, you could flower a
sativa.
[SPEAKER_07]: You understand the prohibitionist-based
mindset, how much can I get and how fast
[SPEAKER_07]: can I get it, is going to be like,
oh man, I don't want to grow that sativa.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes me 22 weeks to grow that plant
from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can bang out these indicas in seven to
eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: While you're doing one crop, I've pulled
out three.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great, but what you're growing is
resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: In that resin is a profile and that
profile is going to offer you a medicinal
[SPEAKER_07]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can imagine, the prohibitionist,
as brilliant as they were in their evil,
[SPEAKER_07]: they cut us out from our land race
genetics, the land race genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can only understand that this is
the equivalent of the world population.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we took those and we got rid of them
and we started getting smaller and smaller
[SPEAKER_07]: and smaller, it's basically inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be the equivalent of going and
having a kid with your sister.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't get good gene structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't produce strong plants and you
won't produce a good medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to bring traits and phenos in
from the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where land race comes in.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where these African sativas and
these Indian plants, where they've been
[SPEAKER_07]: making hash sheesh for 8,000 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys have a serious ganja culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have been to India.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can attest.
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys, they don't even smoke ganja.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were to smoke ganja, they would
just be so confused by it because they
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke only the hash that's off the ganja.
[SPEAKER_07]: They still have archaic methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, they have the most archaic method
because they have the longest history with
[SPEAKER_07]: this plant in any culture on our planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: What they do is they hand rub the resin,
if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here in Jamaica, they do it to an extent
but it's a lot more ... Back in the day,
[SPEAKER_07]: I seen it off of sledgehammers that they
were hammering into tires.
[SPEAKER_07]: The gum that you could pull off that
sledgehammer was incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, here in Jamaica, they don't
trim with scissors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Scissors are hard to find.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most Jamaicans will use a knife and their
thumb.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll curl that leaf in and they'll
pinch it against their thumb.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time I saw it, I thought,
wow, that's got to take so much time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, John and I don't even trim our
plants, if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We only make hash out of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We go into our grow room.
[SPEAKER_07]: We cut down fresh, beautiful, grown plants
and then we throw them in this bucket and
[SPEAKER_07]: we mix it and we make water hash,
which is I guess what we're going to do
[SPEAKER_07]: right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last two bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get rid of all of this,
I'm going to roll them up one more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the smell of it in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I brought a bunch of my
maintenance here to Jamaica and I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: passing them around.
I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are stoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't love to get a gift,
let alone a super cool ganja-oriented
[SPEAKER_07]: gift, that can A, keep the police from
harassing you because the police,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're not the smartest but they have
noses.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: We love our stinky cannabis and it makes
it so easy for the police to realize we
[SPEAKER_07]: have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They smell it on us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even when they don't smell it on us,
they lie and they say they smell it on us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the 220 in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we could start doing is, I'm going to
pour this into here, part of it,
[SPEAKER_07]: about half and then we'll break the bud
into the top of the ice and then we'll
[SPEAKER_07]: pour more ice and water on top of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like we would do in a bubble bag
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: We put the ice on the bottom and we put
the herb on top.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should not pick this up, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're saying is we always want the
ice on the bottom and then you put the
[SPEAKER_06]: herb on top and how we do it back at home
is we put ice, herb, ice, herb,
[SPEAKER_06]: ice, herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all in one bag and then we mix that
all together because we want to get the
[SPEAKER_06]: most out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, we're trying to keep this as
cold as possible and the more ice the
[SPEAKER_06]: better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you grab me that cooler in the back of
the car?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just thinking out loud, we've got Ashley
in the back here giving us a hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: We brought a cooler here so we can keep
this even colder once we make the... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: once we make the hash, this is...
Basically, this process is pretty darn
[SPEAKER_07]: simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: You break your bud down, not too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: You break your bud down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me go back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: This process is counter-intuitive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even every person here is going to watch
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll have a certain understanding of
it, but immediately they'll start thinking
[SPEAKER_07]: of ways they can do it better based on
what they think is happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did the same thing and everyone's done
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: In North America, particularly in America
because Americans are just so gung-ho and
[SPEAKER_07]: like, let's do it big, let's do it large,
let's go as strong as we can.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm showing people how to mix with a stick
and the Americans are getting outboard
[SPEAKER_07]: motors from their boat and literally like
running it in kiddie pools.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, what that does is it turns
the cannabis to mulch.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you see that these are microscopic
glands, we don't need a vortex mixer.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need an extremely powerful drill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today, we're going to make this with a
stick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to mix it with a stick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got machines that I sell that you can
use.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easier even to use a cake mixer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to use a cake mixer here in Jamaica
all the time, which was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a little handheld tool with the two
little prongs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would spin it around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your stock also has a use, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis stocks can make paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can make hemp Crete from this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, what we're sitting on right
here could be made out of hemp grown on
[SPEAKER_07]: the back mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually quite simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just lime.
[SPEAKER_07]: You mix lime, you mix water, you mix hemp
fibers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they take the stocks and they chop
them up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a whole process.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look into it if you don't know
about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, cannabis stock is just biomass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you can make concrete out of
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this up, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love to get that ganja on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how I get the extra medicated
because, of course, it goes through your
[SPEAKER_06]: skin because of oils and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: You rub a little coconut oil on your hands
while you're doing this or do it after
[SPEAKER_07]: you've got gum on your hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rub coconut oil on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a transdermal effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: That will actually bring those
cannabinoids into your skin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, your skin is an organ.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the largest organ in your body.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_07]: The epidermis, of course, is where we find
quite a few CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_07]: A quick little science breakdown so you
don't have to confuse anyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: We discovered in the 80s and the 90s CB1
receptors.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you guys heard about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is when they said they found
receptors for THC in the brain.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had receptors that the cannabis would
bond to these receptors.
[SPEAKER_07]: These were called CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were found in a high concentration in
the brain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then about eight years later, I think it
was 92 or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it the Spanish woman who discovered
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Christina?
[SPEAKER_07]: Christina.
[SPEAKER_07]: Christina basically came up with CB2
receptors.
[SPEAKER_07]: These CB2 receptors are located throughout
the rest of the body in organs,
[SPEAKER_07]: in your lymphatic system.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also receptors for cannabinoids in
those organs.
[SPEAKER_07]: What that really means is that this system
called the endocannabinoid system that
[SPEAKER_07]: regulates all of our biological function.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not all, but I'd say 90% of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: An extremely high amount.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eating and sleeping and remembering and
forgetting.
[SPEAKER_07]: All these things are based on your
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_07]: For instance, PTSD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Postpartum stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_07]: People go to war.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do things they don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: They come back all messed up.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have messed up their endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't forget.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't forget what they did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they shouldn't forget what they did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way, cannabis is very helpful for
them to release that energy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Release that tortured energy that they
basically ... Some of them did it on their
[SPEAKER_07]: own, but a lot of those guys aren't bad
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just got thrown into the army and the
next thing you know they're in another
[SPEAKER_07]: country doing crazy things.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know cannabis is extremely well for
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That can be worked either through smoking,
vaporizing, transdermal patches,
[SPEAKER_07]: decarboxylation of the cannabis and then
eating it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can discuss all these things a little
later on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to tell them a little bit about
decarboxylating, John?
[SPEAKER_06]: Decarboxylating, so it's basically
activating the THC molecules in the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids so they bind to receptors in
your brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: While smoking ... Because they will not
bind.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will not bind if you just eat bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to heat it so you get that a
4-cafetta.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we eat bud, we're getting THCA.
[SPEAKER_07]: THC acid.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting CBDA.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting all these cannabinoids and
THCs in the A's, the acid.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we decarboxylate, all it is simply is
we heat to a certain temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your temperature?
[SPEAKER_06]: I go 320 degrees Fahrenheit or 162 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just under 200 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you're going to do is scientifically
you're going to lose a carboxylic acid
[SPEAKER_07]: ring on those molecules.
[SPEAKER_07]: What that does is they turn all those
THCAs and CBDAs into THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now when you consume those products ...
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're drying even your bud will
actually activate cannabinoids because,
[SPEAKER_06]: of course, there's heat generated when
drying and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's make sure ... Look at this.
[SPEAKER_07]: See this stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it is only the 160 bag,
but let's just do this so I can ... We're
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit messy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're loose.
[SPEAKER_07]: This will just alleviate that problem of
us losing any ... That's one more reason
[SPEAKER_07]: why you have those extra bags in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the thought of plant matter going
into my 90 micron hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, I don't like it, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, going back to when they
discovered the ECS, the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_06]: system, for those of you who don't know,
it was discovered in 1977.
[SPEAKER_06]: They found receptors in pigs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where the research started.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like, what the hell is this shit
going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: After working just under 12, 11 years,
then they found it in the human brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting that they knew it was
there, but then they made it so illegal
[SPEAKER_06]: knowing that we actually need it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, things are changing, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an interesting thing because the
endocannabinoid system, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_07]: is just ... It's something straight people
have never known about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you, Dr. David Allen had a
really good point.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said that people with massive
endocannabinoid deficiencies that are
[SPEAKER_07]: beyond and above a normal endocannabinoid
deficiency, these people basically get a
[SPEAKER_07]: type of brain damage against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the cannabis prohibitionists
that will throw you away in jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll ruin your life.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll shoot your dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll take all your things.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't care if your kids are crying.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't care about any of that because
they're completely not tuned in to their
[SPEAKER_07]: own system.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really liked when David Allen said that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes so much sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are prohibitionists?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are the people that don't use
cannabis, why do they care if we use it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Seems to be a little bit silly.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think we got in here right
now, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to run a whole pound.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say about 100 grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say we got ... Pounds in Jamaica are
generally under a pound because you get
[SPEAKER_07]: stock and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm kind of breaking this up.
[SPEAKER_07]: These five gallon bags generally will fit
200 grams of dried bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you stuff too much bud into the bucket,
the resin won't be able to filter down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll get caught in the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's key that we do the right amounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I often weigh, but we also don't dry our
bud anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: We run it fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you got fresh bud, you got a freezer
right beside you, throw it into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next bubble we make will be in a ganja
field.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be cutting those plants down fresh
and going right into the bucket.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's definitely the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember hiking for 40 minutes into the
hills here in Jamaica back in 2002 when I
[SPEAKER_07]: came out with international iconographic
in Gypsy Nirvana who's now in Milano
[SPEAKER_07]: prison awaiting extradition from the
Philippines to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hope they don't get them,
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: They already got Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_07]: We shouldn't give them Gypsy Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is definitely cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I put my hands in there, I got the
shiver up my spine and I can taste it.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Goods.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we get the herb into the ice,
it's breaking a lot better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well it's nice to break the herb
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, you don't want to break it
into powder.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you definitely want to get it broken
down so that it's going to release those
[SPEAKER_07]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I did see when I looked at this
bud with the loop, you see definitely how
[SPEAKER_06]: the trichomes were deep in there because
with the sativas, they're not as tight as
[SPEAKER_06]: the indica buds that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_06]: The rock hard, which you always see on my
videos, which I talk about is how dense
[SPEAKER_06]: and how rock hard those indicas are.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not that type of bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the kind of bud I love.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is his favorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I say it all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm constantly defending the herb in
Jamaica because you get touristy people
[SPEAKER_07]: come here and it's like, listen,
man, just because you came here and didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: find anything worth finding, that
certainly isn't to say that something
[SPEAKER_07]: worth... People constantly say when they
can't find something that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: exist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there's no good weed in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the most insane statement that you
could ever possibly make.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, it's ignorant to say it because it
shows that you must have stayed at
[SPEAKER_07]: Sandals, never visited any real people on
the island and literally just bought,
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, shwaggy moldy brown weed
from the local hotel guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't stay in hotels when you come to
Jamaica if you can help it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get out of those all-inclusives.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those hotels don't leave any money on this
island.
[SPEAKER_07]: They take it all off and they don't pay
employees properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all a pretty bad scene in general.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always prided myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time I came to Jamaica,
I stayed in a tent and everyone was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can't stay in a tent.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, why not?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm bringing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's going to stop me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the army did actually at one point
in time try to stop me, but I found when I
[SPEAKER_07]: bribed those guys with a big buck knife
that I had, they just buggered right off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was amazing, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the middle of the bush, these guys-
We're going back into the early 90s,
[SPEAKER_06]: so we're talking a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guarantee things have changed here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the 90s that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sure look forward to the
decriminalization here in Jamaica
[SPEAKER_07]: happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty big steps for Jamaica to take to
decriminalize.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two ounces for personal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think even more importantly than the
decriminalization of two ounces is to let
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone that's in jail out if they're in
for cannabis crimes, potentially
[SPEAKER_07]: repatriations and felony.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clean the charges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those people can't be charged for
something that was simply an unreasonable
[SPEAKER_07]: government-toed line from the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_07]: The 1937 drug and peace and narcotics
treaty that the United States,
[SPEAKER_07]: of course, got all the other countries to
sign up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically what's been holding
everything up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why for so long, nobody's been able to
grow cannabis legally and actually
[SPEAKER_07]: experiment and do good work with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should not show what's going on in
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: We could show it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a little bucket of ice,
a little bucket of bud in here if you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: want to check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to put more ice in.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to put more ice and water over
top of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice showing there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to come in here with this nice,
beautiful spear and he can take a better
[SPEAKER_06]: look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what we're washing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're getting close, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're getting close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, what are we getting?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to put a bunch more ice over
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm down about here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to grab some ice over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want that whole bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe not actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a pretty,
[SPEAKER_07]: can never use enough ice in this process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't ever think you're using too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in every video we say,
keep it cold, keep it cold, keep it cold,
[SPEAKER_06]: keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at this point in time, you guys have
seen me and John make hash out on the
[SPEAKER_07]: Pacific Ocean on a boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made it with DJ Short once and Mark
Emery actually on a school bus driving
[SPEAKER_07]: around Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was trippy.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were no school kids on it though.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had just rented it for our own sort of
Tokers Bowl party that we were having.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made it in Jamaica a bunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Made it all over the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Switzerland, Germany, Italy, France,
London, India, Thailand, Korea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've made hash all over the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm happy to be here doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: John's going to start mixing up the
medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always get a rhythm going.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're fine with that rhythm.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do really well with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we saw this on some of our videos that
we did with Whistler.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, by the chicken mist.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll pour out on the sides.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're getting water pouring out on the
sides, don't be worried because the resin
[SPEAKER_07]: is trapped inside the screens.
[SPEAKER_07]: That right there is a good mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can get that for five to 10 minutes,
we're going to assure glandular trichome
[SPEAKER_07]: isolation and decontamination.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can definitely feel how sticky my hands
are with the resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got this great drink here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Real Jamaican sorrel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorrel juice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's quite nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a little cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: So back at home, I have washing machines.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very small washing machines.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get them out of China.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're about this big.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have bigger ones as well, but these are
an incredible product.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're fairly inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll actually wash your clothes,
but they'll also wash the resin off of
[SPEAKER_07]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is one of the variables that a lot
of people can make mistakes in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said earlier, the majority of the
time people try to over mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: They try to put too much mix into the
material.
[SPEAKER_07]: With dry material, what can happen is you
can break it up more than you want to and
[SPEAKER_07]: create contamination.
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically it's a fine line of mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why I started selling the
machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not because I thought people needed
another machine when you can totally do
[SPEAKER_07]: this with a stick, but it took out the
variables of people worrying about ruining
[SPEAKER_07]: their product.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for John and I, it's nothing to
throw kilos and kilos and kilos into water
[SPEAKER_07]: and ice and just mix it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally run hundreds of pounds of bud
into hash, eight to 10 pounds of hash at a
[SPEAKER_07]: time with this process every three to four
days.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that I've done in the
past.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm doing a lot less these days.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really isolating on those levels
anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mostly isolate for myself and for John
for our own personal medicinal reasons.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can give a man a fish and he'll be
happy, but you teach a man to fish and
[SPEAKER_07]: that is a whole different ball game.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we're doing right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not coming in and saying,
we have all the secret proprietary
[SPEAKER_07]: knowledge and we know how to do a bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: That you don't know how to do our whole
trip is showing people how to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't be leaving Jamaica with these
bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be leaving them here with the person
that got the most excited about learning
[SPEAKER_07]: and the person that's the most gung-ho on
getting this started and turned into a,
[SPEAKER_07]: not a business, but a journey.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a journey to the unadulterated
cannabinoid high.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you experience that pure essence
of job through just the resin without that
[SPEAKER_07]: contamination, it is either whether you
want to call it a religious experience,
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally call it a spiritual
experience and I am lucky enough to have
[SPEAKER_07]: it every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people call it habitual, but every
day for me and John, it's a ritual.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've made a lot of John's water hatch with
and for him over the course of the last
[SPEAKER_07]: year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happily.
[SPEAKER_07]: John's done a lot for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: John helps a lot of people selflessly on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to know how to find
happiness in your life, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be by collecting baubles and gold chains
for yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually going to be going out and
doing something for someone, not
[SPEAKER_07]: necessarily that has less, but maybe just
a person that needs a little bit of help
[SPEAKER_07]: or a smile or a nice word or two.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're good like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the machine, when I'm mixing like
this, I'll generally mix for six minutes
[SPEAKER_07]: with my machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm hand mixing and the mixing is
going to be a little less standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'd say about 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty nice, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently they're available in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hey, I'm buying cases of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm making bubble hash in Jamaica,
I drink sorrel juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things about John and I,
you'll notice is we don't promote anything
[SPEAKER_07]: that we don't love.
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually have this thing called
integrity, which lowers profits immensely,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it creates better vibes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you see us on our show,
when we're promoting a certain type of
[SPEAKER_07]: product or tool or whatever, it's not
because a company has approached us and
[SPEAKER_07]: said, hey, listen, if you just tell
everyone my product is the best,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll pay you so and so money.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't take money from companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just promote the products with a high
integrity that we believe in that you
[SPEAKER_07]: should, in the least, check out if you're
along the same path.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think to make it very clear,
we're going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we like it, we'll use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why with the LED light,
people are asking me already, do you like
[SPEAKER_07]: the LED?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like the Lush?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm only starting to grow my first
crop with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can't really tell you if I like it
yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't really promote it in a way
that says, yeah, you should go buy one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I haven't actually grown any resin
with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once I've grown my cannabis and I've
extracted the resin and I've actually
[SPEAKER_07]: smoked the resin with John, then we'll
have an idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to set us up with the
pressing screens?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting pressing screens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're right in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the final part.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you've done your mixing, I'm not done
yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to mix for about five more
minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you've done your mixing, we settle
for about five minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, as I talk, little trichomes
have been broken off this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're actually sinking in this
bucket.
[SPEAKER_07]: For me as a cannabis aficionado and lover,
I always get so excited about sharing this
[SPEAKER_07]: information with people that I know love
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they don't know about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, imagine all your life,
all you ever had was grape juice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then one day, someone just came over
to you and said, have you ever seen these?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they showed you grapes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the equivalent to what we're doing
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we lift these bags and you just see
this sandy kind of product, you'll get the
[SPEAKER_07]: idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, I'm talking to my Jamaican
friends here, not so much the people back
[SPEAKER_07]: at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know you guys have been watching
these videos for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know you guys pretty much know this
process inside and out.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys have any questions at all,
feel free to shout them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not interrupting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll edit this video.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can pause and cut things out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want you to be lost at any point
in this process.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's ever a point where you're like,
why did you do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it you're doing right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just interrupt and ask me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these bags, here's a funny little
story, are made in Nepal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nepal Kathmandu, huge Shivaite Baba group
in Nepal, Shivaratri, of course,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is Shiva's birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shiva, in my opinion, is the most
rasta-like of the Hindu gods.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Shiva is pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shiva pops top.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shiva drinks bang.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shiva's got long ass hair and a huge ass
beard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And every celebration I've ever been
involved in and every sadhu, because
[SPEAKER_07]: there's many, many types of holy men in
India, many type of sadhu.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're not all Shivaites.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Brahmins and there's Krishnas and
there's Shivaites.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have a bunch of different schools.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't take long to figure out when
you go to India that the Shivaites are the
[SPEAKER_07]: poppers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So of course, the whole time I was there,
I was hanging out with Shivaite Babas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's an interesting fact that the
Jamaicans will love.
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys are revered in India.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're dreads.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're bearded.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're holy men.
[SPEAKER_07]: They walk around in bare feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't own things.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're revered by the people because
they live a harder life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the belief system in India with karma
and how karma works is that the sadhus are
[SPEAKER_07]: living this life to work through the karma
of the people, not just for themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the North American mentality when
it comes to karma is a selfish,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, as long as I'm nice, I'll have good
karma.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's not really how it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad karma can be trapped by good people
and good karma can be trapped by bad
[SPEAKER_07]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all one people on this earth and our
karmas are all interconnected.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not separated.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple more minutes, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I'm doing here, guys,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting the karma.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got a little herb water in the eye there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got two pieces of cardboard here.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was just explaining, the cardboard
to the guys behind us is going to soak the
[SPEAKER_06]: moisture that we leave and that is in the
hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll pull the moisture out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very important for here in Jamaica,
a desiccant.
[SPEAKER_07]: A desiccant is something that will absorb
moisture with the help of gravity.
[SPEAKER_07]: So cardboard is a desiccant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any paper, you can see if I put paper down
right here right now, obviously it would
[SPEAKER_07]: absorb the water off of the concrete.
[SPEAKER_07]: So cardboard is the same idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: We like to get a triple-plied cardboard.
[SPEAKER_07]: We use pizza boxes because we can close
them, wrap them in parchment paper and
[SPEAKER_07]: when we grate our bubble over top of it,
it's going to be safe from any contaminant
[SPEAKER_07]: like hair or debris or dust.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I mean by grating it or sieving it or
microplaning it, once we pull this resin
[SPEAKER_07]: out of here, it's going to be wet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very important that we,
probably the most important thing that
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll do in this whole process is that
we'll break that bubble hash up so it's
[SPEAKER_07]: powder.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the greater the surface area of powder
that we can spread, the more efficient the
[SPEAKER_07]: cardboard will be with its desiccant
action.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you put a little patty,
one little patty on a big piece of
[SPEAKER_07]: cardboard, yeah, that cardboard is going
to pull right under that patty.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll never dry properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, what if I broke that patty into
powder and spread it all over the
[SPEAKER_07]: cardboard?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in a place like Jamaica,
it doesn't take very long before that
[SPEAKER_07]: moisture is absorbed and then the resin is
able to cure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a small explanation of that is that the
wax membrane cuticle that holds in the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid profile in the glandular
trichome becomes brittle and we break it
[SPEAKER_07]: off and we separate the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, if it's fresher herb,
it's going to maintain hydration inside
[SPEAKER_07]: that wax membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's moisture in it, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you add more water to an already
moist membrane, you saturate it and it
[SPEAKER_07]: becomes harder to dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in Jamaica, in a place like this,
using dry herb can be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I still love to do fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait until we do fresh frozen
field.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fresh frozen field, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fresh frozen field.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you say we pull these bags pretty
soon, everybody?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so, pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got nice water right here,
John.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice and cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be able to do our rinses.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what we'll do, because it's very
important, potentially Ashley or someone,
[SPEAKER_07]: what we require is the hose being turned
on down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as we pull the bags and I clean
the hash out, someone's going to have to
[SPEAKER_07]: take the bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to clean the hash out.
[SPEAKER_07]: John's going to flip the bag inside out,
inside this bucket.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rinse the majority of the resin off of the
screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: But because of this heat and this
moisture, we need to ensure that the resin
[SPEAKER_07]: is cleaned off the screen properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So really pay attention with your eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there resin all over?
[SPEAKER_07]: That hose down there is unfortunately very
warm water.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you put your thumb over the hose and
create a real jet, you should be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: clean the bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to give you the bags
wrapped inside out over this bucket.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they'll be already stretched.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you won't have to hold a floppy bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be a nice open screen right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can hold the bag underneath,
you know, cinched, and just hold this
[SPEAKER_07]: sideways.
[SPEAKER_07]: And John can go down with you the first
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll definitely show you.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: You think we did 15, John?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then always keep the water cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: And clean, if you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't there a second ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then we'll definitely be rinsing it
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Little bud particles aren't really what
we're worried about.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the resin, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just think, I think we're going to have
to dump this into some lovely plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well,
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pulling bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pulling bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pulling our first bags in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we did, you know, make a little bit of
a mess on our first.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a little overzealous.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one 190 bag is very good to have.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though still I'm going to clean it as
much as I can rather than let this get
[SPEAKER_07]: into the final product.
[SPEAKER_07]: A great thing about water hash as well is
that, you know, often when people see it
[SPEAKER_07]: for the first time, they're surprised that
there's, you know, there's that you took
[SPEAKER_07]: all this herb and only got this small
amount of resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's the fact with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a small amount of resin and all
these people.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people when I got caught with my
cannabis, I have a cannabis felony.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got caught with 16 and a half pounds at
a roadblock.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the police just thought it was the
greatest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And luckily, they didn't catch me earlier
that day when I had a hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the 16 and a half pounds got taken.
[SPEAKER_07]: My cash got taken.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually being held for the BC
Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was herb for terminally sick people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't going to high school students
and it wasn't even a recreational thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the judge in Canada was really cool
about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He judged in a way that gave me no fine,
no time, no probation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he ordered the prosecutor to give me
my money back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And while I was being charged,
the prosecutor asked my lawyer if I could
[SPEAKER_07]: get their friend, who was dying of cancer
in the hospital, a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you get that?
[SPEAKER_07]: The prosecutor who was prosecuting me for
trafficking cannabis asked my lawyer to
[SPEAKER_07]: get his friend a bag of weed who was dying
in the hospital of cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course I did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course I'm going to show the guy that
just because you're unreasonable and you
[SPEAKER_07]: have such a shitty job, you have to
prosecute people for, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, the most righteous level of
cannabis distribution, you're distributing
[SPEAKER_07]: to terminally ill people.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, these people were really sick
back then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now luckily today in Canada, there's a
variety of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: John and I are clearly not terminally ill,
but we're still allowed to use cannabis as
[SPEAKER_07]: a medicine, which is fairly important to
the two of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the best part about pulling this bag is
how much ice is in there, what you're
[SPEAKER_06]: seeing here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, nice and cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that color, John?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's creamy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like creamy yellow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we see it creamy, we're happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're happy when we see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very happy when we see this color.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm almost happy of all the colors aside
from clear, clear states that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, this looks like soursap juice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what this looks like in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Soursap juice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we did something and we
didn't only do a mechanical separation,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is the process, but we've also
leached water soluble terpenes into this
[SPEAKER_07]: water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why we've got this color.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely keeping this ice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick thinking Johnny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny Quick Thinker.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have 8,000 nicknames.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pull it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay then.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, we're not talking about those
nicknames.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not talking about his nicknames.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just grabbing little bits and
pieces just because the quality of this,
[SPEAKER_07]: you never know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would I want to contaminate it with
little bits and pieces?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's quite a bit floating
around in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Water tap.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got this all nicely iced.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's pulling this bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have our desiccant here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to put our hash in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go around and I'm going to
show the boys this real quick.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is our contaminant bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a little bit of ice cubes
because John and I got a little
[SPEAKER_07]: overzealous on our mixing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of contaminant, but you can
tell that we filtered something out,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't what we want.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what we don't want.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people often ask, why do you,
why do you want to use that bag?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we need to get this out of our
smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't something that, that,
that we're going to be wanting to inhale.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now there are medicinal properties in
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could cook it into a banana bread.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could literally collect this stuff by
the kilo and give it to someone who makes
[SPEAKER_07]: medibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those medibles would be unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, John, we know that because
when we eat THC, what does it do in our
[SPEAKER_07]: body?
[SPEAKER_07]: We feed our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it metabolizes in our liver.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you eat cannabis, it's different
from smoking it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually will go through your liver and
it metabolizes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what it does is it turns a
tetrahydroxane for cannabinol,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is THC, into 11-hydroxymetabolite.
[SPEAKER_07]: And anyone that's ever eaten cannabis,
that stuff will lick you good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it will put you down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is very different from smoking
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you can get people who smoke a
bunch and have a minor anxiety attack and
[SPEAKER_07]: are very intense.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nothing compared to the power of
eating or overeating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I eat a lot of cannabis and I haven't for
the last 24 hours, actually three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course I'm eating this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well you eat a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not you I'm talking about,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is our 190.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just pull that ice cube out if you
get a chance there.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so 190.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once again, you can see all the resin
on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to do an inside out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to do an inside out of here?
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stretch that right over the top.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cinch it on the bottom and then we'll just
stick it in the water and get that screen
[SPEAKER_07]: as clean as we can.
[SPEAKER_07]: We might be able to get them clean enough
here if you use your hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an extremely important part.
[SPEAKER_07]: Use your eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Use a microscope if you have to.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's stuff on the screen and if you
leave it there, each time it's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: dry and it's going to fill the holes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And once you've eventually filled the
holes on the screen, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: throwing pounds of weed in and getting
very, very, very small returns because
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not making it through the screens.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can fix this by taking some over proof
alcohol, clear alcohol and rubbing gently.
[SPEAKER_07]: I use a toothbrush.
[SPEAKER_07]: I flip the bag over a screen and make it
tight and then I just use a toothbrush
[SPEAKER_07]: with the smallest amount of solvents.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you guys know, I am not a solvent fan.
[SPEAKER_07]: I say it all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Water sustains life and solvents end life.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Water sustains life on earth and solvents
end life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: 160?
[SPEAKER_07]: 160.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we got a pile, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_07]: And right away it's this orangey,
redy, awesome, beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's nice 160.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see it moving around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a little process that I use almost
panning.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to bounce it around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to pick itself up off the
screen and get these little shaking
[SPEAKER_07]: processes.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the 160.
[SPEAKER_07]: So by no means is this what we want,
but I'll tell you to get that quality is a
[SPEAKER_07]: good sign.
[SPEAKER_07]: It only means that our 120 bag that I'm
about to go pull right now is only going
[SPEAKER_07]: to be better.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is basically nicer than any gun you
could find on the entire island because I
[SPEAKER_07]: washed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not an ego thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that they're smashing resins
with knives and I washed the resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have the microscope?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we could really show these guys
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right beside you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go over on this side, you'll see
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see systolic hairs, stigmas,
capricate stocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not so much actual plant matter,
but trichome contamination.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to use a little bit of this
water just to kind of rehydrate that resin
[SPEAKER_07]: that I allowed to.
[SPEAKER_07]: In this heat, this resin will dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can always rehydrate it by adding
more water onto the screen to get it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, when we use an ice cold water
underneath.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now after this bag, we wash the other bags
back into the other bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to keep collecting that resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: After this bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: This bag is not a good enough resin for us
yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked at it under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably only 40% gland heads.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: 60 to 70% contaminant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great for eating.
Great for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're 100% right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is great for eating.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not something we're going to put
in our pie.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not being snobs or vigorous.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like you'd say the same thing
with a good piece of fruit as opposed to a
[SPEAKER_07]: bad piece of fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: A perfectly ripe banana is something
that's wonderful to eat in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one that's like overly ripe and almost
rotten.
[SPEAKER_07]: I prefer that to give that to my wife and
she makes banana bread out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's different levels of qualities.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fruit that we're looking for is
the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting that slow drip on the 120 is never
a bad sign.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we want to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I need to show you guys each time
because you're going to see the different
[SPEAKER_07]: quality and you're going to see that the
resin moves around different and it cleans
[SPEAKER_07]: different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as it gets better, as it gets better,
I'll be able to basically roll this
[SPEAKER_07]: around.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a tricky sort of thing that I've
learned over the years.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I need a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had a little spray bottle,
I could spray it all into the center and
[SPEAKER_07]: make it easier to collect.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you were off screen, I gave the two
thumbs up because that's a nice ball of
[SPEAKER_06]: resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know you're excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not even at the 90.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, a ball of resin like this
could easily be two to three grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks very small, but resin is
extremely dense.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, that looks awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a feeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course, we're now looking at it,
which you guys have all seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's all the fresh heavies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hence, his company.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good start.
[SPEAKER_07]: I came here in 2002.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my friend from Seaford town is a
German descent, a white Jamaican guy,
[SPEAKER_07]: born and bred, his whole family.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go see him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he had a pound of herb that he was
selling to an ex-pat in Negril,
[SPEAKER_07]: who was the coin man.
[SPEAKER_07]: He used to cut coins and make them look
like someone was smoking a joint inside
[SPEAKER_07]: the coin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Chris would sell him a pound of herb
for $50.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'd bring it down from the hills.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the day that I came to Jamaica and
met Chris, the coin man told him that the
[SPEAKER_07]: herb was no good and that he wouldn't pay
him the $50.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Chris had already invested his own
money to get the herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he had bought it for maybe $30 or
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: But $30 was a lot of money to Chris.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was going to mess him up for about a
week and a half if he didn't get it taken
[SPEAKER_07]: care of.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was really bummed out.
[SPEAKER_07]: The herb wasn't very nice, but I took the
herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I turned it into 11 grams of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he sold it to the coin man for $220
US.
[SPEAKER_07]: The same pound of herb the coin man
wouldn't buy for $50 US.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we took it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We made hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took us 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Chris went from losing $30 to making
$190.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me tell you, Chris was pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so was the coin man until he found
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wasn't super happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the Jamaican spritzer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, I'm learning something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're learning something.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just created something.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how it happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your hands dirty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make hash with your friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear to God, you'll learn things.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something I haven't done before,
actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked great.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, we learn something new every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to just borrow that.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, you can have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now at this point, we're going to wash
this bag into this resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to harvest this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a big change now.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not putting resin that was 90% heads
and that looks like something we all want
[SPEAKER_07]: to smoke into this bucket, which is
clearly going to be washed into the
[SPEAKER_07]: garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to wash it right back in to
the 90 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what that's going to do for us is it's
going to try to wrap those resin heads
[SPEAKER_07]: that were on this screen in our next
screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to keep those resin heads
because they're actually very nice,
[SPEAKER_07]: which sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so this is my favorite bag,
the 90 micron black bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: This bag is always just great.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's very little in this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what we got there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, there it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hiding in the foam.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is something that will happen
sometimes with bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll get foam.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you kind of can't tell what you have.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to give it a little blow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a
[SPEAKER_07]: small amount of 90 means we're going to
get a big pull on the 73.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was expecting at least twice this much
of 90.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it all went into the 73,
John.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say this as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we were dealing with sativas here,
if there were sativas in the bunch,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going to find a large amount of
heads in this white bag, the 45 micron
[SPEAKER_07]: bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's due to the fact that the
tropical sun beats such powerful UVB rays
[SPEAKER_07]: down on this resin that it produces almost
a smaller trichome rather than the large
[SPEAKER_07]: bulbous ones that John and I are used to
pulling off of indoor grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: The sativas, particularly the outdoor
ones, will tend to pull much smaller,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be like, we should leave it just
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because it'll self press.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll self press.
[SPEAKER_07]: Normally when I'm doing this as well,
these right here would be in a cold
[SPEAKER_07]: environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if this was full of ice, we would
have it open and we would have this down
[SPEAKER_07]: inside of the ice mixture and it would
just keep a sort of thermal climb from,
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's got to be 27 to 26 degrees
out here right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's definitely nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that the resin doesn't always
appreciate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got these cold packs that put them in
ice, like freezing perfectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to put these in here and do
exactly what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually brought this with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw that down right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to clean this bag out?
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a little trick we learned in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we were doing that in Spain.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to admit I have done that before
Spain, but he just had the perfect size
[SPEAKER_07]: bucket that I loved.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Phil, actually even before I went,
actually before we went to Spain,
[SPEAKER_07]: we made hash with the bucket on the side
of the river.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Chica Miss River up in Whistler,
British Columbia, raging glacier fed river
[SPEAKER_07]: behind me and John.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do we do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we bring a bunch of his fresh frozen
buds and some bubble bags and ice and we
[SPEAKER_07]: make hash down by the river.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was quite nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, look at this.
[SPEAKER_07]: The water came right out of the 90 micron
bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is the water not falling through this
screen right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: What possible reasons could it be?
[SPEAKER_07]: Full of resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's full of resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can stand here like an idiot for 20
minutes and let it drain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you could simply go,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm jerking the resin with a quick jerk up
off of the screen and the water is rushing
[SPEAKER_07]: down through the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I literally had customers who,
with this bag, one guy in particular,
[SPEAKER_07]: he said it took him 32 hours to drain the
bag and I was just like, Oh, what did you
[SPEAKER_07]: do for 30?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, well, I hung it on the bathroom
door knob and with the bucket underneath
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when I showed him that I could
drain any bag in 10 seconds, he absolutely
[SPEAKER_07]: did not believe me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I finally showed him how to do
it, well, the guy just felt so stupid and
[SPEAKER_07]: you shouldn't feel stupid.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, man, in my opinion, the only way
you can learn is to put yourself out
[SPEAKER_07]: there, look like an idiot, make mistakes
and learn from them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, holy shit, how do we learn?
[SPEAKER_07]: We make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I learn anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hands don't fall in 2018.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the biggest yield I've seen out of
anything I've done.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really nice 73 pull right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you get goosebumps, you guys,
look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Goosebumps from that resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the hair standing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't see a single thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get the microscope out once
the camera's off and we'll all get to look
[SPEAKER_07]: at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: For now, I want to pull it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always nice to pull a really nice bag
to show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_05]: More goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_06]: My hairs are standing up on my arm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is 10 grams, I would say.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a 10 gram pull.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we didn't even use all the bump.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need another screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know that 45 is going to be
the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be the same again.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so nice to see you just so stoked in
our bubble games.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to show them the goosebumps and the
hair standing up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we came here, to see and to
show you guys exactly what you can do.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's clean that off into the 45.
[SPEAKER_07]: We only have two bags left.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be getting down to the fun stuff
here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people make mistakes when they do
this for the first time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so exciting when you see what John
and I just saw for the first time,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially, that sometimes the bags don't
get cleaned fast enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes they get put down and everyone's
like, oh, look at the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, just do me a favor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the hash once you've cleaned your
bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clean your bags and then look at the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 7390 and the 45, because it's so
small, it's going to get stuck in those
[SPEAKER_06]: screens and you've got to get it cleaned
right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most important part.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're all important,
but really pay attention to your 90,
[SPEAKER_06]: your 73 because of what those are your
favorite bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this one's going to be heavy.
[SPEAKER_07]: 45 is always holding the water nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bucket me up when you get a chance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is probably like twice as much
as the 73 unless it's just all water,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's definitely the same size once
this water drips down.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I had to get another pressing
screen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually had to change my game right
away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, okay, I need another screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we're adaptable, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy Moses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as he started doing that, I was about
ready to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually blow the foam off to the
side.
[SPEAKER_07]: One at a time, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I just thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So nice little 45 pull.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's going to dry even faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the one.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the two bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to walk around and show you
all, but you guys are all going to be able
[SPEAKER_07]: to see it on the pressing screen once
we've got it collected.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a nice pile.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually not quite as much as the 73,
but it's pretty, pretty chunky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clean, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is this is what the water offers us.
[SPEAKER_07]: The water offers us the ability to clean
the resin in a way that we've never been
[SPEAKER_07]: able to before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll tell you, Jamaica was one of the
first countries I came to to show this
[SPEAKER_07]: process to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went to a lot of countries like 99.
[SPEAKER_07]: I came in 2000, 2001.
[SPEAKER_07]: 2002, three, four and five.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some of those first bags were
posted on your Facebook page by someone
[SPEAKER_06]: from here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got I got good friends in Orange
Hill, Ziggy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got good friends in Grange Hill that
we've made bubble hash with over the
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, some really good people, some really
good growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, these guys aren't.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's lots of different kind of growers
in Jamaica, just like there's lots of
[SPEAKER_07]: different kind of growers everywhere in
the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: But to find the real rootsy growers,
to find the real you know, the the guys
[SPEAKER_07]: that are really focused on the effects of
the plant, not on how much they're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to get from a tourist market, which
there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if I lived in Jamaica,
I'd be selling the shit out of hash to
[SPEAKER_07]: tourists.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't even be funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I tour here, I'm going to sell me
the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it would be great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, when I arrived here,
the first thing I had to do was go find
[SPEAKER_07]: ganja and turn it into hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: How happy would I have been if someone met
me at the airport and said, oh,
[SPEAKER_07]: man, we've been making hash with your
bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a couple hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like really, I mean, the first thing we
landed, we got to get hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to keep in mind, John and I have
licenses for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally have a license to have ten
pounds of hash at my house.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm allowed ten pounds of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you allowed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Fifteen?
[SPEAKER_07]: Fifteen point five.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fifteen point five pounds over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten pounds over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Between the two of us, we rock a 25 pack
of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: How sweet is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like we know how big.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Soon, the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I personally consider myself an
earthling.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really a big proponent of borders
and division of human culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the fact that we have our own
cultures, but they're all of our cultures
[SPEAKER_07]: to share.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not separated in any way.
[SPEAKER_07]: One more bag, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the bag everyone hates.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we run the 20 gallons, you see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to see what the Sativa bag
looks like because of the smaller size of
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's full.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's full.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're drinking.
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter which way you look at it,
this is all useful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not too big on the 190, but you know
what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I will eat it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get us some cups.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're all going to have a drink of
this liquid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're going to love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turpentine rich cannabis liquid.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to get any of you high.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to be like drinking
cannabis tea.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know a few of you are going to be
inspired by it, at least.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as everybody knows, you always see me
drinking my tea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a nice thing to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feed it to my plants, personally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, these are flavors and terpenes and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just seems like a good idea to just
put them right back into what you don't
[SPEAKER_07]: drink.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I mean, obviously, John's not
going to drink five gallons of bubble hash
[SPEAKER_07]: water because he makes bubble hash almost
every day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about bottling it there for a
while.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so last little tip on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys have already seen me doing
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: These bags are a little harder to finish
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want you squeezing the fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want, you know, we don't want to
bruise the resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to damage it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're going to do is we're going
to create, we just open the bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we create air in the bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we use the air to force the rest
of the water and the foam out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is very helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'll allow you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you have your resin soaking in water,
let's get it out as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're teaching and educating here today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going real slow.
[SPEAKER_07]: But generally you'd see me, I'd already
have this over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This would have already been in the house
and microplanned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we would have already done a lot of
this, but we're going slow because we're
[SPEAKER_07]: in Jamaica and we're teaching people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not in a rush.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're teaching people.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: This little pile of 25.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is our last batch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to get a really good
bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just pull it over the bucket and
exposes it right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark's really experienced.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we hold it in his hand and just cut it
off with a spoon.
[SPEAKER_06]: But really reality to make life a lot
easier for you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see what he's doing here right
now, he pulls it over a bucket and then
[SPEAKER_06]: you have access to that resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to blow on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost done.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we get a real nice, almost artistic
resin mixed with the white foam that I
[SPEAKER_07]: created.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because I gave it a little bit of a
blow, I created these psychedelic patterns
[SPEAKER_07]: inside the resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see here and here how easy it is
to see the contaminant.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you get rid of all the contaminant,
even if you have 1%, it sticks out like a
[SPEAKER_07]: sore thumb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Generally nothing will get through these
bags, but the way John and I, the way I
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't fold the bags over themselves right
away and we were stripping the herb,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was falling between the bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had a little bit of a upset there,
but nothing major.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing major.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to see, we're going to look
at all of these under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll actually photograph them all right
now with my camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's a little bit easier
than looking through that tiny little eye
[SPEAKER_07]: hole and we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: see them.
So we're going to look at them all right
now with my camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: what I would consider the best everywhere
I go, but for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_07]: and John's gonna be on this, man,
I'm so excited for you to join us here
[SPEAKER_07]: soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have smoked Jamaican bubble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that too, bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I got to smoke Jamaican bud before
we actually did this, and you guys saw me
[SPEAKER_06]: working here hard, going solid,
and I did tweak my neck a little bit,
[SPEAKER_06]: but otherwise not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely amazing medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the difference between,
why I love having John here with me,
[SPEAKER_07]: is because we're not really just promoting
the new forever values of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: which I am 100% a proponent on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe in using cannabis spiritually,
in the sense that the same way it is
[SPEAKER_07]: medicinal for your body, it is medicinal
for your brain, and for your soul,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the synergy of those three things.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Holy Trinity, that's my Holy Trinity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm gonna, what do you think,
do a little, get that last little bit on?
[SPEAKER_06]: Last little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you can do a second run from that,
and I can guarantee we get more from that
[SPEAKER_06]: run.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true, we could literally take this,
put it back into the bags, mix it again
[SPEAKER_07]: for 10 or 15 minutes, and we could get
more.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not tell you to throw that away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, as you do this, as you start
making this, especially here in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_07]: I could easily see, with the way my mind
works, that I would set up a thing where
[SPEAKER_07]: all the firsts is like one team of people,
and then this is the second team.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not run by the first team.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a team of people who are doing
the jobs that John and I did, and then you
[SPEAKER_07]: have specific experts who will deal with
this product right here, because let's be
[SPEAKER_07]: honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people you would have taken care
of that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, the big job is breaking up the
hash into powder and drying it properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like a foreman job.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a supervisor.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy's getting paid more than everyone
else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the laborers.
[SPEAKER_07]: The laborers, they're just anyone,
any laborer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you just saw what we did.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just really simple labor.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're moving around water and ice.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're mixing with a stick, or you've got
washing machines.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got washing machines,
you're using a bag like this that's all
[SPEAKER_07]: screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole bag is screen, and it zips
closed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I throw the ice and the herb in.
[SPEAKER_07]: You throw it in the washing machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You turn the button.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten minutes later, another guy washes
that, drains that washing machine into a
[SPEAKER_07]: set of buckets and starts doing what we
did.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could have one machine and run three
20-gallon sets of bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three machines, nine 20-gallon sets of
bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might have four people constantly
making ice, breaking it up, and filling
[SPEAKER_07]: bags in these all-screen bags,
and then putting them in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you have your second crew coming
along, opening the freezer, opening those,
[SPEAKER_07]: putting them into the washing machine,
and turning them on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: The third crew is pulling bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not just laborers.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are people you've trained,
and these are people who know what they're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to get to this and this part
right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where guys like John and I come in
to train specific people.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need a hyper-aware individual.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need someone that is aware of their
surroundings in a hyper-aware way,
[SPEAKER_07]: not someone that's just doing the job and
all, cut it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be done specifically.
[SPEAKER_07]: For this particular job, you've got to
hire someone that's OCD or anal.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just like, I want this to be ...
It has to be perfect, because if you don't
[SPEAKER_07]: have that person, this is going to mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to leave moisture in your
hash, and you're basically going to turn
[SPEAKER_07]: it to garbage, especially if you start
making it on a large scale, especially if
[SPEAKER_07]: you start producing pounds of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got this.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I want to do now is we're going to
have a little sip of this water.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take this inside,
and we're going to ... I guess we could
[SPEAKER_07]: break it up over cardboard, and that'll
start the drying process.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll probably leave it on the cardboard
for two to three days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although tonight, in the next 20 to 30
minutes, I will hand-press a piece,
[SPEAKER_07]: India-style, and I will get as much of the
moisture out as we can, and then we're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to plug in the D-nail, and we're
going to do Jamaican Doves, a full-milk
[SPEAKER_07]: bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Full-milk bubble Jamaican Doves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get some cups and drink some of this
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab a seat, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and the music just came on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry we didn't film us drinking the
juice, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone was pretty blown away by the
process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, happy times here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here in Jamaica, we self-pressed out a
little tiny bit, because, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are we not going to try some?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, ready for a Jamaican bubble dab,
John?
[SPEAKER_06]: So excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a 73.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I call my medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I say every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this 73 is by far the best 73 I ever
saw.
[SPEAKER_06]: You saw the goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a little excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm always happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is exciting, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little bit of difference between
always being happy and being excited to
[SPEAKER_06]: try something so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: First time, first trip.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, this is something I'll never
forget.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow and steady, buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's moist, so we've got to get through
that little bit of water hit first.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's starting to...
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that feeling?
[SPEAKER_07]: Turning in the air.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like half the hash that I pulled
off you just got.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we came here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are resin chasers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely needs to be dry,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we always say, we got to try it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you just nailed that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom!
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could actually put a little water in
the bottle, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, next right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we need to put something that's dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's something we do quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get excited, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't even hit it with water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: The first water hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone that wants to hit it, we can hit it
off camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: So John and I are going to keep at it
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to keep smoking the full-milk
Jamaican bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is day one, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: We wrapped it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just popped a bunch of that fresh 73.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dabbed it up on the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone loved it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We gave them all nice little doses.
[SPEAKER_07]: They fed us this wonderful soup that they
actually put breadfruit in from the tree
[SPEAKER_07]: behind us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched them cut it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They came out with dinner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very special.
[SPEAKER_07]: First day in Jamaica has been absolutely
top-notch.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just completely off the charts.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, having Rich and Spice pick us up
at the airport.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just coming and hooking up with
these other guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a good day, let's just say.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to see you guys tomorrow
on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep watching.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: Bubble Man and Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the hissy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just chilling out now at the Spanish
Court Hotel.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of the pretty nice hotels in
downtown Kingston.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it would actually be Uptown.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uptown is up this way, and it's sort of
where the nicer houses are.
[SPEAKER_07]: You drive up the mountain into the Blue
Mountain Range, and you get this golf
[SPEAKER_07]: course up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fancy houses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to turn the music down because
it's crapping out on me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys will probably hear us a little
better if we don't have that going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Johnny and I came up here to do a
little bit of video editing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We puffed a few bowls out of the hitman.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have the screen, John?
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who found it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who found it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I spilt it, even though I didn't
see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see anything move, but yeah,
we have one screen, so we can't really
[SPEAKER_07]: mess around with it in the way that losing
it would be fairly detrimental.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have the mothership and the D-nail
here, which is upstairs in the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were hitting that earlier after we made
some bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a nice group of guys that we had
never met before.
[SPEAKER_07]: After we got picked up at the airport,
we went and met some other guys,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we went and made some nice bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some killer bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we got about a pound of herb that we
ran through the five-gallon bucket,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we got an incredible return.
[SPEAKER_04]: 73, baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: The 73 kicked ass, I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wearing the 90 shirt.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was a contest, I lost the game
tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: 73 won.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no contest, but 73 was epic.
[SPEAKER_07]: The 73 is and was epic, so we're going to
be... I photographed the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll show you guys what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, what a great first night in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's past great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's memorable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something you put down in my history
books because...
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit like this just doesn't happen in John
Bruffalo's world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to happen all the time when
you're out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the people who are looking for the
education really want to know what's going
[SPEAKER_06]: on and try to take a better look at
medicine for patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really, really, really interesting is
that everybody here, the people I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: talking to, they're looking at epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big one.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really curious because they have
friends and family that are sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were talking and they don't know what
to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best part about it is, hey,
smoke the herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, smoke the herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Feed your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_07]: John and I are going to be at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, John actually told me today,
which I was really stoked on.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like, you know, we landed at the
airport at 1 o'clock, 1.30 by the time we
[SPEAKER_07]: cleared the airport.
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually could say we were in Jamaica
and cleared customs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a great experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: We land, we get picked up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Within how many hours?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where were we smoking hash that we made?
[SPEAKER_02]: At 640, the hash was being run and we were
hit the D-nail by a 0730.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, once again, sure,
I don't love to promote hitting the super
[SPEAKER_07]: wet bubble, but I'll tell you,
when you fly your ass to Kingston,
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamaica, and you link up with some iry
dudes that want to make some kind bud
[SPEAKER_07]: turned into isolated resin glands,
and it turns out as well as it turned out
[SPEAKER_07]: for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, right after finishing,
the chef made us some breadfruit stew from
[SPEAKER_07]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched him go outside with a cut down
saying, what's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes, breadfruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Walked away, he's picking up some other
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of like a dumpling or a potato.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you haven't had it, check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: One more cool thing I'm going to try.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been to Jamaica many, many times.
[SPEAKER_07]: John's first trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm kind of trying to like,
every day I want John to like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, tomorrow for breakfast,
John's going to have ackee, which is,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, a very popular plant here in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: Huge tree, pink fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That opens up, splits with these three
black seeds, and within those you get this
[SPEAKER_07]: yellowish, egg-like looking substance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Scrambled eggs, in fact.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to check it out tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everywhere I go, there's fruit,
mangoes, and all these different fruits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Papaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: Papaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice berries.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got something to say to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Mark said when I got here,
I was going to say I was going to live
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm going to eat fruit here every day.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We barely tapped into the epic fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be on that for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow, I don't think we're going to
waste any time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're probably going to get out to a ganja
field.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to create a new term for you
guys out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the FFF, which is Fresh Frozen Field
Run.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fresh Frozen Field Run.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're going to be doing Fresh Frozen
Field Runs, and I hope you guys can join
[SPEAKER_07]: us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you guys keep watching Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out John's channel, John H.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfello.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can check him out on YouTube,
and thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate you more than you can
imagine.
We'll see you next time.
