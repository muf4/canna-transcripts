[SPEAKER_03]: What we have inside here is a show
showcasing some of the most incredible
[SPEAKER_03]: glass blowing artists from around North
America.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an incredible collection of head
pieces that are usually carefully
[SPEAKER_03]: protected that have been brought up here
by hand by most of these artists who are
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely thrilled to be in Canada where
their pieces can be shown as the
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible art that they are rather than
being persecuted as drug device peddlers,
[SPEAKER_03]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: So come on inside and have a look at this
incredible event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, because you never could hold
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That moment is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really magnetic moment because it's
like you can touch the glass and feel the
[SPEAKER_01]: texture and like feel the form in your
hand and understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives you a whole new understanding
of the glass, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like there's one thing to look
at the glass, but run your finger around
[SPEAKER_06]: the surface to feel it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because some glass is purposely
non-smooth, some of it is purposely
[SPEAKER_06]: totally smooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shades of copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you're a glassblower and you
stare at a piece of glass while you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working it, we have a different
perception.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at the wall thickness in a way
that I don't think normal people normally
[SPEAKER_01]: look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: To hold that piece and feel the technical,
it's Chris McElroy.
[SPEAKER_06]: My man, what's the deal?
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris.
[SPEAKER_06]: So your piece, you have a wall hanging
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last thing, I have not put it up,
but I don't know how to put it up without
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you want to take it down to here.
I missed
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still have enough?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
I'm going to throw my jar in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's our door guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there he is.
So
[SPEAKER_03]: we are sitting here with the infamous
marble slinger.
[SPEAKER_03]: The artist and organizer who is
responsible for all of this chaos here
[SPEAKER_03]: tonight, although the chaos seems to be
getting under control.
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you created?
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of a beast is this that you've
built?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't really build anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to actually bring together
kind of a whole movement that's sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: been an invisible culture for a long time,
which I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of calling the glass pipe art
movement, for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's basically a bunch of artists that
express themselves using lampwork
[SPEAKER_01]: borosilicate glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they make lots of different stuff,
but a lot of us got involved with glass or
[SPEAKER_01]: express ourselves through really intricate
glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just putting that together in the
setting of an art show to honor these pipe
[SPEAKER_01]: makers as artists and check out in one
place all the different styles and
[SPEAKER_01]: aesthetics that have developed in the art
scene, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: The couple of blowers that I've chatted
with so far seem so stoked to have
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody want to showcase their work and
showcase them as artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few people seem a bit chuffed,
and that's fucking excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the thing is a lot of people are
just unaware that this whole culture
[SPEAKER_01]: exists and that glass pipes have gotten to
a point where they're more than just
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's functional, but they're
used as a medium of artistic expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of other functional objects have been
used throughout many different cultures
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout history of people expressing
themselves artistically through a
[SPEAKER_01]: functional object.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been expressing themselves
through pipes throughout history in all
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Native Americans made pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: African tribes made different types of
pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were a lot of the first examples
of cultural artwork or folk art.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just another part of that
historical cultural cycle, a culture that
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot stems from Grateful Dead culture and
the Grateful Dead lot and people just
[SPEAKER_01]: making small fun functional pipes of being
inspired by lots of different aspects to
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make them more decorative and
express themselves through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually really interesting to ask
each individual their motivation of why
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to make a pipe in the first
place, because a lot of these people are
[SPEAKER_01]: people who could have such a high level of
proficiency with the medium of glass and
[SPEAKER_01]: are also getting to a point expressing
themselves as artists where they could
[SPEAKER_01]: easily not make it a functional pipe and
they could market themselves to a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: different audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the more mainstream just
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, there's the
complications of things like Operation
[SPEAKER_01]: Pipe Dreams and John Ashcroft and the
whole gray area of legality that makes you
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder why would artists that have such
visions and have such skill levels with
[SPEAKER_01]: this glass want to still make it so it
could function as a pipe?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's... What is your answer to that
question for yourself as an artist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I got into glass the idea of
making a functional pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the function of the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I started playing with as an artist,
I was an artist before I got into medium
[SPEAKER_01]: of glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I discovered the medium of glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at it really more at first as a
craft and as a way that I could just
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly make a living by creating
something with my hands and selling it as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to having a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at first it was more a monetary thing
and I was interested in the medium and
[SPEAKER_01]: learning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making pipes enabled me to... Every
time I made a pipe, that was a lesson in
[SPEAKER_01]: lamp working glass and understanding how
the glass flows and blowing the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I could... Pipe was a very
sellable thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I can sell that, I could afford to
buy more materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could afford to buy... To keep myself
going with the medium was very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The glass materials that have the overhead
of a glass shop to every aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to actually have a kiln and the
torches and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's before you even created
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it is is every single pipe was a
lesson in learning how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the roots of the glass that we use is
more in a scientific thing Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: we use borosilicate glass, which people
know as Pyrex, which is just a brand name
[SPEAKER_01]: for borosilicate glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditionally, the borosilicate glass...
There's lots of different types of glass
[SPEAKER_01]: that are used for different reasons to
create different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, some people... The most
common form of glass blowing is blowing
[SPEAKER_01]: out of a furnace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could blow very large stuff by
gathering big gathers of already hot
[SPEAKER_01]: molten glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that glass works at a lower
temperature so it can stay molten.
[SPEAKER_01]: The glass we use is harder glass that
works at a hotter temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you use Pyrex plates in a microwave or
you can use them... They're cook safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also used in laboratories and
bunsen burners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditionally, they're used mostly for
scientific apparatus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides that, artistically, you've
probably seen people lamp working
[SPEAKER_01]: borosilicate glass maybe in a mall or at a
carnival.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making mostly little types of trinkets or
at Disney World making Donald ducks and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mickey mouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just in the last, I'd say,
25 years or even less that people have
[SPEAKER_01]: started using this actual type of working
glass and this type of glass to express
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves more artistically as opposed to
scientifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly enough, the reason that
pipes use this type of glass is because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the function.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use a lighter and light
the pipe constantly, if it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: softer type of glass, not borosilicate,
but a different type like furnace glass,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will crack eventually due to stress of
having too much heat on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this type of glass we use to create
functional pipes comes from a scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as pipe makers and people inspired by
everything, everyone has their own
[SPEAKER_01]: inspirations, so I can't speak for
everyone, but a lot of us trace our roots
[SPEAKER_01]: to a man named Bob Snodgrass, who is one
of the first people that was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to put some kind of coloration in
the pipes using gold and silver fuming,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the famous color changing pipe
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was also involved in going on tour with
the Grateful Dead and selling his small
[SPEAKER_01]: color changing pipes there on the Grateful
Dead lot, which got a whole psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: culture interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: More at first through the function,
but then if you think about what people
[SPEAKER_01]: were smoking through those pipes and about
that sort of the Grateful Dead scene and
[SPEAKER_01]: the artistic movement surrounding that,
that just bled over to pipes and young
[SPEAKER_01]: people who want to be artists,
who want to work for themselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe don't want to get a job,
they're done touring with the dead,
[SPEAKER_01]: they went to people like Bob Snodgrass and
the people he taught and that culture
[SPEAKER_01]: spread to other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more it spread, the more people
got ideas to try to make something more.
[SPEAKER_01]: These little pipes that Snoddy and his
predecessors made were treasured little
[SPEAKER_01]: items by people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was fun to try to come up with
new aesthetics and new ways and be unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people started putting their
signatures on them and coming with their
[SPEAKER_01]: own styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, it's just going off where
now if you come forward another 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_01]: years from when Snodgrass started putting
that stuff on the dead lot, we have all
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of actual companies that are
creating torches and new types of color
[SPEAKER_01]: glass that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The color and pattern the glass and all
sorts of different techniques from other
[SPEAKER_01]: styles of working glass are now being
incorporated by these young people and
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulated into these pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a huge social aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an economic piece of it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge economic piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from, it doesn't just stem to
the paraphernalia industry and people
[SPEAKER_01]: selling glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes even, it goes before that,
the prequel of that are the companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: are making the color glass and the
companies that are making the torches,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've gotten to a point where they're
actually, they shied away at first because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the controversy of the idea of the
culture of making glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're realizing now that that is
what their biggest market is and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing directly to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about the people who make the
materials we use, the technical stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: the torches, the color glass, the raw
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're marketing directly to the pipe
makers because the pipe makers are a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of their market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the reality of it at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the industry, it's like anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is interconnected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pipe scene does not exist in and of
itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that this show tonight is
significant in the way that it could be a
[SPEAKER_03]: shift in the way that glass artists are
perceived, the way that they're perceived
[SPEAKER_03]: and the way that they're exposed to the
public as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that we might start to see
more of a trend of glass artists being
[SPEAKER_03]: showcased as artists rather than next to
the rolling papers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're at all successful at that,
then we have accomplished our mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to give a lot of props and thanks
out to another glass artist, a friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine named Brian McCauley, who signed his
pieces as GASP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2003, March, it was March 9th,
I think, 2003, he threw the first ever
[SPEAKER_01]: glass pipe art show in a gallery down in
San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually called The Melting Point
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the inspiration for the name of
this place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had the same idea amongst us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually a peer of mine and we went
to art school together and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we knew each other before we even
blew glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, his vision was the same as
what we were talking here of like removing
[SPEAKER_01]: them from the setting of next to cannabis
magazines and next to rolling papers and
[SPEAKER_01]: next to things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see, the idea is we're trying to have
people focus on the art.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that it functions as a pipe,
honestly, is secondary to these artists,
[SPEAKER_01]: including myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you surround these pieces in
just other paraphernalia and propaganda
[SPEAKER_01]: that's due to cannabis, it's not
necessarily that I'm against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily I'm for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what that just says is that this piece
is used for cannabis and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole other issue that I'm not
trying to tackle in this statement here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm trying to say is by putting
the pipes on pedestals, by putting them
[SPEAKER_01]: next to other art pieces in an art
gallery, having an actual art opening
[SPEAKER_01]: that's catered where the artists have
their titles or their names, where they
[SPEAKER_01]: make an artist statement, that all is
putting the pipes in a context that other
[SPEAKER_01]: art traditionally has been put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, it validates these pieces
as art and not just pretty paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where my friend Brian,
a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gasp, was starting that in San Francisco
in 2003.
[SPEAKER_01]: He conceived this idea for his show before
Operation Pipe Dreams happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about Operation Pipe Dreams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that everybody necessarily
knows exactly what the parameters of that
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Operation Pipe Dreams is the name of it
was actually two operations, Operation
[SPEAKER_01]: Pipe Dreams and Operation Headhunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were particular initiatives,
a working in collaboration, the DEA,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Department of Justice and a bunch of
other government officials launched a full
[SPEAKER_01]: federal investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, a roundup where they ended up
arresting 51 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The date that they actually announced and
launched it was February 24, 2003.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a whole bunch of different
companies that were advertising openly on
[SPEAKER_01]: the internet to sell things like glass
water pipes and glass pieces and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were paying taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought they were staying within the
law by saying they wouldn't sell to people
[SPEAKER_01]: under no minors, no one under 18 of age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could purchase their products and they
were for tobacco use only, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without any warning at all, the DEA and
the Department of Justice kicked down the
[SPEAKER_01]: doors of these people, seized a lot of
their property and their businesses and
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze their assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tommy Chong, who was one of the people
involved in his business, his son is
[SPEAKER_01]: running a business called Chong Glass,
got arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually the one person that ended up
in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of other people on house arrest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the more notable people I can
remember off the top of my head that got
[SPEAKER_01]: busted were Jerome Baker, Bongs,
or Waterpipes, excuse me, and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know, a bunch of different companies,
but 101 North.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was basically, the federal
government has a definition of
[SPEAKER_01]: paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like in the United
States, there's just a lot of huge gray
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the federal government decided to
act on their definition and enforce what
[SPEAKER_01]: they thought was the law in terms of
defining these pieces of drug
[SPEAKER_01]: paraphernalia, even though these people
thought they were within the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what they did was,
if anyone was curious about whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: glass pipes or paraphernalia was legal or
illegal, they were trying to establish
[SPEAKER_01]: that these things were illegal,
but it's still a gray area, because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's still people obviously arguing
that they're either for our purposes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're for tobacco purposes, they're for
legal herb purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the risk has increased for blowers in
the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well basically what they've done is the
federal government has said that federally
[SPEAKER_01]: it's against the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state laws are all individual and
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So state by state things are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things they were going after at
first mostly, pipe drains, was interstate
[SPEAKER_01]: trafficking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people who were like, basically they
wanted people with a lot of money who were
[SPEAKER_01]: sending stuff from one state to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the federal government's doing at
this point, they actually launched another
[SPEAKER_01]: operation one year about to the date of
Operation Pipe Drain, it's called
[SPEAKER_01]: Operation Pipe Cleaner, where they're
doing the same sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically, they're encouraging
local law enforcement to go in and clean
[SPEAKER_01]: up their local area if they so choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So police in all sorts of different areas,
and we're getting reports from everywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the United States, places in
Texas, to Virginia, to upstate New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: to Illinois, Detroit, all different random
places, incidents of local law enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: deciding to give warnings or confiscate
pieces or raid places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like based on the local
constituents, but the federal government's
[SPEAKER_01]: giving their full blessing and encouraging
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not only the sign that happened
like in 2003, but now we're in 2004 and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're continuing the initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a huge gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all the websites that are at least
coming out of the United States that sell
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that you could be considered for
paraphernalia, no matter what,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're pretty much shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glasspipes.org is a not-profit gallery
page that some people have put together
[SPEAKER_01]: that any glass pipe artist is welcome to
start a gallery and display their work,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it's kind of open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the stuff is being channeled
through that site right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the heat is on, so to speak,
on the glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've done a fabulous job of pulling all
these folks up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The artist seems so stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful night, and they're
playing some jazz, so I think we should go
[SPEAKER_03]: catch a tune.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Aaron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna take a breath I wanna take a
breath I wanna take a breath I wanna take
a breath I wanna take
a breath I
[SPEAKER_07]: wanna take a
breath I
[SPEAKER_07]: wanna take a breath I wanna take a breath
I wanna take a breath I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanna stand up to the pros What are you
saying about those books you were looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at with pipes and art?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tribal books that have been around
They show these pieces that are hundreds
[SPEAKER_04]: of years old Sometimes thousands of years
old There's pipes there They weren't just
[SPEAKER_04]: a functional thing They had art on them
They spent time making them But you have
[SPEAKER_04]: to remember that most of them are
ceremonial pipes They're meant to be used
[SPEAKER_04]: in very specific times Like Christmas,
Easter It seems like, I wonder when did
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea of fine art come in Where people
made art that didn't function Because it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems traditionally if you look back to
like cavemen or whatever you want And also
[SPEAKER_01]: the ancient cultures come to now It seems
like traditionally the first signs of
[SPEAKER_01]: artistic expression came mostly in the
forms of functional things Like what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: read and like things that got you
intoxicated especially were made more
[SPEAKER_01]: decorative So it would be a pipe or even
just like a mace or some kind of pipe Or a
[SPEAKER_01]: vessel that would hold like intoxicating
beverage or something like that Would be
[SPEAKER_01]: more decorated and artistic, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like there wasn't a necessity
to necessarily make a hanging wall or a
[SPEAKER_01]: sculpture That just expressed how I felt
for someone to take back to their cave or
[SPEAKER_01]: their hut, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first forms of artistic expression
were gonna lie in more of a functional
[SPEAKER_01]: thing Like an everyday thing you're using
So it might start decorating a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: A spear or something they drink out of or
something they smoke out of, you know what
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how far we've come Yeah, exactly We
find when you like pull the camera out,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything changes And like I said,
some people are comfortable with cameras
[SPEAKER_01]: Check this out One's gonna like,
I wanna keep it on at all points Hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pulling my camera out You need to find
out your tally map, Sam Cause look Are you
[SPEAKER_04]: watching?
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the front of my camera Is it on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it off?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know It's on Okay, you know what
I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Well that's the thing, see I'm
showing them, like I turned the red light
[SPEAKER_04]: off So you don't know if it's on or off
How do I do this?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way, like I can just roll in and
be talking to somebody sometimes I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't, you know, it's like there's
people that I know that are like down to
[SPEAKER_04]: be interviewed and are like totally into
promoting their work I know there's like
[SPEAKER_04]: things that you just don't need to put on
I mean, unless we're all talking and like
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody seems cool with it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the idea, I just want to have it
nonchalant But I don't want to waste the
[SPEAKER_01]: battery too much That's why I didn't have
it totally like, whatever You can't just
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, oh we're having a great
conversation Now I'm pulling my camera out
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think of the glass?
[SPEAKER_01]: What piece sticks out to you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, there's so many for so many
different reasons Do you see Chris
[SPEAKER_08]: McKellar always in the service?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember his name?
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got like a little bottle They're all
like round and flat Oh, very technical,
[SPEAKER_08]: very clean technical Beautiful,
all the nice lights Yeah, beautiful stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't even make pipes He's doing good

[SPEAKER_03]: Word So we're here with Brian,
one of the first glassblowers that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: known actually And tell us, why the hell
are you a glassblower?
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd you get into this crazy knuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see, I guess probably the
first time I was exposed to glass art was
[SPEAKER_00]: up in Aspen I was hanging out and I saw a
Dale Chihuly piece And I was like wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I want to do art that looks really fun
and big and crazy and also really
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive Not that it mattered,
but I was just blown away to see a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: that had so much value in it You were
inspired?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was inspired by the colors and
stuff So that and yeah, I loved pipes too,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed that I made pipes out of
ceramics before that a little bit Yeah And
[SPEAKER_00]: then made a lot of art out of ceramics too
But snuck some pipes in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: high school style, college style Yeah It
was great Speaking of high school style,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the pieces that you have in here
are a little reflective of high school
[SPEAKER_00]: style with the Tell us about those Yeah,
the Coke can and the apple, I basically
[SPEAKER_00]: reverted to real common pipes that I think
everybody smoked out of that are not made
[SPEAKER_00]: out of glass One's a pop can and the other
one is a couple of apples But I titled the
[SPEAKER_00]: pop can one Coca-Kilia because I'm really
not that into Coca-Cola and I'm really not
[SPEAKER_03]: that into smoking out of cans Totally,
that's hilarious This is a pretty unusual
[SPEAKER_03]: event that's happening here I don't know
that there's ever been a glass show quite
[SPEAKER_03]: like this before Maybe there has,
but not in Vancouver, that's for sure Not
[SPEAKER_00]: in Vancouver, not in Canada Not in Canada
It's really a first for Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is impressive What does it mean to
you to have your stuff in this show?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud just to be with all the
different artists I see here because
[SPEAKER_00]: what's impressive is you have a really
powerful movement that came with the pipes
[SPEAKER_00]: It selected out some really good
craftspeople and artists and then those
[SPEAKER_00]: people are taking it to the next level and
they're ready to like with the way
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's building these huge pieces and
the technically and the way everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: going together, we're ready to push it way
over the limit It's amazing, it's fun to
[SPEAKER_00]: be part of or at least to be able to
witness this movement, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: so closely It's neat to have it in
Vancouver Awesome Oh yeah Thank you
