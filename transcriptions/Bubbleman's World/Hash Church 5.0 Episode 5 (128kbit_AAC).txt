[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like things went not quite how I
thought they would, but here we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome everybody to Hash Church 5.0,
episode five.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna quickly let some folks in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Quickly, quickly let some folks in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like we started in a new room,
but that's Otay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Share that down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey guys, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_09]: Otay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: David, are we gonna see you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's really what I meant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave's always, he's like me.
[SPEAKER_09]: He always has technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_09]: This morning I had a few myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: The episode didn't start where it should
have started, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are live.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got 55 people in the room checking us
out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I'm excited to hear from you
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a bunch of cool people coming in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you know Davis Allen.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's doing some research over at the
University of British Columbia with Chris
[SPEAKER_09]: Gassa, who's I guess a Harvard student
who's also over at UBC doing some work
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're coming in to talk about land
races and a bunch of other fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: So should be good to catch up,
but it's nice to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello Etienne.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Russo, thank you very much for joining
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: For 16 years ago I reached out to you
after I reached out to the University of
[SPEAKER_12]: Mississippi to get the information on how
to test cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they told me of course to,
in so many words, to get lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I contacted you and you helped me put
me in touch with Dr. Hasekamp.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want everybody to know that you were
helpful and responsible in the early days
[SPEAKER_12]: for making sure of independent testing for
cannabis back in the dark days.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to acknowledge you and
thank you for that, because of course you
[SPEAKER_12]: set us inadvertently down a path that
changed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have to thank you forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good to see everyone on this
beautiful Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got my sling off.
[SPEAKER_09]: So my arm is still completely broken,
but it feels amazing not to like be
[SPEAKER_09]: slinged up on my chest here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, good morning, Davis.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Davis Allen.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a close pal who just lives across the
way on Bowen Island actually, or is from
[SPEAKER_09]: Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if you're living there
anymore, but you are tuning in from Bowen
[SPEAKER_09]: today, correct?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm actually living on Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good to have you, dude, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking forward to some of the
conversations Davis reached out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably been a couple of weeks ago
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, Hey, you know, I'd like to
come on Hash Church, which lots of people
[SPEAKER_09]: do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was kind of like, all right,
well, Davis is a smart guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's doing some good things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked him kind of, well, what,
you know, what kind of conversations are
[SPEAKER_09]: you thinking that we might get into?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, just cause I like to have an
idea when someone new is coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: We figure out what kind of conversations
we're having.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he hits me up with, well, you know,
there's four areas I'm interested in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Land-based strains collected from isolated
regions, chemical profiles, ratios
[SPEAKER_09]: observed in specific regions and theories
behind either biodiversity or selections
[SPEAKER_09]: of traits done by local cultivars,
morphology and traits of interest,
[SPEAKER_09]: pathogen, environmental resistance
observed from various regions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then breeding development of new F1
lines from inbred land-based areas,
[SPEAKER_09]: heirlooms, true breeding hybrid lines,
selection from environmental pressure and
[SPEAKER_09]: stress tests, the pharmacology research on
major cannabinoids, potential therapeutic
[SPEAKER_09]: use other than THC, IECBD, CBG,
CBDV, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: Potential isolated compounds from cannabis
for future medical use.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then organic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not actually all Dr. Ethanry.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then he goes into organic cultivation,
no-till soil, sustainability, operating
[SPEAKER_09]: costs, cover crops, pest management via
mineral content in soil and beneficial
[SPEAKER_09]: insects and sub-irrigation benefits versus
top water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like he needs a show of his own.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_09]: He came up with some pretty good things
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in fact, his colleague, Chris is
coming into the room right now as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's a PhD researcher that he mentioned
is involved with genetics and biodiversity
[SPEAKER_09]: at UBC.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's also interested in chatting about
genetics in depth.
[SPEAKER_09]: So welcome, Chris.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good timing there, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: You came in right like at the perfect time
to give you an introduction.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to meet you and have you here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like today's conversation is going
to be a doozy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's early.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome, Dr. Mark Chaldone into the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got some heavy hitters in the room
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm all about promoting incredible
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what Hash Church has always been
about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty loose in the sense, but,
you know, we've got Dr. Ethan Russo here
[SPEAKER_09]: to begin with.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was figuring that we would start with
him and kind of let him get into some of
[SPEAKER_09]: what he wants to talk about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ethan clearly doesn't need an
introduction, but I'll give him one
[SPEAKER_09]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just an awesome, awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Has always been so humble and kind and
helpful and facilitating.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just nice to have you here,
Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, let's get right into it,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe one of the first topics you had
mentioned was CBGA, THC, and limonene for
[SPEAKER_09]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I get that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, can I have a general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it's a pleasure to be here on what
I call Hash Temple, at least during my
[SPEAKER_01]: appearances.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, you know, we've had two
publications this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one that came out was with folks
at Johns Hopkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been trying for a long time to do
what I call a deconstruction,
[SPEAKER_01]: reconstruction of cannabis components to
try and show synergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea was to follow up on
experiments that Dave Watson and I did
[SPEAKER_01]: more than 20 years ago, basically to use
different amounts of THC and limonene and
[SPEAKER_01]: show alteration of THC effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically what was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clear result of this study,
which lead author was Tori Spindle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is available free for download at
ethanrusso.org at the library tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be one of the top articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody can access it there without
going through a paywall or anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, what happened was at a
sufficient dose, people in the study had
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety induced by THC, which was
vaporized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all double blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the addition of limonene in a
sufficient dose, there was a clear
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction in the anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people can argue with the amount that
was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we addressed this possible
criticism in the article because the top
[SPEAKER_01]: dose of limonene was 15 milligrams,
which would be hard to achieve in many
[SPEAKER_01]: types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are chemovars that are
particularly rich in limonene and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: can equal or exceed the amount of THC,
particularly in type three plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did is not pure fantasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, people may realize that I've always
been a proponent of whole cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this instance, again, we had to
separate components without using herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that would just have too many
other factors that would complicate trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to interpret the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I call this deconstruction
reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other study was done with colleagues
at Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kerry Cutler is the lead author and,
again, available at ethanmousseau.org at
[SPEAKER_01]: the library tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this study, we wanted to show and
really highlight what cannabigerol,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG, can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd done a previous survey, same team,
that was published a couple of years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis and cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just a survey of people using
CBG-predominant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results were surprising because
all kinds of claims were made about
[SPEAKER_01]: medical benefits, people saying that the
CBG preparations were better than
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional medicine and very,
very significantly helped with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tested that proposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used tincture that was supposed to
be applied by Shingo Lowes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a CBG without any significant
amount of THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only turp of any concentration was
karyophylline, but really not a very high
[SPEAKER_01]: titer and unlikely to have psychoactive
effects of its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: In any event, CBG in a double blind study
that was done over Zoom on tests of
[SPEAKER_01]: induced anxiety, like counting down from
13 from a high number and restarting every
[SPEAKER_01]: time you made a mistake, showed a very
significant reduction of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is with a dose of 20 milligrams of
CBG as compared to placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprising result was there was actually
improvement in verbal memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: With CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly no evidence of impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no particular drug liking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a unique result showing an
anti-anxiety effect without any sedation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know that CBG has no drug abuse
liability.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really a spectacular agent that
deserves a lot more attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly here in the Northwest,
there are CBG only flower preparations and
[SPEAKER_01]: tinctures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But additionally, CBG in higher
concentrations with THC seems to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: really spectacular job in allaying anxiety
that's induced by THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible to still be high and have
all the benefits there from without
[SPEAKER_01]: simultaneously getting paranoid or
anything else with the right preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, that was long winded.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting that something that is a
precursor to THC could be good for anxiety
[SPEAKER_09]: when not everyone, but there certainly
could be people to speak about the
[SPEAKER_09]: potential anxiety induction that can
happen from taking in THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always kind of not so much felt it on
the wide leaf drug cultivars, but that
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenaline rich narrow leaf drug
cultivars is where I have definitely felt
[SPEAKER_09]: a little bit of that anxiety.
[SPEAKER_09]: I never felt it my whole life until I
broke my caussics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when my caussics was broken and my
whole core was just shattered and I was
[SPEAKER_09]: just having a really hard time,
I accidentally ended up taking some dabs
[SPEAKER_09]: of I think it might've been where is my
bike, which was that biker Kush crossed
[SPEAKER_09]: with amnesia haze from Karma Genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you, man, that was the first
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: First, what it did was it exasperated my
pain instead of taking it away.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then after it did that, it gave me a
full blown anxiety attack, which I had
[SPEAKER_09]: never had before, but I certainly became
cognitive and sort of empathetic to those
[SPEAKER_09]: that had told me that they had had this
happen before.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lately, since I broke my clavicle,
I've been taking quite a bit of THC
[SPEAKER_09]: gummies, just maybe like 50 to 60
milligrams a day, which is quite a bit for
[SPEAKER_09]: me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take like 10 at a time and I've had no
anxiety and it's just been the most
[SPEAKER_09]: incredible pain relief that I have ever
experienced.
[SPEAKER_09]: Clavicle is a pretty shitty bone to break.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that there's good ones, but it's a
painful one.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't realize how often you move your
shoulder and how often you feel it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's always neat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wade was speaking to this last week in
regards to how he's able to use cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: for sort of really the first time in his
life to really feel the effects of it for
[SPEAKER_09]: what he's been suffering with,
which has been a form of cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to Wade.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully he's doing okay today and we'll
see his smiley face in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to welcome Mojave into the room
and I believe it's Etienne's friend and
[SPEAKER_09]: colleague, Michael Krawitz, who's also in
the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to recognize those guys as
well as Colin Palmer snuck in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you there, homie.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, awesome guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: If anyone else has anything they want to
ask or speak to what Dr. Ethan Russo just
[SPEAKER_09]: shared, feel free to chime in.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank you very much for
your work.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has helped many people.
[SPEAKER_12]: It continues to help people, of course,
needless to say.
[SPEAKER_12]: People are tuning in because you're at the
tip of the spear usually and curious about
[SPEAKER_12]: where your spear's headed currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to do a lot more with
CBG for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kerry Cutler, my collaborator on the prior
two CBG studies, we've got two more
[SPEAKER_01]: planned.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is going to be with a higher dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd point it
[SPEAKER_01]: out and she's going to do this as an
in-lab study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be a little more aggressive in
trying to induce anxiety and they'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at things like blood pressure and
response to what's called the cold pressor
[SPEAKER_01]: test, how long it takes you to have pain
when your hand and arm are in really cold
[SPEAKER_01]: water, and how much anxiety that produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we're going to do a clinical
study of a, well, it'd be a formulation of
[SPEAKER_01]: my design.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely has CBG in it and that will
be to treat menopausal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are upcoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that, we've got a study about
educational needs in relation to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got another big review on
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we're doing a bunch of formulation
work and there's always new stuff coming
[SPEAKER_01]: along.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Johns Hopkins side, we've done
additional studies with alpha pinin at THC
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's going to be one with Mersene
in THC at UCLA with Zeva Cooper.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's looking at beta-karyophylline in THC
in relation to pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd ask this question on the webcast that
you recently gave.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a webcast maybe about a month or so
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, again, thank you for this
wonderful work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we actually responded.
[SPEAKER_07]: You responded by email and you sent me a
reference on a recent study that looked at
[SPEAKER_07]: the pharmacokinetics of CBG.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess my other question is,
what is this hitting?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this hitting 5-HT or do you know how
it's anti-anxiety mechanism?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the anti-anxiety effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have to do with serotonin
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've studied serotonin receptors for
decades and it's ceaselessly complicated
[SPEAKER_01]: because they do different things different
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can do different things at the same
receptor site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I had to explain it, I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that CBG increases GABA activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the anti-anxiety effect may well be
mediated through GABA, which is an
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibitory neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more work needed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is that this is really
an amazing anti-anxiety agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people who are aware of pharmacology,
just about every anti-anxiety drug is
[SPEAKER_01]: simultaneously sedating and or addictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not the case here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this really may be what society
currently needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's been through the wringer the
last several years, whether it's economic
[SPEAKER_01]: stress, pandemic, war, you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think personally that CBG is the
answer to a lot of what people might think
[SPEAKER_01]: of if they need a little pharmacological
help with all that stress.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you think CBGA too has its place
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you saw this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was fascinated by this and surprised
actually this study didn't get more light.
[SPEAKER_07]: But about a year and a half ago,
a group reported that CBGA shuts down
[SPEAKER_07]: store-operated calcium entry, which is
part of the inflammatory sort of cathode,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you will, and may actually be one of
the underlying mechanisms that
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids, in particular cannabinoid
acids, are anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you think CBGA, just because of that
extra acidic group, there could be some
[SPEAKER_07]: additional, and I guess where I'm going
after here, Ethan, so if you were
[SPEAKER_07]: ingesting like CBGA flour, so if you were
juicing it or somehow getting the whole
[SPEAKER_07]: flour, is there a nature to wanting to
have both the acid and the decarboxylated
[SPEAKER_07]: material?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often these combinations of the acids and
neutral cannabinoids are really helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, as compared to the other
phyto-cannabinoids, there's been extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: little work done on CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if you ask me what are the
mechanisms of action, I'd have a hard time
[SPEAKER_01]: saying very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly that would be a really great
thing for some grad student out there to
[SPEAKER_01]: do as a project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can tell you that my friend Dustin
Sulak, his Healer products, they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation that CBGA and CBG and
seemingly have a lot of good results in a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: How it compares to CBG predominant without
any CBGA, I couldn't say at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but often we do see added benefits of
combining like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You play that instrument behind you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pauline, can you sample this?
[SPEAKER_11]: I literally was just thinking the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: When people worked really hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it just happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was absolutely skunk man Sam asking
you if you played that instrument behind
[SPEAKER_09]: you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And welcome to Chimera, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since this was brought up, that's a
Turkish Oud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I play it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 11 strings and it's not in tune.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to indulge now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I picked that up at an estate
sale several months ago and been having
[SPEAKER_01]: fun with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a fellow like it down here,
but I need to replace the bridge to make
[SPEAKER_01]: it playable.
[SPEAKER_13]: How do y'all nice to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sitting here with Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good to see you came here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love you, bud.
[SPEAKER_12]: Been too long.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice to see you all.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well,
[SPEAKER_12]: that explains the feedback from Sam then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have two mics so close to one
another.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had it a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend Merlin showed up here for the
show and I was like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_09]: like I put everything in my headphones if
I don't have headphones on.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just didn't speak for the entire
show.
[SPEAKER_09]: But luckily Alec Dixon spoke for almost
the entire show that week.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Alec for coming in.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's new and different in the world of
Chimera?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're producing some pretty nice
cultivars for Kippen team there,
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they're doing, that's actually a few
years old, that stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but they're doing some grow outs and
finding some winners, which is always
[SPEAKER_13]: nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm doing some more lab work, working with
another doctor at a university here.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna be doing some interesting
stuff coming out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it'll be two years probably before
you can talk about it and we'll hear about
[SPEAKER_09]: it, but we'll be looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's a little early to give the cat
out of the bag at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's more along the lines of breeding
technologies.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was just over in Europe and my mom
passed not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I brought some of her ashes home and it
was just across the channel from David.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I figured I'd stop in and say hello.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's been kind enough to give me a bit
of respite here.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for your loss, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since you're on, I can ask you and any
of the other breeders there, is anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: selectively breeding for terpenoid
concentration?
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeding for terpenoid is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, even going back to the NAEPRO work,
we had a whole bunch of lines that were
[SPEAKER_13]: higher in terp concentration.
[SPEAKER_13]: As you know, it's really about having the
analytical method that's sensitive enough
[SPEAKER_13]: to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more selecting and breeding almost.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, like any population.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it's epigenetic and related to
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mental influences, but perhaps overall
concentration of terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of this hasn't been worked
out, but I'm just wondering if anybody out
[SPEAKER_01]: there is concentrating on this line of
research.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, like I said, even going back to the
NAEPRO days we were doing that,
[SPEAKER_13]: we had certain terpenoline lines that were
producing significantly more terpenes
[SPEAKER_13]: within a given line.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we would breed those up.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can definitely create lines that
are higher, like overall terpenoid
[SPEAKER_13]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Mark Lewis, he had one in
particular he was really interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had 2% alpha pinyin alone out of 3.9%
total terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's spectacular, considering that
most totals are about 1% on things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd sure encourage people to think
along these lines.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Ethan, I'm not a breeder,
but all the selection work that I've done
[SPEAKER_08]: and all the cultivars I've created over
all the years have been terpenoline
[SPEAKER_08]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been my game, always been a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's California.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's a big part of the world,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Terpenoline is kind of an outlier in many
ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: But interestingly enough, they are all
fairly high in CBG.
[SPEAKER_08]: So over the years, I've realized that most
of the cultivars I've selected have been
[SPEAKER_08]: 1.5% to 3% CBG and about 1% to 1.5%
terpenoline, which kind of gives it this
[SPEAKER_08]: really bellowed effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like people have always assumed that like,
wow, this is a lower THC variety.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this is the 18 to 20.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, well, actually 28%,
but it really mitigates a lot of that THC
[SPEAKER_08]: side effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: But once, Ryan, I was at the facility and
Steve Haba had showed me a variety or a
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivar that he had selected,
or I'm not sure exactly if it would maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: you bred that one, but he said it was 5%
terpenoline.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that was the one that I was talking
about previously.
[SPEAKER_13]: The highest testing plant we found
initially was 5.7%.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had a lot of faith in Matt Geese's
analytical method.
[SPEAKER_13]: He really was quite insane about correct
numbers, not just getting a reading out of
[SPEAKER_13]: a machine.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, there was a subset of the
terpenoline plants that had that really
[SPEAKER_13]: high percentage.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, like you just said, we also realized
at that point in time as well,
[SPEAKER_13]: that there was like 10 to 20% of the
terpenoline plants do overexpressed CBG.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like for whatever reason, they don't just
convert all the CBG into THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you end up with a little bit of a
buffer, or what we would call as a buffer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: He did say that was paid, that it was
unsmokable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because the high terpenoline was just
completely aggressive on your respiratory
[SPEAKER_08]: system, just in holding that in.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so funny sitting here with Sam,
but these are all lessons that he taught
[SPEAKER_13]: us so long ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even when he was growing the haze in Santa
Cruz, he had that experience where that
[SPEAKER_13]: he'd always let plants cure for a month,
or at least a month before you try to
[SPEAKER_13]: smoke them because I think that subset of
terpenoline plants that are just too much,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's too chemically.
[SPEAKER_13]: It feels too chemically.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whether that's the same thing for the use
in the extract market, I really see us
[SPEAKER_13]: going to a place where terpenes become,
and other volatiles.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's such an underappreciated,
at least from the analytical, the way the
[SPEAKER_13]: analytics are pushed in the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when you're concentrating plants into
these extracts and rosins and oils and
[SPEAKER_13]: things like that, live resins,
you don't need to be using 30% plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's a biological maxima that
the plant can have in terms of total
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoids and total terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: They share the common precursor pathway.
[SPEAKER_13]: To a degree, one comes at the opportunity
cost of the other.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that you can have plants that are
even in the 20s or 15% with a really
[SPEAKER_13]: special terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_13]: When that's extracted, that's more of a
suitable plant for the market.
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, a lot of that stuff can't
make it in a regulated system where
[SPEAKER_13]: everybody gets so focused on THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of these flavor class plants that
only produce in the 15% to 20% range get
[SPEAKER_13]: pushed to the wayside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably unsaleable most places.
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, it's the reality.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody's so driven by THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: I even see dispensaries, retail shops in
British Columbia, and you walk in and they
[SPEAKER_13]: have plants literally rated on the menu.
[SPEAKER_13]: The top is the highest percentage THC
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish it were more experiential.
[SPEAKER_01]: My son, some years ago, was runner up for
best budtender in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really tried to disabuse people of the
notion that they wanted the highest THC
[SPEAKER_01]: possible, but he didn't always gain a lot
of traction with folks buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the olden days, you didn't buy
something before you did a bioassay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That model probably worked better.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's completely connected to price.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can remember having these conversations
with you guys five to eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember Debbie Goldsberry was in the
room and she's like, guys, it's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that you are thinking these utopian
ways and you want to educate everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's like, after selling weed to
Californians for 30 plus years,
[SPEAKER_09]: all I can say is all they fucking care
about is price and THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wonder how we'll ever escape that,
and maybe we won't.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we're the fringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, people need to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have an experience, again,
as I've been mentioning, if you can be
[SPEAKER_01]: high and have the benefits without the
downside of paranoia, stress, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a totally different experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people my age really waxed prosaic
about the olden days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were very high THC chemovars
available then, but they were much less
[SPEAKER_01]: common.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the experience was different and
it wasn't all THC and all nursing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, older people miss those
kind of experiences and don't like a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of what's out there currently.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is older people and people have had the
opportunity, but in the breeder community,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a lot of people who breed and have
smoked flour that they don't sell.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of growers who have flour at
home that they grow and smoke and not what
[SPEAKER_08]: they grow at work.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really the market dynamics to me
that's really taken over cannabis where
[SPEAKER_08]: people... I remember at one point,
distribution guys in California were like,
[SPEAKER_08]: oh, people don't want that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were making big decisions for what
people want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you've got this new, really loud,
overwhelming, fruity, gassy thing that is
[SPEAKER_08]: so easy for them to sell on the nose that
it just takes over the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: In California, lemon, cherry, gelato,
and all that stuff has just so dominant in
[SPEAKER_08]: the market here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The growers themselves are like,
I hate this stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just what the kids want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what the distro guys want.
[SPEAKER_08]: I name it five different things and sell
it as five different things, but it's so
[SPEAKER_08]: easy for me to sell this.
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, that's a real market issue where
it's the ability as a brand and as a
[SPEAKER_08]: grower and as a company to say,
we believe in our product and we're going
[SPEAKER_08]: to actually put out something that we
think is special, not just following these
[SPEAKER_08]: weird market trends and dumbing down and
just making it easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That put us in this position where now
huge portions of the market are just a few
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivars that are often resold under four
or five different things, just because
[SPEAKER_08]: they're the easiest to move.
[SPEAKER_08]: People don't even necessarily like them.
[SPEAKER_08]: People who have a lot of years experience
don't necessarily like smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just know it's ... I just wanted to
say that about terpene breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid breeding is fairly strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fairly straightforward.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have the background material.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do what has to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes several years, but it's fairly
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the breeding for terpenes,
it's not so simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect there's many terpene synthases
which can express more than one kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas with cannabinoids, CBD also makes
about 20% THC, but mostly the other
[SPEAKER_03]: synthases for the different cannabinoids,
they're straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave, what you said is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the enzymes, the synthases for
the terps are promiscuous and work on
[SPEAKER_01]: different substrates and produce different
terps down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does make it really complicated,
but again, I'm hoping that somebody out
[SPEAKER_01]: there is interested enough to do the
genetic work to try and ascertain how
[SPEAKER_01]: these things are controlled.
[SPEAKER_09]: Etienne had his hand up, so I just want to
... Sorry, Colin.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure Etienne gets his
two cents in before we stray too far away
[SPEAKER_09]: from what he wanted to speak about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's also why we carried grams earlier
for people to try because I work for
[SPEAKER_12]: Berkeley Patients Group.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're turning 25 years, literally next
month.
[SPEAKER_12]: 25 years ago, that's what we were doing
because initially the consumer won in
[SPEAKER_12]: California, very educated.
[SPEAKER_12]: They knew what they were looking at or
looking for or towards, usually very
[SPEAKER_12]: terpene rich, well-grown flower was their
preference because they had seen all
[SPEAKER_12]: different types of cannabis and they
understood what worked for them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Early in our testing, when we were
starting to isolate THC and then when we
[SPEAKER_12]: found CBD, that's where we had the problem
because science wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had the problem converting what we were
missing from science from the effect
[SPEAKER_12]: because we knew that THC was not the
be-all end all.
[SPEAKER_12]: We knew it was very important.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we didn't realize the symbiotic
relationships that were there or science
[SPEAKER_12]: wasn't able to convey them at the time so
that we could get a handle on the
[SPEAKER_12]: misinformation of THC content being the
be-all end all as opposed to realizing the
[SPEAKER_12]: other cannabinoids were at play as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're still struggling with that,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope that we're able to someday get an
educational outreach to the consumer so
[SPEAKER_12]: that they can stop this because of the
alcohol causation that seems to be the
[SPEAKER_12]: predominant thinking that high THC is now
going to get me the best high.
[SPEAKER_12]: We know that therapeutically, medicinally,
that is not the case in any way.
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, we find lower THC and other
spikes in cannabinoids to be very most
[SPEAKER_12]: important.
[SPEAKER_12]: Early on, we had to go small so that
people didn't feel the financial ability
[SPEAKER_12]: to commit to the overpriced that was,
of course, cannabis, which is back then
[SPEAKER_12]: $4,000 to $6,000 a pound, which 25 years
later were thankfully is no longer the
[SPEAKER_12]: case.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry to be so long-winded there,
but I thought some perspective for the
[SPEAKER_12]: viewers might matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe medical users can drive it
because recreational units, they're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be how much THC, what's the price?
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say I was looking through
some of my COAs and some of my testing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ethan, I've always since the beginning of
being able to see what's underneath the
[SPEAKER_11]: hood in terms of what constituents are
there making up these profiles.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always tried my best to selectively
breed towards things that we're looking at
[SPEAKER_11]: the COA and saying, okay, well,
now this translate.
[SPEAKER_11]: For instance, I have lemon G13 up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always believed that it was high in
limonene.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I started working with the plant
really deeply and I realized it was just
[SPEAKER_11]: really beta-mercine that was driving it.
[SPEAKER_11]: 1.79% to 1% of limonene was really driving
the essence that I really loved of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You look at it and it's 3.2% in the COA of
beta-mercine.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really notable if you're breeding
towards flavor profiles because mercine is
[SPEAKER_11]: not something you're breeding for.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're typically trying to get away from
that, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, as we've all said, the more I
started looking towards breeding with that
[SPEAKER_11]: methodology, it dispelled whether or not
that was really the path.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think last week we really talked about
some CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think things like that are getting us
closer to understanding the ideologies
[SPEAKER_11]: that we can dispel and work through to
better understand the path.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's so much work to be done
because if you cross two offspring
[SPEAKER_11]: together, it's very highly unlikely that
they'll even resemble the mom or dad.
[SPEAKER_11]: As Sam said, selective breeding and going
towards the human aspect of things is
[SPEAKER_11]: still a big part of it today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen, you don't need to go CRISPR to do
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that people are not
doing in cannabis breeding, and I know
[SPEAKER_13]: because I've seen this and I've done it
both ways, the reason Napro and Mark Lewis
[SPEAKER_13]: are having that kind of results with the
breeding is because they take every plant
[SPEAKER_13]: and it goes to a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas the vast majority of people that
are doing this, and I would say 99.9% of
[SPEAKER_13]: the people growing cannabis, they select
the few plants that suit their goals and
[SPEAKER_13]: they send those to the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you tried to come to it from a
bioprospecting kind of thing, that's like
[SPEAKER_13]: taking a square kilometer and digging four
holes and then deciding what you know is
[SPEAKER_13]: in the entire four square kilometer space.
[SPEAKER_13]: You literally have to take every single
plant and you're looking for those things
[SPEAKER_13]: that maybe the human nose doesn't quite
detect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or really, maybe we don't detect them in
the same way.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas when you do it a chemical
analytical kind of high throughput,
[SPEAKER_13]: like brute force approach, you might see
some chemicals that are hidden in the mix
[SPEAKER_13]: that you would otherwise miss.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you can pair those plants
together or self them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that way you can actually start
driving specific terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be great to understand the
genetic mechanisms of these things so that
[SPEAKER_13]: we can develop genetic markers,
but we don't need that.
[SPEAKER_13]: The chemicals themselves are chemical
markers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was something that Mark,
as a chemist, he really hit home.
[SPEAKER_13]: The chemical, the chemosphere of the
plant, like the chemo, maybe you want to
[SPEAKER_13]: call it that, is really a reflection of
the genome, is what genes are produced.
[SPEAKER_13]: So all you have to do is look for those
outliers and one of the things that we are
[SPEAKER_13]: doing as a global community is growing a
lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of those plants find their way
kind of to the top of the cream.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like they rise to the cream and then we
get these little pictures of, oh,
[SPEAKER_13]: this is what makes this plant unique,
be it thiols or whatever chemical,
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever volatile we're looking for and
considering.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, it's an expensive thing to do to
take 100 plants or even 500 plants and
[SPEAKER_13]: send them to a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a big ol' analytical bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nobody can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I applaud Mark's approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could only do it because he had a lab
on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the way forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is a goal for other people,
it sure would be for me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Mark convinced the investor and we
had some really deep conversations with
[SPEAKER_13]: the investor and he came to understand
that that was the way it was.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the approach that was going to
win.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he handed us the keys to the car,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we got to take that toy out for a
ride.
[SPEAKER_13]: Having done it that way, you can't go back
to the other way.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you just can't make the gains that
you can with full lab support.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's kind of the way it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well said, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the one thing that I've found some of
my favorite cultivars as I get into the
[SPEAKER_11]: hood of them, they're completely
different.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what constituents that I thought were
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to your point, you can't go back.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to know now.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like it's just part of the
process and as it should be.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you realize that you're blind,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're kind of blinded if you're not doing
it that way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so once you've seen the light,
it's hard to go back into the dark.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can still screen plants for all sorts
of other things.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, even now that there's legal
systems around the world with universities
[SPEAKER_13]: that are working collaboratively with
industry, we're starting to figure some
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff out.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really the game has changed so much
in 25 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's remarkable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, speaking of that, I would love to
hear from Chris Grasaw, as well as Davis
[SPEAKER_09]: Allen.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing some work with the
University of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, if you want to maybe start,
Chris, introduce yourself and kind of give
[SPEAKER_09]: us a little lowdown on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I spent about the past five years
working on understanding really kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: the demographic history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how kind of the land races and really,
I think different species are related to
[SPEAKER_06]: each other and which kind of natural
populations the land races were
[SPEAKER_06]: domesticated from.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just recently over the past six
months or so, UBC received a permit,
[SPEAKER_06]: although no grant yet, to start some
pre-breeding to really take cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: production outdoors, breed cannabis for
outdoor cultivation in a Canadian
[SPEAKER_06]: environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, in the Pacific
Northwest, we have some link downy mildew
[SPEAKER_06]: pressures for example, we also have a
shorter growing season.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, the idea is to kind of use
this knowledge of land races and also
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe wild plants to breed some plants
that are good medicine also.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Davis has also been helping out with
that, acquiring different land race
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Davis has some quite a bit of a long
time medical patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he's able to speak on kind of the
efficacy of different varieties and some
[SPEAKER_06]: of the chemical profiles that might be
good to include in our breeding program.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'd love to hear from you as well,
Davis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: So do you want me to give my background as
well?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, give us a little cliff notes of who
you are and what you're up to.
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've actually been a medical patient
since 2011, since I was 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I got into the industry in 2013,
ultimately because I noticed that just
[SPEAKER_10]: like a lot of you guys are discussing,
like there seemed to be an emphasis just
[SPEAKER_10]: on THC and not on the full profiles of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I found really interesting is one
time I had a university lecture a few
[SPEAKER_10]: years after I received my medical card.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I noticed that there's like a
difference or an effect to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I really paid attention in class,
all these other things, because I was
[SPEAKER_10]: actually thinking about not even attending
my course because I was having some
[SPEAKER_10]: autoimmune issues.
[SPEAKER_10]: What was really interesting is we had lab
analysis done on that variety and it had a
[SPEAKER_10]: low concentration of CBG, which is really
interesting that this is being talked
[SPEAKER_10]: about in this discussion as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it really led me to look into the
chemical profiles of various varieties and
[SPEAKER_10]: have a strong interest into land races.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because what I'd noticed after years of
collecting land races is that there's
[SPEAKER_10]: distinct effects that seem to be standing
out within different varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it led me to want to collect land
races from various regions for future
[SPEAKER_10]: medical use additionally for research
purposes, which I'm fortunate enough to be
[SPEAKER_10]: sharing now with UBC.
[SPEAKER_10]: And additionally, on top of that,
I think that while I agree with you guys
[SPEAKER_10]: that like in the current market,
there's an emphasis on THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: I ultimately think over time that's going
to shift because people are recognizing
[SPEAKER_10]: more and more, at least I believe,
that having these kind of distinct
[SPEAKER_10]: profiles will allow for different type of
psychoactive profiles.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so in turn, by having this different
effect, people aren't necessarily just
[SPEAKER_10]: looking for what's the strongest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ultimately, I think the correlation is
because there's a lack of information on
[SPEAKER_10]: these other compounds within cannabis,
all people who don't really have a strong
[SPEAKER_10]: educational background can look at is the
high THC and the best price.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because ultimately, we live in an economy,
we live in a world where people have to be
[SPEAKER_10]: careful about how much they spend.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're going to be price conscious.
[SPEAKER_10]: And ultimately, when they don't have that
information, those are the two easiest
[SPEAKER_10]: things to look at.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the lowest price?
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's the highest THC?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, yeah, I truly believe that over
time that's going to change.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's interesting just a few things
that I heard from Ryan, for example,
[SPEAKER_10]: there about the, you know, profiles that
aren't necessarily, you know, 30% THC,
[SPEAKER_10]: but that in turn, if they're like at 15 to
20 have these more like unique flavor
[SPEAKER_10]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also co founded Island Genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: So like we're a health Canada licensed
cultivation company.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just recently left the company,
but still really close with everyone
[SPEAKER_10]: involved.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we noticed is that, yeah,
there's there's definitely some unique
[SPEAKER_10]: profiles that aren't necessarily the
highest THC, but they wash well.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then in turn, they have a really
interesting effect and product.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for sharing Davis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe we had Brian and pop in
snuck in behind us from best friend farms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got a got a powerhouse in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Today.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really nice to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen Ryan in so long.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was real, really nice to see him.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's always a great source of information.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what you said earlier, the chemosphere
of the plant, that might be my new
[SPEAKER_09]: favorite quote.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I was just thinking,
you know, it seems like the one thing that
[SPEAKER_08]: could save the industry right now is low
THC flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because we're in a supply and demand
issue with people overgrowing heavily
[SPEAKER_08]: saturated markets.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'd think that what the bigger
brands would want is people to smoke more
[SPEAKER_08]: flower of lower potency, you know,
make more sell five grams instead of two,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, and not that we want people
smoking all day like cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the reality is lower potency flower of
certain profiles is so much more
[SPEAKER_08]: applicable to various situations,
different consumers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just it's a much broader approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can keep your THC levels at 20 percent
and still have more terpenes than you know
[SPEAKER_03]: what to do with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't have to be extremely low.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did a study for a year and a half
with with a toxicologist and two other
[SPEAKER_11]: PhDs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I can say the name of the
company, but I'll talk about the study.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what we did was we we tested varietals
that were in the 30 percent range and then
[SPEAKER_11]: below the 20s.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we gave those patients over a year of
time those two varietals and we asked them
[SPEAKER_11]: what they thought was more potent in every
single time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe two patients out of the out of the
20 that we we did this with.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every single time they were on the on the
lower side of the TC and they thought it
[SPEAKER_11]: was it was a higher the higher one.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so I think what the learnings
that I walked away with was we need to do
[SPEAKER_11]: more of this because we need to dispel and
better understand what patients actually
[SPEAKER_11]: want and what they actually believe
through placebo into perception.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, as we're all talking about
perception of value is and we've talked
[SPEAKER_11]: about this on the other another episode
where for some reason it's like the
[SPEAKER_11]: alcohol world is seeped into into our
world and for whatever reason rhyme or
[SPEAKER_11]: reason, we haven't found a great reason to
dispel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think in that way, I think we have a
real opportunity here to to develop the
[SPEAKER_11]: path forward for that, because this is the
millionth time I've had this conversation
[SPEAKER_11]: in the past probably three months.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's a it's a constant in
terms of everyone's consciousness and what
[SPEAKER_11]: they're thinking about on a daily basis of
what they heard 30 years ago when we first
[SPEAKER_03]: tested THC levels and we found in entries
into the high times that the 25 percent
[SPEAKER_03]: ones, people didn't like them as much or
think they were strong as, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: number one, it was 17 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we knew we knew at that time that it
was the whole picture rather than just the
[SPEAKER_03]: THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it it's not easy to convince
recreational smokers, especially younger
[SPEAKER_03]: ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that last part really.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, potency, I think potency is really
important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that we can't because
cannabis is so complex, so chemically
[SPEAKER_08]: complex, we can't really put our thumb on
what potency is.
[SPEAKER_08]: But ultimately, it really is important,
I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how people navigate safety with
consumption of substances is by knowing
[SPEAKER_08]: how potent it is and how much I need to
put in my body before I feel unsafe.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis needs that to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you need to have a number on the
bottle of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to have a milligrams on the
prescription drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just it's just common sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: But cannabis is elusive in that way that
will never I don't think we'll ever really
[SPEAKER_08]: figure out potency because it's so
abstract and people are so different.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is there is a potency scale and
we can get there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just it takes a concerted effort.
[SPEAKER_08]: With scientists and industry and limiting
cultivars so people can learn like this
[SPEAKER_08]: one is this strength.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it takes it takes us back to the
conversation we had with Alec on
[SPEAKER_09]: Hashchurch 5.0 episode three, which is how
accurate are those numbers?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's a whole new warp that
you're throwing into the game.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got customers that are buying
things based on numbers on a package.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got labs that are incentivized to
give big numbers because they know they're
[SPEAKER_09]: going to get you your your business if you
do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Alec was saying there's there's a sort
of dissent to size if you are giving
[SPEAKER_09]: accurate numbers and they're not the
numbers that the companies want to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, that to me is also
playing like an enormous role.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now someone's like, oh, I only smoke
twenty fives, but they're probably,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, substantially lower than that in
the reality.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that that really throws.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many things going on in this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the labs, there's interlab.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Alec can talk about, you know,
within lab variability, but there's also
[SPEAKER_13]: interlab variability.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like people make mistakes in method
development and you misquantify or
[SPEAKER_13]: misidentify certain compounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so even when you have numbers,
the numbers are reported on a dry weight
[SPEAKER_07]: basis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The plant is 90 percent water.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So even if you have two different lab
analytics or two different studies,
[SPEAKER_13]: you can't just put those studies together
and compare the numbers as if they're the
[SPEAKER_13]: same.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were they were derived through
different analytical methods, different
[SPEAKER_13]: growers, you know, different varieties.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one thing that I have a theory and it
kind of makes sense to me, we developed we
[SPEAKER_13]: we we screened a lot of plants through the
lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: And consumed a lot of those plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: In my opinion, there's a sweet spot in
between like eight and 12 percent that
[SPEAKER_13]: people of a certain age group prefer that
type of high.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then younger kids, they never really
grew up with those things.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they don't they don't understand
the headspace that creates.
[SPEAKER_13]: They grew up in the Afghan world where
like 20 plus percent plants punch you in
[SPEAKER_13]: the face.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's how you know that you're high.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, like, I really think that like the
perception of what is high is different
[SPEAKER_13]: between people in, say, their 40s to 60s.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I was laughing when Bahavi said,
you know, the young kids, it's like,
[SPEAKER_13]: at one point in time, that was true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we're not really the young kids
anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a whole generation of kids that
grew up on pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're like 25, 30 percent mixed with THC
diamonds.
Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So like to really study this, you need a
whole bunch of uniform grown samples of
[SPEAKER_13]: different THC concentration and different
cohort groups.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, not just reference one
study and say, oh, this we figured it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there's a lot of that that goes
on the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: We take a little snapshot of something
that happens in the real world and we make
[SPEAKER_13]: this generalization of the way that it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that there's so many variables
and there's so many differences between
[SPEAKER_13]: consumers that it really is a hairball
that is quite difficult to tease apart.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even the way they... Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I was just going to say that I think
that there's plants in that 8 to 12
[SPEAKER_13]: percent THC range.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not necessarily the chemical profile
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just how loud you're listening to the
music.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it creates a certain headspace.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there really is something to be said.
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe I really do believe that like
that 8 to 12 percent on a very clear,
[SPEAKER_13]: like if you haven't used anything else
that day, that provides that clear,
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of euphoric effect that you hear a
lot of people of the 60s and 70s talking
[SPEAKER_13]: about.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's face it, like the majority of
the weed that they were smoking back then,
[SPEAKER_13]: the Thais and the Colombians and the
Highland Mexicans, that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's not 25 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of it comes in at that 8 to 12
range.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it has to do with this biphasic
effect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like with THC, you take a little bit,
you kind of get up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you take a whole bunch more,
it brings you back down.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of think it's the difference
between getting high and getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like these extracts are a rocket
ship to the moon.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first time I ever smoked Sam's dry
sift, like I had never been that high in
[SPEAKER_09]: my life off of a bungalow.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a long rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then when I started doing the hash
hits and was kind of trying to like wrap
[SPEAKER_09]: my head around, oh, I got to like get off
my high horse and produce products for
[SPEAKER_09]: people that aren't so rippling strong.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everyone wants to take a rocket ship
to the moon just because 90 percent of the
[SPEAKER_09]: people around me do.
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't really mean it's an accurate
description of what society kind of wants.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I started making these hash
hits and I hadn't really smoked in a long
[SPEAKER_09]: time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I'm going to have to smoke
these things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd go out on my electric skateboard
and I'd pull out a hash hit and have a
[SPEAKER_09]: couple of rips of, you know, like a 30
percent THC hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was super mellow for me because I
was, you know, I'd spent the last 25 years
[SPEAKER_09]: just ripping the strongest possible,
you know, 60, 70 plus percent and super
[SPEAKER_09]: concentrated five to 10 percent terpene
content.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I really found was it was just
nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just relaxing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It put me into a couple completely
different headspace.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, I appreciate I appreciate that
headspace.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, there's something that
happens, I think, with H2.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just I posted something on Twitter
earlier today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw this kid rolling up a joint where
the paper was like shatter.
[SPEAKER_13]: Essentially, it was a pliable shatter and
they just stuffed it like a cone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was not only a total waste,
you know, they weren't they were smoking
[SPEAKER_13]: it and half the more the THC was going off
in the side stream.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then into their lungs.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's like it's kind of that frat boy
mentality of like, you know, how much beer
[SPEAKER_13]: can we chug?
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just I don't think that you get the
same headspace.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's almost like headroom.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like it's it's when you listen to
music incredibly loud, it's hard to hear
[SPEAKER_13]: all the suddenly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to stay like recording music.
[SPEAKER_11]: You that's why we use compressors and
Alborg gear.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because audibly, we're looking for the
harmonics.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking to shape the frequency.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're touching on some stuff that I
think about a lot is we have harmonics are
[SPEAKER_11]: fleeting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Much like these VOCs or these volatile
compounds that we talk about.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to capture them in their perfect state
is almost like chasing this like forever.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's forever chasing your tail.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're trying to get that perfect moment
where there's an extract or it's the
[SPEAKER_11]: perfect moment when you're going to
harvest it and you're going to dry it for
[SPEAKER_11]: this set amount of time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're trying to encapsulate that
moment.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that personal what you think as
a breeder or as a or as a grower at that
[SPEAKER_11]: point in time, what you're trying to that
that moment in time that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_11]: capture.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's that's a forever moment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And bringing it back to what you're
talking about, it's the subtleties are
[SPEAKER_11]: it's almost like the music has gotten so
loud to your point where it's just blaring
[SPEAKER_11]: and I don't hear anything but just noise.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what you're talking about is getting
back to the subtleties of harmonics and
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe enough Shiner F minor or a G sustain
chord or something like that that allows
[SPEAKER_11]: you to as a user really get in touch with
why you use cannabis and the things that
[SPEAKER_11]: draw you into the plan and keep us all
here talking about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the subtleties, I think, more
importantly, are what gets us all up in
[SPEAKER_11]: the day to think about this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's it's for whatever reason,
we're not bottlenecking, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're just we're not selectively
thinking about the whole gene pool as a as
[SPEAKER_11]: a as an industry in a way we're trying to
monetize so much all the time that we're
[SPEAKER_11]: almost losing sight of what's important.
[SPEAKER_08]: So can I comment on that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Follow that a little bit is and then tied
into something that Ryan said and also
[SPEAKER_08]: something that maybe are in the lantern
race conversation that we could go down is
[SPEAKER_08]: that that the subtleties in people were
selecting plants for quite some time and a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of them were selecting individual
plants because they were smoking flour and
[SPEAKER_08]: or they were hand rubbing individual
plants, you know, and that created all
[SPEAKER_08]: these populations with all this chemistry
all around the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: These land race based populations,
let's call them, because I do believe once
[SPEAKER_08]: it leaves the land, the kind of the race
is over.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then the Afghan, Ryan mentioned
Afghan, like that Afghan population to me,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're such a big I mean, it's had such a
huge impact on modern cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was it wasn't selected for
individual plants or individual traits as
[SPEAKER_08]: much as it was selected for ability to
yield lots of resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what they did to that resin over
time and volatilizing all a lot of the
[SPEAKER_08]: aromatics and abusing it with heat and
time and they were consuming a very
[SPEAKER_08]: different product than what they were
selecting in a way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like the fact that the thing that is
the driver of modern cannabis came from a
[SPEAKER_08]: population that wasn't selecting for all
of these traits that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: individual like the nuance, the harmony,
the I mean, the the color and the
[SPEAKER_08]: resonance and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it was lost.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were selecting literally for API.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were selecting for the bulk power of
of hashish.
[SPEAKER_08]: And on top of that, they were consuming
consumers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, think about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were the heads that you're talking
about, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Afghan hash smokers, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: They smoked lots of hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like a race, you know, like,
you know, smoke, like Sam will say,
[SPEAKER_08]: like smoking the hubby bubby.
[SPEAKER_08]: Only certain people could do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like it was embedded in their culture
also to like produce this massive API
[SPEAKER_08]: resin product and consume huge doses of it
to get large amounts of THC in your system
[SPEAKER_08]: versus the guys that were handling
individual flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like so it's like what I'm getting at
is like the selective process by the
[SPEAKER_08]: people that were developing these was so
different.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe there's some kind of weird
perverse twisted, you know, prohibition
[SPEAKER_08]: story of how that made it into our modern
gene pool that we weren't actually
[SPEAKER_08]: selecting those traits.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just got there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the drives, all the drive sifters were
definitely sifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were breeding for resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they were dry sifting whole
fields, not smoking individual plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you smoke individual plants like
with ganja smokers, then it becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: possible to select the plants that you
like the best, whether it's high THC or a
[SPEAKER_03]: particular terpene taste or smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a much better way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you don't smoke the plants that
you're breeding for, individually,
[SPEAKER_03]: how the hell can you breed it for what you
want?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and they were also, you got to
remember they were also kind of only doing
[SPEAKER_13]: selections on one half of the cross,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there we are selecting the
females, but the males were all being,
[SPEAKER_13]: nobody was doing any selective males.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just getting what was around in the
population.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there was a real friction or drag in
the genetic selection, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been some pretty significant
things that have happened, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_13]: And allowing more controlled crosses and
use of clones for like back cross
[SPEAKER_13]: programs, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But moreover, like STS and breeding two
females together, that kind of thing has
[SPEAKER_13]: really changed the game.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it allows us to start making
positive genetic selection on both sides
[SPEAKER_13]: of the parents, on both sides of the
cross, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also turning males, females.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Davis had his hand up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just had a comment about that
comment earlier about Afghan populations.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the situation is that Afghan
populations and varieties from Pakistan,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're right about the selecting for resin
content over individual plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think the reality is that those
populations are very biodiverse and high
[SPEAKER_10]: in overall resin content, which is true.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's actually the Westerners selecting
just for the THC content, which has kind
[SPEAKER_10]: of like changed the, changed from like a
diverse profile into, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: chasing THC again.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the reality is like those type of
populations, like if you actually go and
[SPEAKER_10]: collect wild Afghan and Pakistan
populations, you're going to find a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: CBD, actually, like equal equal
quantities.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the reality is that because we've
artificially selected in the West for only
[SPEAKER_10]: THC, we've actually bred out a lot of the
traits that naturally exist there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not actually that it's like high
cannabinoid content, it's that we've only
[SPEAKER_10]: selected one pathway from it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a question for Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, out of all the, you know,
so-called land-raised stuff that I've
[SPEAKER_11]: collected over the years and decades,
I, you know, the stuff out of Iran,
[SPEAKER_11]: of Iran has been the most, hybrid-like
that I've ever seen, like every single
[SPEAKER_11]: thing I've gotten from that region.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think that's due to?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that that region is
selecting?
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I, first of all,
I strongly suspect that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Iranian populations that we see today are
coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan,
[SPEAKER_03]: because let me tell you, they were heavy
and hardcore on cannabis in Iran in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where did the big population
land-racers come from?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they were imported.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that makes a lot of sense because
that's exactly what I always thought.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, how is this even possible?
[SPEAKER_11]: How are these plants so good?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there hasn't really been an ability
to really grow these things the way that
[SPEAKER_11]: we envision them in the Western world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Due to their laws, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So- Mojave said something really
interesting earlier about, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: once you take the plants out of the
country, it's no longer a land race.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not even that.
[SPEAKER_13]: The definition of a land race is like a
biological type that is maintained by a
[SPEAKER_13]: culture, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: As soon as the culture's gone,
they're the people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's man and it's human and environment.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so once that human use, like,
for example, tie sticks, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like they were selected for all those
traits because that's what tied welts with
[SPEAKER_13]: a stick, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, once you take a plant population
away from its land and the culture that is
[SPEAKER_13]: responsible for ushering that breeding
system, you really are changing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's face it as well, farmers,
cannabis farmers are no different than all
[SPEAKER_13]: other farmers.
[SPEAKER_13]: They want to grow better crops every year,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So realistically, if you're thinking that
you've gone to any of these places in the
[SPEAKER_13]: last 20 years and you're collecting land
races, you're not collecting the plant
[SPEAKER_13]: that was there in the 60s and 70s,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like people have been bringing in seeds
and cannabis is a prolific out-crosser,
[SPEAKER_13]: like we all know.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I really, I'd be remarkably surprised
if these things were as they were back in
[SPEAKER_13]: time, because there's been so much money
spent all over the world in crushing these
[SPEAKER_13]: populations and crushing the cultures that
produce them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, Ryan, another thing happened is,
well, not to mention all our influence in
[SPEAKER_08]: terms of sending genetics back around the
world.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is the land race and how much of
it stayed in that land?
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you really think about,
I mean, my family history with like
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis in Mexico and South America was
like, by the 60s, Americans were going
[SPEAKER_08]: down there and they were heavily
influencing the selection process.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was no longer just the local guy in
Acapulco who's just like, this is our
[SPEAKER_08]: family thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time they came down and said,
yeah, we'll take some of this,
[SPEAKER_08]: but can you plant another field of that
over there?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be back next year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and this one was good.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about that one?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, it really became an export
product in the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of the original selection forces
had shifted towards export to a Western
[SPEAKER_08]: culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: So getting back to like, what was that
original selective force and why did that
[SPEAKER_08]: people in that culture and that geography
and that gene pool structure itself that
[SPEAKER_08]: way is really, it's such a prohibition
story about how prohibition shifted all of
[SPEAKER_08]: that and how we landed where we are today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I see like people here in
California, and I love the idea of
[SPEAKER_08]: bringing diversity back into the market,
but people using the word land race to
[SPEAKER_08]: sell cannabis and to say, this is a land
race, or I use this land race cross.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just bastardization of the word,
but it also, to me, there's a little bit
[SPEAKER_08]: of a cultural appropriation thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some protocols, some international
treaty stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you get into a really weird
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only that, but how do you maintain the
land race with less than thousands of
[SPEAKER_03]: males and thousands of females?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't, it changes every year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they were, even back then they
weren't one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's ex situ, I think is what you,
if you like land race population ex situ
[SPEAKER_08]: means like we took this population and now
we are altering it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so that's what brought this up
ultimately is like, I wanted to hear from
[SPEAKER_11]: the group because I, out of everything
I've grown, like none, it's all hybrids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I don't, I mean, let's be real.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there's nothing I've looked at was
like, oh yeah, like I haven't seen that
[SPEAKER_11]: trait before in some form of fashion or
another.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just maybe that line could be
improved, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anyone on here has seen
things they have yet to truly see,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it seems to me like there's a lot of
social appropriation.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of misinformation and a lot
of, quite frankly, hot air that's being
[SPEAKER_11]: blown around.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sure, these regions have great
respective gene pools and we should be
[SPEAKER_11]: dipping into them and working with them in
some respect, but we also have to
[SPEAKER_11]: recognize what they are and what are we
actually after here, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of Sam in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just all be honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam, Sam is conned.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, when you're around,
everybody knows that everything is half
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now Sam is conned.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is where I want to introduce a friend
of mine who I had come in, who's my
[SPEAKER_12]: mentor, who I've been working with at the
international level.
[SPEAKER_12]: His name is Michael Krowitz.
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, many of you on this panel
know him or know Ethan and Sam,
[SPEAKER_12]: et cetera, because he's an OG cannabis
collector.
[SPEAKER_12]: But one of the things that has been worked
on is this thing called the Grokht Treaty,
[SPEAKER_12]: G-R-A-K-T.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a new treaty having to deal with
land races and those land races that we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's been stolen.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to introduce Michael because
he's my mentor and also part of the
[SPEAKER_12]: Veterans Action Council, which is a
national and international organization,
[SPEAKER_12]: and have him speak on the Grokht Treaty.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I did bring him on because he's
one of those amazing collectors.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he has some amazing cannabis artifacts
that I just wanted him to show and tell
[SPEAKER_12]: and bring him on.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Michael, welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put in the chat the link to that treaty
a little while ago, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was answering Colin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the international treaties have sort of
slowly caught up to the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very, very thrilled to have a little
bit of input from our our mentor in-house
[SPEAKER_05]: here, Sam the Skunk Man, who made an
appearance in Vienna at the international
[SPEAKER_05]: meetings to speak about the need to work
on this end of, I don't know what you'd
[SPEAKER_05]: call it, sustainability, paying back,
paying forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about respect, respect for Indigenous
peoples, communities, stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also small craft farmers and their
craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're not just their genetic
resources, but most especially and
[SPEAKER_05]: importantly, the knowledge base that comes
along with the genetic resources on how to
[SPEAKER_05]: turn these genetic resources into
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would go so far as to say everything
that you've said so far has been
[SPEAKER_05]: remarkably cool, but also fits into that
category.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the traditional knowledge that
you're working on building a new craft of
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: This particular set of treaty meetings
culminated a 25 year negotiation to create
[SPEAKER_05]: a first ever international working
document that takes the Convention on
[SPEAKER_05]: Biological Diversity, the Nagoya Protocol
and other things that have been designed
[SPEAKER_05]: to create a good working relationship
between industry and stakeholders and
[SPEAKER_05]: nations and their citizens and
stakeholders and industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to take it one step further to
actually come to some sort of agreement
[SPEAKER_05]: quantifying exactly what it is that we're
talking about and coming up with some
[SPEAKER_05]: concrete ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't go so far as to come up with
sort of what we would call real
[SPEAKER_05]: enforcement mechanisms, but at least there
is now international agreements that make
[SPEAKER_05]: it possible to foreclose on those that
commit fraud at least and do some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: more egregious things that we feel like
are being done in that genetic land race
[SPEAKER_05]: community.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about the seeds that we took back
in backpacks full of weed in the 60s going
[SPEAKER_05]: all the way back to the 1860s to the
1960s.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is generational, many,
many, many generations of damage done by
[SPEAKER_05]: colonialism.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never thought as a cannabis activist
that at some point I would be sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: butting heads with colonialism and trying
to tear down some of the last
[SPEAKER_05]: infrastructure that's built out of iron
and all the rusty is not going anywhere
[SPEAKER_05]: too easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's exactly what that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael, let me interrupt for one second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know of any seed company in today's
world that is bringing land race seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: from various countries which is obeying
these treaties and kicking back to the
[SPEAKER_03]: original growth?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know of any.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And your sentiment in that regard was well
received at the United Nations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is planting new seeds of change
that hopefully will lead to those types of
[SPEAKER_05]: relationships which are healthy and
sustainable, but also give us access to
[SPEAKER_05]: these special plants that give us these
special characteristics that are our
[SPEAKER_05]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, we have access right now
because people are just liberating them
[SPEAKER_03]: for the revolution, but they don't kick
back anything of any significance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that there was one conversation I
had.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Thai Cannabis Corporation was very
concerned that the efforts to work on
[SPEAKER_05]: these treaties and negotiations might
actually stifle progress, stifle
[SPEAKER_05]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a very good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about it for quite a while,
did some research and came back with a no,
[SPEAKER_05]: it wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why is because it moves too
fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Genetics, you're only a couple of years
away from the next big discovery of
[SPEAKER_05]: something that's very specific to a
particular place, a land race that hasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: been really discovered yet and created yet
even.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's where the future is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've disconnected ourselves because of
the drug war.
[SPEAKER_05]: The drug war has very adversely affected
us as a people and made us first smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: more weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually ate more candies and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We ate more weed than we could ever eat.
So we're just sort of living in the
present.
And we're just trying to get things done.
And we're just trying to get things done.
And that's the way we're going to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be doing things before
prohibition and also growing indoors,
[SPEAKER_05]: absolute aberration, which will be
corrected.
[SPEAKER_03]: The treaty you're talking about,
in fact, they want you to share with the
[SPEAKER_03]: government and with the original growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the governments that were
suppressing the original growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a bit moody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and the other thing with any
international treaty, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: self-voluntary if you want to be part of
it, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like North America, United States and
Canada, they're not part of the Nagoya
[SPEAKER_13]: Protocol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me speak to that, because that's
a really interesting point that I also did
[SPEAKER_05]: some really intense research on not that
long ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was in communication with our U
.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: government.
[SPEAKER_05]: The United States government was,
to say, an outlier in these negotiations
[SPEAKER_05]: in Geneva would be putting it mildly.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were a thorn in everybody's side.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were a burr under the saddle of any
progress.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're not, you know, we're not
talking about old colonial damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about ongoing damage from
some of these countries first.
[SPEAKER_05]: But second, the thing is, they do apply.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why they apply,
and this is coming straight from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: government's mouth, basically,
I'm trying to quote it as best I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why we have to comply is
because the vast majority of our
[SPEAKER_05]: stakeholders in our international
community are applying these treaties.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going into commerce rules and
international trading agreements that
[SPEAKER_05]: supersede, you know, that are actually
financial based.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're based on countries that are
very willing and very.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had like 35, 40 countries that
immediately signed this treaty and put it
[SPEAKER_05]: in a force at the objection of and over
the body of the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other countries are setting these
rules up in their trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we can bolster that activity as a
cannabis, you know, industry, that would
[SPEAKER_05]: be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But even if we don't, the world will have
to conform to these trade rules,
[SPEAKER_05]: because otherwise you have no one to trade
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is the growers are not
really necessarily the breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are the trustees of the gene pool at
the present time, because the history goes
[SPEAKER_03]: back hundreds of years for many of the
Afghan and Thai and Colombian varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris, Chris had his hand up.
[SPEAKER_09]: He wanted to ask a question as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this ties into kind of what Michael and
Sam have been speaking on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just wondering kind of what what
does this benefit sharing actually look
[SPEAKER_06]: like?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Sam mentioned that the growers
are not necessarily the breeders and also
[SPEAKER_06]: that the government gets a cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it solely financial, like the
recommendation to give back?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you identify who the kind of the
beneficiary of these of these benefits
[SPEAKER_06]: actually are?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let Michael speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was actually something that
that you got me started on, Sam,
[SPEAKER_05]: thinking about this very hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we actually put a committee together
to think about this, to try to figure out
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly how.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple of things I'll say about
it just broadly.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is that our our cannabis team,
for what it's worth, agreed that this was
[SPEAKER_05]: forward looking, that this wasn't about,
you know, coming up with sanctions to
[SPEAKER_05]: correct the past, that this was,
you know, forward looking negotiations
[SPEAKER_05]: that would affect ongoing and future
agreements.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we're not talking about,
you know, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Corrective measures of the past,
you know, the monies or something like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as the government, because I
don't see the government getting money
[SPEAKER_05]: either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, let's say a big company goes down
and comes up with some seeds for a
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis product from a country near the
equator and comes back with an agreement
[SPEAKER_05]: with the actual breeder and the growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is financial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the community, the local community,
those who are in that traditional
[SPEAKER_05]: knowledge loop, I'd say at the local
level, would get financial monies and
[SPEAKER_05]: shares and, you know, ongoing support
product, you know, connection,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, with this ongoing product.
[SPEAKER_05]: The country would get things too,
though, like from, let's say, a large
[SPEAKER_05]: corporate player like that could easily
work with their national museums,
[SPEAKER_05]: their national libraries and their
national educational programs to create
[SPEAKER_05]: structured programs of learning about
these peoples and these products.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a point of national pride,
national heritage, and it's important
[SPEAKER_05]: academically, as well as the country
itself benefits from the being in the
[SPEAKER_05]: loop, so to speak, and getting the,
you know, this type of support allows them
[SPEAKER_05]: to better support their citizens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can sort of look at a corollary
with tourism, you know, the way national
[SPEAKER_05]: government brings in tourists,
but then they put them into the local
[SPEAKER_05]: community gets the funds, essentially.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to also congratulate the
reason why Michael has been working at the
[SPEAKER_12]: United Nations since 1997, and he's been
guiding me for the past four years there
[SPEAKER_12]: specifically, but yeah, he went there at
the behest of Jack Herrera and others and
[SPEAKER_12]: Dennis Perrone, and he is the reason why
medical cannabis has been legal worldwide
[SPEAKER_12]: since December 2020, him and his team.
[SPEAKER_12]: He helped change the law at the WHO and at
the United Nations level.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is the caliber that we're having
today on and speaking.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not just talking about changing the
world.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working toward it, and the group,
he's mentoring me as I work at the UN.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're trying to change the international
law by 2029, 2030 to remove cannabis from
[SPEAKER_12]: the most dangerous drug category.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it will no longer, people will no
longer be executed for cannabis around the
[SPEAKER_12]: world.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is the higher level work we're
working toward, because last year while we
[SPEAKER_12]: were at the UN, three people were executed
in Singapore just for discussing.
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't even handle the cannabis
people.
[SPEAKER_12]: So unfortunately, we're out there
countering our enemy, which is Kevin
[SPEAKER_12]: Sabet, who is the main liar who countries
like China, and Pakistan, Russia,
[SPEAKER_12]: and others are using his language to
continue to execute and kill people and
[SPEAKER_12]: imprison them all over cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to give a major thanks to
Michael Krawitz and his team for what they
[SPEAKER_12]: have done.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm humbled to just to be a part and
hope that we can achieve what we're trying
[SPEAKER_12]: for by 2030.
[SPEAKER_03]: So- At the same time, countries like
Pakistan are going to permit medical at
[SPEAKER_03]: least.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the way Morocco has changed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Morocco is allowing for medical now
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a huge change and we all owe a
grit of gratitude and thanks to Michael
[SPEAKER_12]: and others and that entire team.
[SPEAKER_03]: The battle is not done until every citizen
everywhere can grow for any reason,
[SPEAKER_03]: as long as it's safe for consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye, aye.
[SPEAKER_09]: I support that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to welcome Wade because he popped
in while we were having our chat.
[SPEAKER_09]: He got a haircut.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking slick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your microphone, maybe, or your speaker is
check your Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we doing now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decided to get my head lightened a bit and
it feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was having a rough day here,
but I really wanted to join in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a chance to hear the first hour
and change in the recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, blessed be to all of you and good
to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to have you, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're sending the best vibes that we can.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Wade is part of our Veterans Action
Council crew.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working at the national and
international level.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he is part of our advisory team.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's great to see him and Michael on
here today.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you, Marcus, for having us on to
share with the Hash Church the work that
[SPEAKER_12]: they've been doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love stacking the panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: I find the best conversations come from it
when there's just a lot of us and we can
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of just, you know, flow into these
wonderful conversations that really
[SPEAKER_09]: haven't, I haven't been hearing,
you know, like we took this big,
[SPEAKER_09]: long break with Hash Church and I thought,
oh, someone will just do it, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and there's some great podcasts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong, but they mostly do
kind of a one-on-one thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just love the idea of having a bunch
of great minds listening to one another,
[SPEAKER_09]: bouncing off one another.
[SPEAKER_09]: So appreciate all of you guys for showing
up for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Michael has a history presentation
since he's a collector like Sam and like
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob.
[SPEAKER_12]: If y'all are okay, he would like to show y
'all some cool things from cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: history.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like cool things from cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually wrote myself some notes,
which I see now we actually talk quite a
[SPEAKER_05]: bit in the chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, ATN had alluded to my sort of
prehistory back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find it endlessly fascinating that he
and I came up in the cannabis movement
[SPEAKER_05]: completely parallel to each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, at certain points, very,
very close, we were actually working with
[SPEAKER_05]: a cannabis action network and both working
with Debbie Goldsberry at the same time in
[SPEAKER_05]: the same place in Amsterdam, but just
didn't cross paths.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was probably the closest that we
came.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I came up as ATN handing out flyers at
an info table and worked our way up to the
[SPEAKER_05]: higher echelons of the thought process of
the cannabis movement, the special forces,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you will, of the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never heard about us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to say I'm that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you say the Veterans Affairs policy
on marijuana, oh, that guy or the
[SPEAKER_05]: international treaty and removing cannabis
from schedule four, yeah, that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's really my prehistory to my
activist history that comes out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that really gives me so much joy and
feels so good in my heart because I
[SPEAKER_05]: actually was a cannabis aficionado and
lover in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it weren't for just some turns of
events of the cannabis movement sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: got derailed by the cocaine experience of
the 70s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that moment, that's when I was
coming up, right at the moment where the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis movement had derailed and the
president's cannabis program and
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization had been derailed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was all this scandal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I joined the military.
[SPEAKER_05]: I joined the machine instead and tried to
get a bird's eye view, I guess you'd say,
[SPEAKER_05]: of the system from inside, which actually
worked remarkably well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to say that the work that I've
done in the Veterans Affairs and stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: like that certainly could have never been
done as a cannabis activist without me
[SPEAKER_05]: being a veteran and having that experience
as tough as it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got broken up pretty bad in Guam,
USA, have an artificial hip, no spleen,
[SPEAKER_05]: some of those things as souvenirs of my
military service.
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, no combat or anything other than
just, you know, poorly constructed
[SPEAKER_05]: roadways on my way home from dinner in
Guam.
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, but I think it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: My childhood, I grew up in the auction
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: My father was a professional auctioneer,
the president of the Auctioneer's
[SPEAKER_05]: Association, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always have looked at things from a
historical perspective and digging into
[SPEAKER_05]: the junk boxes and finding, you know,
antiques and things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that was very natural to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And coming up in the cannabis movement
just gave me the information.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is one of my favorite little
bottles, one of the first ones that I
[SPEAKER_05]: found, cannabis corn medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Raleigh's had like a truck and they'd come
around and sell you flavorings and
[SPEAKER_05]: medicines of all kinds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this had, it was cannabis for corns,
alcohol, ether and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's had cannabis, it was a pain
free corn relief.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that makes sense, you know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ether and cannabis, wow, that's gotta be a
potent mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that wasn't to be drunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was to put on your corns,
on your feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it worked, evidently.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was like maybe 50 different products
that employed that same recipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, to our
conversation, to sort of tap into the
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation that's existing here,
I think there's two things that are
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is how they employed the cannabis like
with other herbal medicines.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a cannabis in tall you and coding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are specific medicines.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a pain relief, as you can see,
a pharmacy sized jug that used a low level
[SPEAKER_05]: pain reliever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could find cannabis and every level of
pain relief and each level of pain relief
[SPEAKER_05]: would have a different herbal mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's one of the new
frontiers that we haven't reached yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a people, as a cannabis tribe,
if you will, is integrating the other
[SPEAKER_05]: herbs into our world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how does cannabis interact?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think you're having fun with
terpenes, wait until you start bringing
[SPEAKER_05]: the other herbs into the picture to get a
desired effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they had almost, you know,
I don't know if they perfected it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they certainly had a handle on it back
then with 75 different, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of gradient mixtures that they would
apply for anxiety or for pain or for
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think even more interesting in our
conversation here is how they overcame,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you'd say, the lack of knowledge
of the specific cannabinoids because they
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't even have a reading on THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun in the historical record to look
at all the efforts to try to isolate THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our university got 12 pounds of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We made extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did this test, this test, this test.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see them pulling their hair out in
the lab trying to isolate THC,
[SPEAKER_05]: which, of course, Dr. Meissner and Ms.
Shulamstein did in the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a long time coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about artifacts in the 18,
you know, 1910, 1930, 1950, 1960.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, what they did, though,
back then was they had specific source
[SPEAKER_05]: material.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is really cool because it taps
into those land races.
[SPEAKER_05]: It taps into the specific genetic
variations and specific outcomes that are
[SPEAKER_05]: geographically specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they did was they just used those
medicines from those places.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Indica was from India.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis Africanus was from Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the shit pot Cannabis Americana was up
until the 1920s when they figured out how
[SPEAKER_05]: to grow it better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty straggly looking from USA.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was actually a discussion in the
Pharmacological Association Journal as to
[SPEAKER_05]: whether they'd ever be able to grow a
medicinal quality cannabis in the United
[SPEAKER_05]: States.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Park Davis and Eli Lilly sent a team
to India and learned how to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a good documentary record of their
test cases and their efforts to create a
[SPEAKER_05]: quality cannabis Americana, which
evidently they did do in the 20s and 30s
[SPEAKER_05]: before it all got shut down by the
Marijuana Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that's how they did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Donnie Worshafter, I don't know if he's
published anything yet, but he was looking
[SPEAKER_05]: at that, you know, during an assay of the
different products, how they were
[SPEAKER_05]: employed, how these specific geographic
varieties and geographically specific
[SPEAKER_05]: products were employed in the end product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, sort of do an assessment of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think when you do, you'll see that
that's how they did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how they employed CBD predominant
or whatever, by just using the source
[SPEAKER_05]: material very carefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, I think that the museum is
particularly powerful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a couple of little sort of
exhibits for you and what it can do to
[SPEAKER_05]: show people their own history.
[SPEAKER_05]: See if I can share screen here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you got to enable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a default.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm going to show you here is I
actually as a collector and as an antique
[SPEAKER_05]: person, I came in contact with someone who
great classic story, went to a garage sale
[SPEAKER_05]: and found Lister Dewey's archive,
Lister Dewey's diary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lister Dewey was the point person for the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: Department of Agriculture from like 1890
to 1930, 1940 on hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the hemp guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wrote some of the most important
articles in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: Department of Agriculture annual reports.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some of the most important hemp
articles ever written from my perspective
[SPEAKER_05]: in the United States on hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this person found his handwritten
diary, starting in leather bound diaries
[SPEAKER_05]: written every day, you know, entries like
the Hindenbird crash today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was late for work, you know,
totally mind blowing like insight into the
[SPEAKER_05]: past, but particularly cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll show you here is being able to
show people in this case, the people of
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington, D.C., their own past and their
own collective history.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's this is an article that came out
about those diaries when we sort of made
[SPEAKER_05]: them work.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put them into action to show people
their own history and to make them real
[SPEAKER_05]: and have them do something.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an article that came out in The
Washington Post in 2010.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's got the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: once studied weed at the site of the
Pentagon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was something known to some of
our researchers like Michael Aldrich
[SPEAKER_05]: already knew this, but the people of
Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't know this and would really help
them to know this since this header
[SPEAKER_05]: disappears here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this picture that was in mixed with
the diary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is Lister Dewey on the site that
is now the Pentagon standing next to a
[SPEAKER_05]: stand of experimental U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: Department of Agriculture Hemp Plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the smile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody that's standing next to implants
has this sort of, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a very interesting sort of smile that
they have.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's one example of sort of making
this history work, showing people their
[SPEAKER_05]: own history.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to give you another.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one more recent that came about as
a result of our historical work that led
[SPEAKER_05]: to the landmark change of the World Health
Organization position on medicinal
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the International Office on
Hygiene in France.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were based in France at the time,
I think, before they moved back and forth
[SPEAKER_05]: to Geneva, the predecessor of the World
Health Organization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the picture of those guys
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this article, that's the
International Office of Public Hygiene,
[SPEAKER_05]: in this article, we talk about the actual
history of the prohibition of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: because it came to our attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is mostly work done by members of our
team that spoke French because it was in
[SPEAKER_05]: the League of Nations artifacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're all written in French.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they found what would have to be
called the true history of international
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis prohibition, which started with
patent medicines from the United States,
[SPEAKER_05]: specific ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm scrolling down to the photo here.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are from my collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are in the article, the journal
article.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll share the link.
[SPEAKER_05]: But neurologic improved.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are pain medicines from Park Davis,
made in Detroit and Kalamazoo,
[SPEAKER_05]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neurologic, and it's got high doskomus,
quinine, cannabis, but also morphine
[SPEAKER_05]: products, and other, you know,
strychnine, arsenate, aconite.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a variety of different
materials that are in these different
[SPEAKER_05]: products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, again, including things like morphine
and codeine, as I described earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is that they were outlawing
cannabis But in fact, a lot of their
[SPEAKER_05]: complaints lined up more with the mix of
some of these, you know, rather strong
[SPEAKER_05]: medicines, which my own personal theory is
they were coming off of the market in the
[SPEAKER_05]: United States sort of surplus and being
sold off on the street in Egypt and taken
[SPEAKER_05]: on the street and heavy patent medicine
with morphine and cannabis, drinking it
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, an elixir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The police in Egypt were pretty freaked
out about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Egyptian government went to the
international authorities and found a very
[SPEAKER_05]: welcome greeting from, you know,
countries like the United States with our
[SPEAKER_05]: Harry Anslinger and others that had a very
colonial view of such activity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: The article is the cannabis parlay at the
League of Nations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I encourage you to check it out if you
want.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it shows you how these artifacts can
be brought into life and put into our now
[SPEAKER_05]: and our future.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the for me, that's the most fun
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told everybody the other day,
I feel like I'm trying to put a mosaic in
[SPEAKER_05]: people's minds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I'm a mosaic artist and I've
got thousands of artifacts in my mind and
[SPEAKER_05]: they fit certain people, certain groups,
certain ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they all see what I see,
then then I'm done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then my work, my life work is done.
[SPEAKER_05]: So but anyway, that's that's the the
Cannabis Museum.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little taste of the Cannabis Museum
anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can show you this is the latest
thing I just picked up at auction.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Linden cough balsam.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this has been a pretty good cough
medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You still got the cough medicine inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see the cannabis indica product
proudly sold by a producer in the United
[SPEAKER_09]: States.
[SPEAKER_09]: So is that under point three percent and
considered hemp and that's why you can
[SPEAKER_09]: mail that shit around?
[SPEAKER_05]: The antique medicines are tricky.
[SPEAKER_05]: And eBay, for example, will pull your
items and be very mean to you if they find
[SPEAKER_05]: out that you're selling even antique
medicines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we found some more research.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the concentration of cannabis in
that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it say on the front label?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a very, you know, typical eight
percent alcohol, five grains.
[SPEAKER_05]: It means to each ounce of cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I got a very sensitive gas
chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to send me a sample of that,
I'll tell you how much is left in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be really interested.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is that so that the liquid that's in
there is the original contents that was in
[SPEAKER_07]: the bottle, you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, more than likely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's it's it's been opened,
but it doesn't look like much has been
[SPEAKER_05]: removed.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been cannabis extracts that we
found in a basement of pharmacies that
[SPEAKER_05]: were in the dark for 100 years that were
still active.
[SPEAKER_05]: You still take them today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So have you had that analyzed by a
cannabis testing lab?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything that's in my possession is
going to be processed in the archive.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the next step for the Cannabis
Museum on my end.
[SPEAKER_05]: Donnie has a museum exhibit up in Ohio
that you can actually go to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a physical exhibit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Ben Jonkers has one in Amsterdam and
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then our friend Richard has one up in
up in the hills in Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the moment, those are the displays.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as working on the artifacts in
that way, we haven't started that work
[SPEAKER_05]: yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has all been pilot work that I've
been doing forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just just a lot of medicinal bottles
of cannabis also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: David has probably the oldest artifact
that I know of a wooden cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: container, which would have been what
would you say it was from assembly 300
[SPEAKER_05]: years ago?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like fourteen fifties or fifteen
fifties, something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have older I have seeds from the
Peseric Cynthia tomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are two thousand four hundred
years old.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those those are the seeds you tossed at me
that day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, what are these?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like, oh, those are just a couple
of millennia old cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they were in the little leather
pouch found in this Sinti engraved in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Peseric tubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Sam, those are those are the Siberian
or the more Altai ancient samples.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right with the woman?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to try to know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not not from the woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: That work was done by Ethan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: With Hong and Jing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I I got seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: For helping the VAR, the Lavalov
Institute.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see St. Petersburg, who visited and they
gave me eight of the cannabis seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: the leather pouch from the archaeologists
for Cinco, who excavated the Peseric tombs
[SPEAKER_03]: about, I think, nineteen forty nine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would would you maybe be interested in
sequencing the genome of those seeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'd rather keep them.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that's insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I'll tell you, when he threw them at
me and I held them in my hand and he told
[SPEAKER_09]: me what they were, I thought, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got maybe 10 different ones that are,
you know, five hundred thousand years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are in a unique position.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twenty four hundred years old.
[SPEAKER_11]: Saying there's a chance we could pop
those, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe some of the five hundred.
[SPEAKER_11]: And with enough Bitcoin, can we get them
from you or what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I cannot be bought.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid that's the way it works.
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome to History Church, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_09]: Leave them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Leave them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Leave them in your will to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: To be explored.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, leave those to science if you if you
can there, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could those.
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's a question for the group.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could those what could we learn from
those?
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's if they were, I mean,
sure, we could map them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what Ethan found out when they
analyzed the seeds, which had been frozen,
[SPEAKER_03]: was that they were a high variety.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're not going to learn a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I might mean five,
10 or whatever percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they had more THC than then CBN or CBD
or anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were a drug variety.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were the highest THC for the lowest
dollar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Two thousand four hundred years ago that
you could get.
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been this has gone on longer than
30 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, Debbie.
[SPEAKER_12]: How many cells does it take back then to
get a seed?
[SPEAKER_05]: There was something else that the the
seeds, those seeds tell you from their
[SPEAKER_05]: placement in the tomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, in those old burial sites,
they had, you know, even their slaves and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, some of their prize people in
the tomb with them, as well as some of
[SPEAKER_05]: their prized possessions lining the walls.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then they'll have something right next
to their body, which is of extreme value
[SPEAKER_05]: to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where I understand those
cannabis seeds were found.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just reminds me of something I was
talking to these reporters years ago and I
[SPEAKER_05]: was trying to sort of, you know,
connect with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just dawned on me that and this is
going back to my cannabis movement
[SPEAKER_05]: experience and that sort of grassroots
history lesson that I learned,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a thousand pages handing out one
at a time of Jack Harris books or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, you know, that cannabis has been
involved in our lives as humans in so many
ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over such a continuous and long period of
time that by telling the story of the
[SPEAKER_05]: artifacts, you get a sort of a lens into
human history.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's more about what the plant and its
relationship with us can tell you about
[SPEAKER_05]: us, that this history tells us more than,
you know, its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's amazing that there was no
cannabis in the Americas pre-Columbus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just amazing to me,
but it's apparently true.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I thought it went all the way back
to Gondwanaland too, but there is no
[SPEAKER_12]: reference until, you know, later on
specifically.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I can't thank you guys enough
for sharing that history.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it helps us understand when I
originally came to cannabis, when I went
[SPEAKER_12]: in 89, Jack Herrera and Debbie Goldsberry
were at my university.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when Debbie handed out that piece of
fabric and I literally touched it and
[SPEAKER_12]: realized, oh, there was more to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those tangible, really holding pieces of
history have such an impact that Michael
[SPEAKER_12]: and Skunkman Sam, I mean, where are you
guys going to add this museum?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there any sort of fundraising that's
happening to make this museum a reality as
[SPEAKER_12]: opposed to all of y'all storming all of
your houses?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've given up on my idea of opening a
museum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the best cannabis museum from
both a medical and a recreational point of
[SPEAKER_03]: view is Ben Drucker's in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: That museum is pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Ben has done a fantastic job with
both the displays in Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_05]: Barcelona, really, you know, showcasing
the history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to donate a couple of museums
I talked about up in Richards,
[SPEAKER_05]: up in Sonoma, I don't know if he's
actually accepting donations, but I know
[SPEAKER_05]: Donnie is for the Cannabis Museum in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael and Michelle Aldrich and others
are working on a display in San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_05]: which hasn't really kicked off yet,
but that'll be fundraising.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm going to be fundraising
pretty soon here on the archive,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I'm going to base unless something
changes drastically right here where I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: at in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that the archive is where we'll be
really preserving the history more than
[SPEAKER_05]: anything, because a lot of the archives of
our own cannabis movement and stuff are
[SPEAKER_05]: being lost to entropy, to rain,
to water, to bad roofs, but also to like
[SPEAKER_05]: storage units and airs that don't care
about things that are throwing stuff out
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have sort of a clock that we're up
against to get this stuff into protective
[SPEAKER_05]: sleeves and photographed and up on
archive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once the archive is up and running,
you'll at least know what we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be able to go online and see what's
available.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from that, you can build any number of
displays.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, this hits really hard for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was thinking about history and how we
don't have reference points for things.
[SPEAKER_11]: And imagine if science didn't have
Macholem or something to look back on,
[SPEAKER_11]: or art didn't have Monet to look at at
perspective, or Mike Langeau's work to
[SPEAKER_11]: look at in terms of composition.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could just go on and on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could just keep talking about this.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the one thing I look at with breeding
is like, you know, Sam, you're
[SPEAKER_11]: respectfully in my world that for me,
like I look at your work, I try to study
[SPEAKER_11]: like, what did you use to make these
things?
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did you, I read a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think about a lot about that because
there's process.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's deep history that goes into what
you did and then the things that influence
[SPEAKER_11]: that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it keeps going and going and going.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we seemingly have little snapshots,
much like the, you know, I think Ryan said
[SPEAKER_11]: it well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we have little snapshots of like what
individually each individual person's
[SPEAKER_11]: taste or what they're after is
contributing to that said phenohan or
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it'd be really great to understand,
you know, where we came from, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: and what did those individuals think about
and what were those influences and why did
[SPEAKER_11]: they make those choices?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, because that's ultimately we're
arriving at a really interesting
[SPEAKER_11]: inflection point with all of this where
never before have more plants been grown
[SPEAKER_11]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all researching, racing towards
lights and different interesting concepts.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, we're forgetting,
you know, like Michael's work,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, it's very, it's actually really
important.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually so important that we
understand these reference points,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, because that's, you know,
why should you have to make the same
[SPEAKER_11]: mistake someone else already made?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, maybe that's a better way of
saying it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe there's things you can learn from it
that make your work that much better.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Mark, imagine never reading
Malcolm O'Shaughn, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, think, you know, like, where would
you be, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I think it's important that
we take this seriously and we really look
[SPEAKER_11]: at it from a real lens.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you could laugh about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could say, oh, whatever, man,
we're just crossing stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's a deeper underbelly and
undersense of real responsibility.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're all getting at here that
needs that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a really, like, amazing, you know,
amazing work, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I comment on that, Colin?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping others will join me with this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, it's important because I think
that probably the biggest selective
[SPEAKER_08]: pressure in the past for, you know,
land race populations, and I'm sure Brian
[SPEAKER_08]: and Sam could, you know, know more about
this than I do, is with climate and
[SPEAKER_08]: geography, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like the big one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, did it live or not?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did it survive here or not?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was probably a big dynamic with,
you know, cannabis Americana in the
[SPEAKER_08]: beginning as well, growing at the wrong
climate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just thought I had a comment the
other day with Kevin McKinnon had posted
[SPEAKER_08]: some stuff on LinkedIn about aspergillus
and aspergillosis and all this stuff and
[SPEAKER_08]: all this mold and total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just like, dude, it's the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, it's a real simple
selective pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, does it grow or not?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, we collectively hybridized
all these bad genes that were not meant to
[SPEAKER_08]: be grown in certain places because of
their susceptibility to mold and mildew.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just, because we were in a bubble
of pre-legalization, we fucked up the gene
[SPEAKER_08]: pool, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: We introduced a bunch of bad traits that
are really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like any farmer would say, why the hell
would you introduce the susceptibility to
[SPEAKER_08]: this thing that people all over the world
had moved away from because that's what
[SPEAKER_08]: you do.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if it lives, it survives.
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, that one thing is like how
quickly we can screw things up by not
[SPEAKER_08]: respecting history and not approaching it
like agriculture or approaching it like
[SPEAKER_08]: the people who came before us for hundreds
of years.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, don't grow moldy weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't grow weed in indoor environment and
high humidity that is not supposed to be
[SPEAKER_08]: grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of like the potato famine in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, just read the, understand the
past and like, it's just amazing how
[SPEAKER_08]: prevalent that is now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you see all these states that have
really low CFU numbers, which is also,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, an issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: 500 CFUs.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Illinois?
[SPEAKER_09]: 100.
[SPEAKER_09]: 100.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you get something to market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Davis has his hand up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he wanted to speak on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just was going to say about the like
pathogen resistance.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think ultimately what's happened is that
there's just been so many selections in a
[SPEAKER_10]: really controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're having like ridiculously low
humidities and someone's, I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: this in an condescending sense,
but like someone in their basement with
[SPEAKER_10]: like 40% or lower humidity in some cases.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then in turn, there wasn't any
biological reason generation to generation
[SPEAKER_10]: to maintain that pathogen resistance.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's happened is we're losing the
ability because we've been in such
[SPEAKER_10]: controlled environments, ultimately
because prohibition was so limiting on
[SPEAKER_10]: what it allowed people to grow and where
to grow, you know, you had to hide it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You had to make it, you know, not smell as
much as well, like all these kinds of
[SPEAKER_10]: different traits to try to hide it from,
from, you know, getting in trouble for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So essentially we've, we've lost a lot of
that genetic advantageous traits that we
[SPEAKER_10]: used to have from these various varieties
of various regions, because like you guys
[SPEAKER_10]: are saying, there was generous generations
of survival needed for these things to
[SPEAKER_10]: maintain and to propagate and to still be
around today.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, we've really been losing that
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's, it's the same thing about,
like I was saying earlier about losing
[SPEAKER_10]: diversity in terms of chemical profiles.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_10]: We, people don't have that much space.
[SPEAKER_10]: So ultimately they're going to only be
selecting for a small percentage of traits
[SPEAKER_10]: generation to generation that fits
basically what, what will fit in that
[SPEAKER_10]: space.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't really have a, you know,
15 foot tall plant, if you will,
[SPEAKER_10]: in a, in a small place in your house,
you gotta, you gotta grow that outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've selected against what could have
been advantageous traits again,
[SPEAKER_10]: in terms of yield or in terms of quality
of product or what's going to fit the
[SPEAKER_10]: environment that, you know, we've been
selecting for so long.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not even that we've left them out.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's that we haven't considered them,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can't, if you don't measure it in
science, if you don't measure it,
[SPEAKER_13]: you can't manage it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just kind of like being randomly
selected or not.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I, I kind of think of
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I try to give people the analogy of
chromosomes as like streets in a city or
[SPEAKER_13]: blocks of streets on a city.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're buying a house by the
pictures, you might pick like a really
[SPEAKER_13]: nice house, but the one next door might be
really ugly and shitty, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Run down and like, or a crack house or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's kind of what happens
genetically, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: You select for one trait heavily.
[SPEAKER_13]: Up until now, we haven't really known what
the next door traits are, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Or what other traits or bad versions of
traits are on that same city block.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, if you look at cannabis with
mildew, there's both resistance and
[SPEAKER_03]: susceptibility genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to make sure you get the right
set.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're getting to the point now though,
where we can do all these things with
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis and it really is just the will of
the breeders to invest in that kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: technology.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, I was speaking with a,
um, a profit university of the day and
[SPEAKER_13]: they've got genome sequencing down to five
bucks a sample.
[SPEAKER_13]: So at five bucks a sample, you know,
complete run, you can grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: you can grow a hundred plants and it costs
you 500 bucks to, um, to get your genomic
[SPEAKER_13]: data.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, after four weeks,
you can take that genomic data and select
[SPEAKER_13]: against 90% of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So for not that big of an investment,
we can start harvesting information about
[SPEAKER_13]: these plants kind of upstream,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Of us having to take them through the,
the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, a lot of these technologies that
haven't been available to plant breeders
[SPEAKER_13]: are now really like, we're kind of live,
like I said it the other day, we're living
[SPEAKER_13]: in the future, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: We were the, you know, it wasn't that long
ago when the first genetic markers came
[SPEAKER_13]: up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was 1995 when we had genetic markers
that would allow us to identify male
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's, it's been 30 years now and we
were way farther ahead and we have a lot
[SPEAKER_13]: more data and we have a lot more access to
these tools.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the question becomes like, you know,
like I said, with the chemical analysis
[SPEAKER_13]: and analyzing every plant, when did the
cannabis breeders, you know, the popular
[SPEAKER_13]: ones on social media, when did they start
investing in the plant?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if they don't, the future is going
to be owned by corporations that do invest
[SPEAKER_13]: in that kind of technology, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if you invest in the technology,
you'll be able to harvest the gains of
[SPEAKER_13]: those technologies.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, it's kind of, it's,
it's, I think we're coming up to kind of a
[SPEAKER_13]: make, make it a break at times.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of these people that are making a lot
of money selling seeds, they should
[SPEAKER_13]: probably start putting some of that money
back into R and D and really stepping up
[SPEAKER_13]: their game.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's really will be what allows them
to stay in the game or not, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think what you're seeing now is,
is, is actually that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've been talking to a lot of guys
that are like, man, I got tractor trailer
[SPEAKER_11]: loads of seeds that are not selling,
you know, and that's, I think that's due
[SPEAKER_11]: to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you're, you're hitting it on the
head.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, moreover, I think it's the
lack of the ability for a lot of these
[SPEAKER_11]: larger facilities.
[SPEAKER_11]: They get off cycles that are nine to 10
weeks, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're looking for clones.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're looking for trades.
So I think that's the, is the,
is the, I think the issue is that they,
you know, you know, they know that
there's, there's, there's, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: of people who are really looking at all of
these and proven things that they don't
[SPEAKER_11]: have to really invest in.
[SPEAKER_11]: But to your point, it's not really the
smartest thing to be doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and look, let's face it,
we're cannabis breeders, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like what we should be doing is breeding
the next generation and evolving the plan.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not growing fucking cookies and Chem D.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree as long as there's a lot of skunk
number one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Sam, it's already locked in there,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would say, you know, look,
Kendi, Sauer, like, we have no historical
[SPEAKER_11]: references on that as to where they came
from, truly, what makes up those profiles,
[SPEAKER_11]: how those even came to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's another aspect of, like,
the history.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that actually matters.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, we're still talking about
where the skunk and the skunk went,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, really, guys?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, this is, this is, you know,
what I think...
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say that I bred the skunk out of
skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but listen, I'm sitting here smoking
rosin with Sam as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will tell you, there are thiols all
up in this, in the stuff that we're
[SPEAKER_13]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's not the skunk.
[SPEAKER_13]: It might, that chemical might not be there
in that variety.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, like to say that these
things are gone, I think is really like
[SPEAKER_13]: people just repeating something they heard
on the internet, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, yeah, well, that's what I'm doing
right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm repeating that for a reason,
because I wanted to bring that up,
[SPEAKER_11]: because I like yourself, I agree that the
skunk still is here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think GMO is a good example of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the garlic is a good example of
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Kendi is a good example of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Chem 91 is a good example of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's... The first skunk I bred,
the first few plants, they were so loud
[SPEAKER_03]: and terpene and like a dead skunk smelling
that if you have them double ziplocked in
[SPEAKER_03]: your pocket, I mean, it struck up the
whole fucking house like a dead skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I bred away from it because I found
that the sweeter, higher one had a more
[SPEAKER_03]: ivory high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like strong, but I like ivory
strong.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've also found, look, truthfully,
those, we all know now that the thiol as
[SPEAKER_13]: well, these thiol, like whatever it is,
1, 2, 3, MBT.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of those chemicals that just a
very little bit can fill the room,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, it's kind of like going back to
that conversation with the harmonics and
[SPEAKER_13]: the outboard gear.
[SPEAKER_13]: It really is headroom, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like when you stick your bag in a,
you stick your nose in a bag of something
[SPEAKER_13]: that's heavily volatile, often you can
smell the terps, but those thiols,
[SPEAKER_13]: they kind of get lost in the mix,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can smell it much better when
somebody just brings a bag into the room
[SPEAKER_13]: and you get that little whiff of that tiny
little amount of volatile that just takes
[SPEAKER_13]: it enough to set off your receptors for
whatever reason, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just found this jar like the other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is probably like four years old.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is garlic.
[SPEAKER_11]: This stuff reeks of skunk.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's the most horrific stuff you'd
ever see.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks brown as you could ever see it,
but I'd like to get it tested to see
[SPEAKER_11]: what's in there, to be honest,
because it's some of the loudest.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I'm like, I don't even know how
this is this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not even being kept well.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just been in a jar.
[SPEAKER_09]: It reminds me of the Rene from back in the
day, which I called pot to get you busted
[SPEAKER_09]: because it was literally problematic.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got people kicked out of hotel rooms
and I'm sure that was, I mean,
[SPEAKER_09]: you could speak to it better than me,
Chimera, but I believe that there was some
[SPEAKER_09]: skunk going on in that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now listen, a bunch of people are just so
more volatile.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really, really volatile,
but they're also in there in a lot lower
[SPEAKER_07]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look at what those guys from
abstracts have published, those things are
[SPEAKER_07]: there in parts per billion, not parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you look at some of these terpenes,
they're there in single digit percentages.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's an apple and oranges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't need to be there in higher
percentages.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not necessarily their volatility.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's how powerful they are at much lower
concentration.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's both, Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we got to get Nick Ziegler on here
to speak to that because he's the one
[SPEAKER_09]: that, you know, put his multiple
analytical machines together and
[SPEAKER_09]: discovered over 1400 thiols in hops when
he was working at Yakima Chief Hopps.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a bunch of people with their hands
up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was Davis was going to go first and
then Michael had something to say and then
[SPEAKER_09]: Mojave had something to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: And once those three speak, I want to,
cause we were getting into the powdery
[SPEAKER_09]: mildews and these sort of susceptible
things, I wanted to go to Brian who wanted
[SPEAKER_09]: to talk a little bit about this fungal
blight that's wiping out gardens in the U
[SPEAKER_09]: S.
[SPEAKER_09]: So go ahead, Davis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Michael was actually before me.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was when he put his hand up,
but you did the body language and had your
[SPEAKER_09]: question before he put his hand up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So trust me, I'm perceiving all that's
going on here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to say too about when we
were talking about breeding that
[SPEAKER_10]: ultimately what I think's happened as well
is that there's like a lack of available
[SPEAKER_10]: germplasm for a lot of these seed
developers or breeders.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the thing is too, is that
without sounding insulting here,
[SPEAKER_10]: like there are breeders within the space
that just want to use other people's work.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, how many companies have just been,
you know, developed essentially by taking
[SPEAKER_10]: skunk number one and crossing with
something rather than just trying to make
[SPEAKER_10]: it something new.
[SPEAKER_10]: And on one hand, like, I think skunk is
one of the best strains in the entire
[SPEAKER_10]: world.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I have nothing but positive things to
say, but that doesn't change the fact
[SPEAKER_10]: that, you know, there's a lot of companies
just profiting off of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many companies just have, you know,
cookies crosses that ultimately they're
[SPEAKER_10]: using.
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that lack of germplasm being
available, it's, it's all also what's
[SPEAKER_10]: limited a lot of these people from
producing new varieties or producing new
[SPEAKER_10]: things.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I completely agree with you,
Ryan, that nowadays I think the future
[SPEAKER_10]: only is going to be, and I really see like
a Renaissance within the breeding sector
[SPEAKER_10]: that we're going to see more genotyping.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to see more advancement in
terms of like identifying all the markers
[SPEAKER_10]: rather than just, you know, crossing what
you think is going to sell.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other thing I wanted to state with
that as well is that I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: with, again, without sounding insulting,
like some of the seed producers out there,
[SPEAKER_10]: they're not truly developing new lines.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just crossing together varieties
that are popular rather than trying to
[SPEAKER_10]: develop something new or trying to develop
and improve in some way.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's, it's more about the
marketability of having a name rather than
[SPEAKER_10]: actually have a product that's
differentiated as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Michael.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so this sort of interjecting from
the totally confusing things, but there
[SPEAKER_05]: was one other thing that came to mind that
I wanted to share with y'all.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a 16 page brochure that part of
Davis created.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, when I located this,
I was very excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought the attention of Dr. Micaria.
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who don't know who Dr. Todd
Micaria was, he was probably one of our
[SPEAKER_05]: frontline experts on medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall in the medicinal cannabis
movement, he was the point person for the
[SPEAKER_05]: National Institutes of Mental Health
cannabis team back in the sixties when
[SPEAKER_05]: they were looking, you know, just
beginning to look into cannabis issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, this was a color, this is
black and white for our journal article,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's a color brochure and 16 pages
talking about their cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's their lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be, that's a nice lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cool if we had a lab like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I just wanted to share that with
Dr. Todd.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did this article, The Marketing of
Cannabis Americana.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about, basically republished the
brochure in its entirety.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he and I talked about it, but it was a
lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mojave.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to point something out
because you guys were talking about aroma
[SPEAKER_08]: and like a friend of mine just told me a
while ago, it's like, are you on a war
[SPEAKER_08]: against aroma?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's a topic that I think we kind
of gloss over a little bit too quickly
[SPEAKER_08]: because cannabis to me is a drug and it's
a medicinal plant and it has a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: value.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we talk about, when we put things
in the scope of aroma, the way things
[SPEAKER_08]: smell, loud cannabis, that word came up,
it's such a marketable, easy to market
[SPEAKER_08]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we really don't know what parts are
good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ethan is known for his work with David on
the entourage effect, but we still don't
[SPEAKER_08]: know really what is that, what
contributes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ethan did some work with a particular
paper called The Know's Nose.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's about how we use our nose to
drive our selective process and that we
[SPEAKER_08]: know what we like.
[SPEAKER_08]: But David mentioned something or Sam,
you mentioned something really good last
[SPEAKER_08]: week.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was last week when you talked
about your cross with haze and hemp and
[SPEAKER_08]: you made a hemp variety that smelled like
haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what do we want from it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want just aromas?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the aroma the driving force?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because every breeder I talked to just
talks about aroma.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that haze smelling hemp, man,
that did not get you high, but it smelled
[SPEAKER_08]: like it did.
[SPEAKER_08]: It had all the right aroma.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the way we're looking at like breeding
and selection and marketing and the
[SPEAKER_08]: consumer, I kind of feel like it's a
little bit dangerous and maybe even a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit reckless to put this big
conversation that's cannabis chemistry
[SPEAKER_08]: solely into the aroma class, because that,
it triggers a different part of your brain
[SPEAKER_08]: and the consumer, a relationship with it
is so different than the medicinal drug
[SPEAKER_08]: effect side.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's really important because I see
people choosing selecting aroma and
[SPEAKER_08]: skipping over the effect and losing
customers, losing consumers, losing
[SPEAKER_08]: patients because they're not delivering,
they're not even seeking what we really
[SPEAKER_08]: thought, what we sought out from cannabis,
which was a drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just Jolly Ranchers and flowers
and soda pop.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the drug behind those aromas and how
we connect those two, which is still like
[SPEAKER_08]: this big science styles.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the indoor discussion that
abstracts brought up to me is the most
[SPEAKER_08]: compelling thing I've heard in years in
terms of entourage effect is that there's
[SPEAKER_08]: a neurotransmitter precursors that are
ubiquitous in all of cannabis that also
[SPEAKER_08]: have a really interesting baseline aroma.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, I mean, it's like, whoa,
you know, but it's not a pleasant aroma or
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not the one that is the market lemon
cherry gelato aroma.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's from a lack of information
being accessible again, because ultimately
[SPEAKER_10]: there's, what I've heard from friends of
mine that own dispensaries and a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: friends of mine who are less familiar with
the industry is they'll say how someone
[SPEAKER_10]: mentioned to them, Oh, well, you know,
this smells this way.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going to have that kind of effect
rather than having more of like an
[SPEAKER_10]: objective conversation about the complexes
of all the compounds in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it's like, it's easier to have
that be as part of an explanation than to
[SPEAKER_10]: say about the chemical diversity and all
the different compounds that are in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just more simplistic.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, there's truth to the idea that
different terpenes will in turn,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, modulate the profile and effect
to some extent.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think what's happened is that that's
become the dominant conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's easier for people who don't
necessarily understand the chemistry of
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis to use that as their like driving
conversation or their marketing tool.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's ultimately too, I think it's
especially like we were talking about with
[SPEAKER_10]: younger people.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're less aware of like, you know,
diversity of effects, because again,
[SPEAKER_10]: they've just been led to this idea,
Oh, it smells this way.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to have a different effect
rather than the idea of the full diversity
[SPEAKER_10]: of the profile.
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the same time, I'm not trying to
dismiss like terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just trying to say that I think it's
just easier to communicate that to people.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's easier to have that type of
understanding rather than to have the idea
[SPEAKER_10]: that it's a very complex plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's crazy and a little bit dangerous
is my point is that if we market,
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like, and this is a joke,
and I've said it before, and it's just a,
[SPEAKER_08]: but if we marketed like opioids that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey dude, these Vicodins are strawberry
flavored Vicodins and these are the right
[SPEAKER_08]: one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's going to choose the strawberry
ones, but that's really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it takes everyone on a different path.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it takes our brains and our
relationships with products because flavor
[SPEAKER_08]: and aroma are so primal and they're about
safety.
[SPEAKER_08]: And about security where a drug thing is
very esoteric and requires a deeper.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to me, it's not the consumer or the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of the breeders and the big
brands that have to kind of get
[SPEAKER_08]: responsible and like, not just,
not just, not just about, it's an
[SPEAKER_08]: opportunity to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a drugs are, you know,
selling drugs is the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was like, there's an opportunity
with aligning with that type of strategy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just harder.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very much deeper than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially with cannabis, because it's
been shown again, beta cariophylline,
[SPEAKER_07]: for example, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, uh, acts on CB2, but I think,
I think what happens in general with,
[SPEAKER_07]: with terpenes is that they increase the
fluidity at the lipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's likely, and again,
I think this is just the hypothetical,
[SPEAKER_07]: although there's a couple, couple articles
that have shown this is that, is that
[SPEAKER_07]: there's an outside in signal that up
regulates receptor expression at the cell
[SPEAKER_07]: surface.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a, it's a very complicated
mechanism because what's happening is
[SPEAKER_07]: again, terpenes kind of intercalate into
the lipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've likened it to just opening up the
windows at your house, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to start exchanging the air
between the outside of your house and the
[SPEAKER_07]: inside of your house.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when, when that happens, again,
there's a lot of compounds that are
[SPEAKER_07]: secondary messengers that are coming in
that could potentially up regulate
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid expression.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's too bad Dr. Russo had to duck out
because I think this is the molecular
[SPEAKER_07]: basis that could explain the entourage or
the ensemble effect, which is that how do
[SPEAKER_07]: you have, like Stam has said for years
here at Hashchurch that terpenes can
[SPEAKER_07]: modulate the action.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Davis, you, you had just said
this too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terpenes can modulate the action of THC at
CB1.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how does that happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I also, I also say that a few of
them can potentiate the effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Potentially as opposed to modulate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so what kind of mechanisms just think
simplistically, how can that potentially
[SPEAKER_07]: happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: So since there could be a conformational
change in the receptor active site that
[SPEAKER_07]: makes those THC molecules work better.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think what could certainly be at
play here is again, a signal that we don't
[SPEAKER_07]: quite understand, but there's something
coming into the cell that's basically
[SPEAKER_07]: causing an up regulation of receptors.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now there's more CB1 receptors with
more CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The, the effect can be more, more
pronounced and why a full spectrum,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, medication with full terpene
entourage all the thiols, aldehydes,
[SPEAKER_07]: esters, everything else that we know,
you know, we were kind of saying this on
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashchurch a week or so ago that we can do
a live resident analysis now and between
[SPEAKER_07]: the terpenes and between the cannabinoids,
we're accounting for 99.9% of the material
[SPEAKER_07]: that's in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's yeah, thiols in there at very,
very low concentration, but essentially
[SPEAKER_07]: we've, we've identified everything that's
coming out of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just even like a handful of
years ago on Hashchurch, we were talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about this and we were still kind of like
in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you think about like what those guys
at abstracts have done, which is they've
[SPEAKER_07]: identified that very minor component
that's there in an order of magnitude less
[SPEAKER_07]: than the terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Terpenes are there in single percentages.
[SPEAKER_07]: These things don't have to be in there in
a whole lot to add a whole lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so cool because like,
I think the thing when Ian talks about
[SPEAKER_07]: this, you know, they'll, they'll go after
things like limonene dominance in like a
[SPEAKER_07]: fruity or lemony kind of strain and not
find limonene in there at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, man, there's something else
that's creating a citrus kind of,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, lemon type fragrance that has
nothing to do with limonene.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you were just focusing just on
limonene itself, you'd kind of miss the
[SPEAKER_07]: forest through the trees.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the one thing I was thinking
about the, what you're saying,
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark, and it's almost like the ozone layer
getting blown up for a second and then
[SPEAKER_11]: slowly repairing itself and the blood
brain barrier and those constituents going
[SPEAKER_11]: through.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when, when, you know, a lot of the
things that I was doing in the last two
[SPEAKER_11]: years, when we were looking at a sleep
formulation, we started really spend a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: of time on cannabinoids and then I shifted
and started spending a lot of time on
[SPEAKER_11]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was a very clear reason why is
because it was very clear that the
[SPEAKER_11]: modulating aspects of those formulations
were actually more important for sleep
[SPEAKER_11]: than the actual cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: The constituent of it was important to get
there, but it wasn't CBN that got you
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like, yeah, you get to sleep with
CBN, but it actually was like more of an
[SPEAKER_11]: antagonist for your sleeping to wake you
up in the middle of the night than it was
[SPEAKER_11]: to keep you asleep the whole time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the modulating, what I learned
was there's just a whole lot to learn in
[SPEAKER_11]: terms of the modulation aspect.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it truly keeps you on your toes,
but we have a real problem with our
[SPEAKER_11]: industry is like making these
formulations.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a real line in the sand of like,
you have the plant on the right,
[SPEAKER_11]: and then you have pheromones and all this
other flavorants, if you will,
[SPEAKER_11]: we'll just call them that, that are not
from the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sure, you can get these profiles to
mimic in some respect, but to your point
[SPEAKER_11]: of actually the modulation and getting
through the brain barrier and actually
[SPEAKER_11]: doing what it's supposed to do,
creating those formulations in the lab,
[SPEAKER_11]: I think are far more difficult than anyone
in the wildest dreams understands.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, you know, and there's also
toxicology problems with that major,
[SPEAKER_11]: major talks problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I'd love to, you know,
again, I don't, we don't want to throw
[SPEAKER_07]: Ethan under the bus, but I think is,
doesn't he work or advise?
[SPEAKER_07]: He does.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he does.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's this huge business around,
you know, cannabis, terpenes, or are they
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis derived?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they not cannabis derived?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's, there's this pump,
there's this farm, Colin, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_07]: you know them up in Oregon called terpene
belt farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think their business model is,
yeah, just to harvest, steam distill the
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes and then plow the cannabis back
into the fields.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're not even going after,
they're not even going after cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, you know, again, kind of like
what Davis was saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think what we've all been saying,
which is that, and I think Mojave
[SPEAKER_07]: mentioned the nose paper and the nose
paper again, I think was like one of those
[SPEAKER_07]: is interesting how those papers kind of
came out because the nose paper came out
[SPEAKER_07]: while abstracts was doing their work
around thiols and the nose paper kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: like, if you think about it, what they're
saying is that there's something more than
[SPEAKER_07]: just terpene profile, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't just look at, oh,
to penile dominant strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about the California
terpene dominance and, and, and what,
[SPEAKER_07]: what that means to people and,
and the people who like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: gassy kind of like chem and sour D.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a certain kind of flavor
aroma in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really not citrusy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more gassy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more like tastes like a solid kind of
like what, what that does to efficacy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think when you experience like you're
pulling a dab or you're pulling a vape pen
[SPEAKER_07]: and you want that vape pen just to taste
like the cannabis from which it's derived.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, interesting to go back to Ryan's
earlier discussion.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when you look at these fresh
frozen profiles and compare it to
[SPEAKER_07]: something that's been dried and then cured
for several months, not only is the
[SPEAKER_07]: terpene content completely different,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you're losing a lot of those
terpenes and drying and curing,
[SPEAKER_07]: but now the whole profile has changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think like all that mercy dominance
that you see in live resident,
[SPEAKER_07]: everything I think what happens is not
only does the mercy volatilize on drying,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I think it probably does maybe
chemistry and turns into other terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could they be oxidizing the terpenoids?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like the huge, uh, like in fact that
hash, you need hash, you need hash
[SPEAKER_07]: machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I not saying the molecule, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's an oxidative degradated
product of mercy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's found that it only happened in
the, the, the outside skin of the hash
[SPEAKER_07]: that was exposed to light.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's probably a fair amount of
chemistry happening in the cure that
[SPEAKER_07]: you're not getting in fresh frozen or live
resident.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, I love it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's great that you can do kind of
like a live resident profile that captures
[SPEAKER_07]: exactly the terpene profiles in the
plants, but also do what Sam had done for
[SPEAKER_07]: years, which is like, you can't smoke that
stuff until six months from now,
[SPEAKER_07]: after you've had a wholesale dry and then
a cure for at least, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_07]: four or five months, then you could smoke
it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you look at steam distilled
turps, like the one thing I've learned
[SPEAKER_11]: from working with people like TBF and
others and at scale is like getting those
[SPEAKER_11]: really sulfur, that's real sulfur
compounds is nearly impossible because
[SPEAKER_11]: you're burning them off during that
process.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and that's what those compounds are
essentially, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or those profiles that have amount to,
um, maybe a little bit is volatilizing,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you taste good Chem D or when you
taste sour diesel, you're probably getting
[SPEAKER_07]: a few PPB of the sulfur compounds that you
think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's, I guess what I'm getting is it's
very difficult.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but there's also a dichotomy here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like someone goes into a store and someone
said it, like maybe Mark, he said it,
[SPEAKER_11]: we have a problem with marketing.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are marketing these profiles as
such.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and I'm discerning consumer goes in
for sour diesel and it's some lab
[SPEAKER_11]: concoction of resemblance of it,
you know, that says sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's not, nothing came from the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: So therefore it doesn't even resemble the
profile, but they walk away saying,
[SPEAKER_11]: like telling their friends, this is sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and themselves, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's also a problem,
um, within the actual, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: retail side of it, the industry and
marketing aspect.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, it's just store bought turps
that taste any good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've only made them right from fresh
plants that we've grown and meticulous.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've never bought from a terpene vendor.
[SPEAKER_12]: No one has been able to produce anything
close to the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing because like all those
flavorants are being used in vape pens
[SPEAKER_07]: today because, you know, you know,
those are food grade, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's what you're talking as opposed to
properly extracted turps.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Colin is talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, I can tell you, like I've audited
all these guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked at all their SDS.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a really great team around me of,
of great, brilliant toxicologists.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what we found is that almost every
single formulation has ridiculous amounts
[SPEAKER_11]: of things that from a tox perspective just
shouldn't even be in there at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, it's really concerning.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's really something,
you know, these, you know, people go in
[SPEAKER_11]: for wellness and they come out with other
things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's the other dichotomy
we're in that I think about.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's our job.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's literally our job to make great
products, to serve those patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, because we are patients as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need the right medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know if you saw that the
couple very interesting pieces of
[SPEAKER_07]: legislation this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yesterday, Gavin Newsom kind of threw down
the gauntlet in California outlawing all
[SPEAKER_07]: synthetic intoxicating cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so a few months ago, there was a
ruling that Rod Kite had kind of poked the
[SPEAKER_07]: DEA bear and got the DEA to basically say
that THCO is schedule one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also the THC, the Delta 8 and Delta 9
from which it's derived is also schedule
[SPEAKER_07]: one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then yesterday or I think the day
before the Fourth Circuit court just
[SPEAKER_07]: turned that over and they basically said
that THCO, which is the acetate of THCA
[SPEAKER_07]: qualifies as hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is kind of like a step in the
wrong direction because man, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: like it's basically given these hemp folks
now a leg up saying that there's court
[SPEAKER_07]: precedent now that this is now hemp and
it's all synthetic.
[SPEAKER_07]: The plant doesn't make this stuff at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this feeds that whole beast of,
you know, why is someone going to go to
[SPEAKER_07]: ATN shop and buy a $40 vape pen?
[SPEAKER_13]: That hemp industry is making big money off
of those little loopholes and don't think
[SPEAKER_13]: that they're not spending some of that
money in Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ryan, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Colorado task force that was
looking into this and there's lawsuits
[SPEAKER_07]: estimates that market just south of $60
billion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So greater than 50 billion, the combined
cannabis market in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: combined they think is only about 29
million.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is like 2X greater than the
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a much larger addressable market.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have no regulations and they can sell
on the internet over state lines two
[SPEAKER_07]: clicks after saying that you're 21 years
old, they're asking you for your credit
[SPEAKER_07]: card information.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis industry is going to compete.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they're spending like I know that
they're spending big money with certain
[SPEAKER_13]: candidates, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, it's obviously you don't
want to hear it that you think that that
[SPEAKER_13]: money is influencing judicial systems,
but it's certainly influencing political
[SPEAKER_13]: systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're absolutely right,
because most big multi-state operators,
[SPEAKER_07]: including WANA, including a lot of other
ones are now making plays into this hemp
[SPEAKER_07]: space.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like you can't beat them
while we're going to join them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, try to take some of that market
share away.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a it is really a shit show down
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know how the regulated
market is going to survive this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Davis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's incredibly hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sam was just saying that the best way to
fight it is to allow home growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can't say I disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, a lot of these things happen
because you've got one set of law for the
[SPEAKER_13]: federal regulations on hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you have a bunch of different
island regulations that apply to the
[SPEAKER_13]: different states.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, man, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's going to change things for sure
when the federal federal federal
[SPEAKER_13]: legalization happens.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I also just want to say as
a Canadian and having done that,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, regulating cannabis or
legalizing cannabis effectively destroyed
[SPEAKER_13]: the seed market in Canada, Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how did what do you what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: For for the M mostly for export,
like, you know, at the same time,
[SPEAKER_13]: the states has lightened up and considered
cannabis seed as hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: We we now have like a high excise tax and
you actually have to get federal export
[SPEAKER_13]: license and import licenses.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really made created a legal
situation where we can't operate,
[SPEAKER_13]: whereas the opposite has happened in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, well, that's going to change here in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's actually going to be a hemp bill.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've talked to people behind the scenes
that's coming down the pike in October.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is going to close the loopholes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, of course, what Dr. Scaldone was
talking about, which is that court setting
[SPEAKER_12]: around THCO just kind of put a little
thorn in that side because of that legal
[SPEAKER_12]: precedence there is kind of upset the cart
because a bunch pardon my language,
[SPEAKER_12]: the DA has got a hard on waiting for this
to be changed so that they can come bash
[SPEAKER_12]: in skulls.
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been waiting for so long to come
in and to get with people that that
[SPEAKER_12]: loophole is going to close.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it will be bipartisan and it's coming.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we can act surprised.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know people who have ramped up who
are just getting rid of their stock now
[SPEAKER_12]: because the writing is on the wall.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when right after that comes,
then comes the hammer and it's going to
[SPEAKER_12]: come down hard and heavy and it's going to
be ugly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: is in a real renaissance right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of drug use going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you really I mean, and the farm
bill hemp is a perfect example of that,
[SPEAKER_08]: how it's being pushed through so
aggressively and with little with little
[SPEAKER_08]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_08]: But go to your local head shops and see
what's on the shelf now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I ran head shops in L.A.
[SPEAKER_08]: 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: I managed a couple of head shops and there
was things on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, head shops are a drugstore.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: Neurotropic is a new thing in head shops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nootropic.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a new way of selling psychedelics
somewhat legally.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a bunch of stimulants that they're
selling.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of kava.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of kratom.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of, you know, there's it's
about walls of it and the walls of weed to
[SPEAKER_08]: THCA flour and all every different vape
and every different, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is all on the shelf at your
local corner store.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of it is a little bit fuzzy in terms
of gray area.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of it's fully legal because it's been
tested in courts.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the but the far out part is it is on
Main Street.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I when I ran head shops in the in
the late 90s, we couldn't even call it a
[SPEAKER_08]: bong because it was a tobacco store.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was it was prohibition days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now those head shops, which are everywhere
now, there's way more head shops than
[SPEAKER_08]: ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they sell walls and walls of drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not against that at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think drugs are part of, you know,
human evolution.
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to feel different, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it does require regulation and it does
require some public safety mechanisms to
[SPEAKER_08]: make sure that it's done right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I talk to the guys at the head
shop, because one of those right next to
[SPEAKER_08]: my local pizza place and I go in there and
just rap with the guy and he tells me
[SPEAKER_08]: about all the drugs he's selling all day
long.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's like you can call it whatever
you want, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's drugs and they're not people
aren't coming in for rolling papers and
[SPEAKER_08]: vapes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're coming in for these weird
different combo drugs, Michael,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is far out because it's like these
compounded, you know, things where it's
[SPEAKER_08]: kratom and some kind of other stimulant
and some kind of other weird thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's and they're selling it like
hotcakes all day long.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's in these are and this is and
this is in L.A.
[SPEAKER_08]: when you still dispensary, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can get the legal weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get the trapper weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get the head shop weed and you can
get mushrooms at the church up in Oakland
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can get DMT at the other place in
Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then every thousands and thousands of
head shops all over the state,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can buy all these other substances.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, something's going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that like places like
Minnesota sell THC beverages and THC vapes
[SPEAKER_08]: at almost every gas station now,
it's not going back.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I say.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just we're not going back.
[SPEAKER_08]: And whether it's a farm bill path or
whatever or whatever loophole or whatever,
[SPEAKER_08]: something's going on.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just speaking of that,
actually, Michael Krowitz is actually
[SPEAKER_12]: going to be testifying specifically on
kratom.
[SPEAKER_12]: Part of our international group helped
keep kratom legal a few years ago when
[SPEAKER_12]: other countries wanted to make it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Michael Krowitz, you want to speak on
that?
[SPEAKER_12]: What you'll be speaking for.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's the 20th in D.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I guess just the basics of
this hearing, there's going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: considerable amount of scientific support,
some very top, sub-top medical experts,
[SPEAKER_05]: including the head of NIDA, National
Institutes of Drug Abuse, which is
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my aspect of it is just to talk about
veterans issues, the difficulty of dealing
[SPEAKER_05]: with plant material in, you know,
Veterans Affairs hospitals are kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like prisons in the regard that they
really work on label mostly.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't really work even off label,
let alone anything outside the box.
[SPEAKER_05]: So getting like plant material inside the
VA pharmacy short of an FDA approved
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine is really it's our challenge at
our Veterans Action Council.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it's one of our key challenges.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's that's what we're trying to do
in the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And kratom, like cannabis, is helping a
lot of veterans and other people not hit
[SPEAKER_05]: rock bottom with opiates.
[SPEAKER_05]: And being one of the statisticians with
opiate death or suicide death as well for
[SPEAKER_05]: some of our groups like like veterans,
you know, police, first responders,
[SPEAKER_05]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: So having cannabis and kratom sort of
pushed out of the system by drug testing
[SPEAKER_05]: is not that doesn't lead you to the end
you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's basically what I'm going
to be telling these guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to comment on talking
about, like, you know, the synthetic
[SPEAKER_10]: products and the other things getting
around.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think part of that is because there's
still legislation against cannabis in so
[SPEAKER_10]: many states, of course, people are going
to try to find every single way to get
[SPEAKER_10]: around the laws and regulations to get it
through.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so ultimately, what I do think is
going to be a shift is that once there's
[SPEAKER_10]: more federal recognition of it,
once at very least that we have medical
[SPEAKER_10]: marijuana at a federal level of the United
States, we will start to see a shift,
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe, in terms of all these loopholes
being closed.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's part of the problem is every time
we try to, you know, try to avoid the
[SPEAKER_10]: issue, we're essentially making it worse
because we're getting all these synthetic
[SPEAKER_10]: compounds rather than, you know,
natural cannabis derivatives into the
[SPEAKER_10]: market.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's leading again to more
misinformation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's a naturally derived product or
something like that rather than actually
[SPEAKER_10]: being from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted to comment on one thing
that was mentioned earlier when we were
[SPEAKER_10]: talking about strain profiles and the
synthetic synthetic ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I think there's even more than
just that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, when we were talking about sour
diesel, there's people that I know that
[SPEAKER_10]: will tell me that they have sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I smell like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is definitely not sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's not even really a regulation,
if you will, in the legal Canadian market
[SPEAKER_10]: here that recognizes specific varieties
and specific profiles.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's part of, again, the problem
with all the misinformation within the
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis space is there's users who don't
necessarily know what's what.
[SPEAKER_10]: I usually give this as an example of,
let's say, Pink Kush was selling really
[SPEAKER_10]: well.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a specific smell to it,
has a specific effect, has a specific
[SPEAKER_10]: look.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if one company is having success
with that, ultimately, a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_10]: companies, there's nothing stopping them
from saying, oh, yeah, we have Pink Kush
[SPEAKER_10]: and just renaming a variety that they have
that name.
[SPEAKER_10]: And ultimately, it leads to more
misinformation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then additionally, as well,
there, you know, let's say someone sees
[SPEAKER_10]: that there's this Pink Kush now at a more
budget conscious price.
[SPEAKER_10]: They go and try it and they think,
oh, maybe I'm building up a tolerance to
[SPEAKER_10]: this variety.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't really like it as much.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it takes away from the market share of
someone who is actually creating a real
[SPEAKER_10]: variety.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's unfortunate because it's,
again, just leading to more misinformation
[SPEAKER_10]: and more problems within the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's always been the way it was.
[SPEAKER_13]: The names travel faster on the Internet
than the cuttings do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mean, this was happening back with
Skunk and Northern Lights, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Those names would be in the magazine and
someone would take that name and put it on
[SPEAKER_13]: a on a flower that they had that wasn't
selling.
[SPEAKER_13]: And in that new market, people come to
believe that that's the skunk one or the
[SPEAKER_13]: Northern Lights, the cookies or whatever
the name is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I know I harp on this a
lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Talk about plant registrations.
[SPEAKER_13]: But this is one of the things that plants
registration solves, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the name is granted to the PBR
holder upon registration.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's like, you know, somebody in
Holland, one of the seed companies years
[SPEAKER_13]: ago, ran around and tried to to register
all these names as commercial trademarks.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's copyright.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's copyright.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was made recently, like literally
recently.
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone did this with Hayes.
[SPEAKER_13]: This was like in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the 90s.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they came and actually tried to
enforce all these things.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Sam had actually put some of these
varieties through the PBR process,
[SPEAKER_13]: not with the intent to profit from them,
but in a sense to keep them in the public
[SPEAKER_13]: domain so that nobody could do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so but yeah, like in the registration
process, when you get a registration is
[SPEAKER_13]: granted to a plant breeder, that's how a
plant gets its name.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And how a plant product gets his name.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can walk into a grocery store in
New York City or L.A.
[SPEAKER_13]: or Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_13]: or anywhere in Canada or even anywhere in
Europe and get a Granny Smith apple.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're the same plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: All the same plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to wrap up real quick, but that
those are two different things.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the plant variety protection gives the
name assigned to that patent or plant
[SPEAKER_08]: variety protection, but it doesn't give it
the name in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a trademark.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not for an apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but the trademark is not as high as a
plant breeder's right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like if it went to somebody, if somebody
tried to take it, the trademark will lose.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The trademark lasts in the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: The patent patents expire.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trademarks don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the reason that that Granny Smith or
the the the power behind the name with a
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, an apple variety is the
trademark name.
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the patent, it could be in the
application as a name and that name is
[SPEAKER_08]: defendable in court.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the marketplace, in terms of
interstate commerce and how it's traded,
[SPEAKER_08]: at least in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: with the patent, that's handled by the
trademark office.
[SPEAKER_08]: And trademarks aren't allowed or aren't
granted to cannabis at all in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: But patents are granted to cannabis in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you have to remember, Mojave,
as well, that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: is like the only place other than
Australia that recognizes plant patents.
[SPEAKER_13]: This thing is not done through these
things are not done through patents
[SPEAKER_13]: outside of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the PBR is the dominant system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The copyright doesn't hold up nothing to a
plant breeder's right in the EU and Canada
[SPEAKER_03]: and in most of the civilized world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You couldn't you couldn't you couldn't
take a name of a plant of a sorry,
[SPEAKER_13]: a PBR protected variety and try to apply
it to a good you'd lose in court.
[SPEAKER_08]: But my point is in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: right now, anybody can call any plant
anything they want legally.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no protection against that
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I think to the speaker's point,
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, these these you're exactly
right.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the marketplace, people do go out and
do these things because these varieties
[SPEAKER_13]: are not protected.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not registered varieties.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so essentially, we take these plants
and give them a name and you release them
[SPEAKER_13]: into the public domain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what happens happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't attach a name to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it has a name.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a name in the application.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can't in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't claim any name to it legally.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Mojave, look at it in the in our chat.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just posted exactly what Ryan just said.
[SPEAKER_11]: This gives way to exactly what I posted
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy just took a haze plant was like,
now it's unique flower original haze.
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually communicated with the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was there was Sam Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Original Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Original Hayes was the name given it to do
it by the breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the name I stuck with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a Neville's original haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a greenhouse original haze or
haze, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they use the word original.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got to remember, too, a patent is
granted.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's not the final ruling on if you
actually own that piece of intellectual
[SPEAKER_13]: property.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of like a stake in the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like someone saying, hey,
I own this thing that there is an entire
[SPEAKER_13]: process for challenging patents.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, essentially the court
system deals with just that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that although that that guy has staked,
you know, something in the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, and even like nobody concerned
nobody has appealed it yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was to appeal it, I bet you I could
knock it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have no interest in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, let the stupid people do what
stupid people do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so far.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: The important the important thing is that
they become talking points and we use them
[SPEAKER_13]: for education.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, yeah, you know, when we do those
first patents with with Napro or the BHC
[SPEAKER_13]: group or whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody was pretty upset about that
whole thing, but it really spurred people
[SPEAKER_13]: to start getting patents and don't get me
wrong, Mojave, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: being in the United States and having that
patent that plant patent certificate is
[SPEAKER_13]: actually a pretty impressive thing because
it typically even in, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: in PBR countries, chemical profile is not
enough to register a variety is different.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's done on morphological trace.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it really allows that patent system in
the United States allows it kind of fits
[SPEAKER_13]: the niche of what cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you can find these new plants that
are chemically unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: You power plant breeders rights has not
grown up to the real world of the
[SPEAKER_03]: importance of terpenes and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they will.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to mention, too,
that I got my first you power plant
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders rights in 1997.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had applied maybe a year or two earlier,
but in 97, they were granted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was the first one in the world to
get a drug variety with plant breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: rights.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't do it because we thought,
I mean, we did it just as a as a process,
[SPEAKER_08]: just like be adults about cannabis and see
what it would be like.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also got a variety protected
through UPOB as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also say, Sam, you probably were
the one who helped us do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we got the enforcement division behind
it as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we got the Dutch group.
[SPEAKER_08]: The name fleets me right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they basically so we have the UPOB
protected plant and we have a group that
[SPEAKER_08]: will enforce that protection all around
the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have offices in every agricultural
region around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I'm I'm the one that that showed
these people I had worked with them for a
[SPEAKER_03]: really long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ryan knows them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So does Rob.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've taken both of them to visit with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they she her office, she was on the
UPOB board.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's the one who kept saying they
will change, they will add chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: profile, they will add terpene,
etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it still hasn't broken through to UPOB
yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas in patents, it is all it takes is
someone with the money to apply to to
[SPEAKER_13]: essentially do the process to have them
change the system.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's it's actually the type of thing that
would be really nice if everybody buy
[SPEAKER_13]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all know it needs to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it hasn't changed yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what does everyone think of like a
canapedia, prior art, registering,
[SPEAKER_11]: sequencing?
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that helpful for for the people
out there that don't have access to,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, filing their novel plants and,
you know, is that even helpful for people,
[SPEAKER_11]: in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I I go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's helpful to understand
relationships between things.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's it's neat to see that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's just such a large picture
being missed there at times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm for all cannabis science, regardless
of their motivation, regardless of
[SPEAKER_03]: anything I want to know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think the question, though,
is it a useful system to be able to defend
[SPEAKER_13]: intellectual property?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think other than being able to say
I have a timestamp on this with this
[SPEAKER_13]: genetic at this point in time is helpful.
[SPEAKER_13]: But even that doesn't tell the whole
story.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like that doesn't prove development and it
doesn't prove ownership.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's again, it's something
that happens in the cannabis industry a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: People feel that they people feel that
they can't participate in the legal
[SPEAKER_13]: system.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they run around and they try to
come up with reasons why they're going to
[SPEAKER_13]: develop their own system.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, everybody should do what
they want to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it becomes essentially like it's it
becomes opt in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And an opt in system when it comes to
enforcement is fucking useless.
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not worth it's totally useless.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's that's why having like like
like Mahabey said, when you get the
[SPEAKER_13]: registration and then you sign a contract
with a company that is that takes on
[SPEAKER_13]: responsibility of enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like a patent, patents can cost a
bloody fortune to defend if you get a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of opposition with the same thing with
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a breeder's rights to a
particular variety and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: other people have copies of that variety
and are growing it and selling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you, going after them ain't
cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I give you my poor man's IP tip?
[SPEAKER_08]: And and and I think this really would
work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of all the different like plant
registration, non-protected plant
[SPEAKER_08]: registration, herbarium slash kind of send
us in your sample, phylose, whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the one thing that I've done for
about 10 years that is, I think,
[SPEAKER_08]: foolproof is freezing your cotyledon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's like mailing your your songs to
yourself, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but even better, though,
because it shows that you were the person
[SPEAKER_08]: who handled that seed that brilliant.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really think.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a smart idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't heard that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that way, sure, you don't have IP.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, it's not enforceable.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if anyone like like Sam says,
enforcing a patent like I have a patent,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I don't have a team of lawyers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if someone wanted to challenge me and
like and just steal my my plant,
[SPEAKER_08]: they would get away with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They could outspend me easily.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been outspent before by people who
ripped me off, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But so then you're in court and then you
pull out your little.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, OK, well, did you plant the seed?
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, then do you have these little leaf
tissue?
[SPEAKER_08]: Things that show it came off of a little
seedling.
[SPEAKER_13]: But so then say they reach into their bag
and they've developed the breeding
[SPEAKER_13]: technology allows them to have your plant
material in their seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you prove that it came from yours?
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
Like.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trouble is that there's sharks in
minnows.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all minnows and the sharks are out
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like the music industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you know, when you show a song
to someone, it's like that chorus or verse
[SPEAKER_11]: may end up in like 20 other songs in a
session.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And before yours even gets out,
you're like, shit, I showed that guy that,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely seems to be part of human
nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly part of the cannabis industry's
nature.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was not doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there was no other nature.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not like there were germplasm
institutes and places doing it right.
[SPEAKER_12]: That, you know, Sam had to go around and
actually, you know, fund and support them
[SPEAKER_12]: and make those a reality as well as
others.
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, you know, what would we have of
it?
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Grock Treaty is now the treaty of the
of and the reality that we experience.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what if it hadn't been for the Aryans
and drunkards and others?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and to tell you the truth,
when I collected seeds starting in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 70s, there weren't none of these laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could legally go collect land races,
bring them to California, reproduce them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sell them, do whatever I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's better that there is a
regulation and that the caretakers and the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders and the original farmers should
get some sort of piece of the pie.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that sounds right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you were collecting seeds,
so you've said this a few times over the
[SPEAKER_11]: years where they're literally,
I mean, basically what you're saying to me
[SPEAKER_11]: and what I'm hearing all distilled all the
way down is all the seeds that we have,
[SPEAKER_11]: we shouldn't technically have because
we've stolen them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: As a community.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not 1000 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is it then?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that's probably true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, it's exactly like colonialism.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you were born in America.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're an American citizen, but your
genetic roots come from there.
[SPEAKER_13]: You you are essentially a seed of the evil
spawn of colonialism.
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that mean you're wrong or you can't
exist?
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, like I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you owe the blacks a bunch of money
because you're white?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you owe the American Indians a bunch of
money because you're white?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a hard nut to crack.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's an interesting thing is that in a
lot of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So more, I think more cannabis germplasm
came from export than from people sourcing
[SPEAKER_08]: it from location.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they exported illegal weed and us
peasants collected the seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that that to me forced upon us is
what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was forced upon us, really.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It showed up in my back door and little
pellets fell out and I put them in the
[SPEAKER_08]: ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, but but interestingly,
I think a big narrative is that we went
[SPEAKER_08]: out into the world and brought these seeds
back.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think fewer that's Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's very few Sam's in the world
that actually went there and got seed
[SPEAKER_08]: where most of the germplasm came in the
form of flour or being shipped to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam's today than there was 30,
40 years ago, because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people out there going and collecting land
races and trying to profit from them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I really like the philosophy of the
of you, Paul.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is, yes, the things that you can
develop.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have the right to commercially profit
from them.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you use the system and you do get a
registration, for example, you have to
[SPEAKER_13]: make that variety available for home use.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to make it available for other
breeders.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: They can't just knock it off and sell the
same thing that you created, but they can
[SPEAKER_13]: use it in the development of future plant
varieties.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason is that that plant genetic
resources are or should be available to
[SPEAKER_13]: all of humanity.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like plant genetic resources themselves
should not be owned by a corporation or an
[SPEAKER_13]: individual.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, you can benefit a period of time
from the from the developments that you
[SPEAKER_13]: make from those resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some countries, you have to give the
original breeder of a variety that is used
[SPEAKER_03]: to create subsequent varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to give them a portion of the
profits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other in other countries, it's not allowed
without the breeder's rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the breeder can say you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of different iterations
of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's that's one of the real
differences about the patent is that when
[SPEAKER_13]: you actually have the patent, you don't
have to make those plants available to
[SPEAKER_13]: other people.
[SPEAKER_13]: They are the corporate property of
whatever entity registered them or holds
[SPEAKER_13]: the patent.
Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very different route of the system
is what it is.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's yeah, it is right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's other systems around us like
the music industry that live and die by
[SPEAKER_11]: that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't sample an artist without them
saying, OK, and going through their state
[SPEAKER_11]: or them personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do it if you get caught.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's really easy to do it,
you know, to, you know, or you have,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, for me, I've sampled people and
then I have to go into the session and
[SPEAKER_11]: basically mimic it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And recreate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's it goes with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that because it holds people to a
standard and it keeps our you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: we were talking about earlier in the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we're talking about the history
intact, like there's a historical
[SPEAKER_11]: reference here where this began and why
and here's where it's going.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that person and that that legacy is
along with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd love to see Sam get, you know,
in this, you know, in the same light
[SPEAKER_11]: residuals.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not why I did it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason I produced millions and
millions and millions of seeds was because
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to change the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to do that, there needed to be seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There needed to be clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: There needed to be artificial lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that the world has changed,
let's finish the job and make it so
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody anywhere can grow for any
reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, hell with all the
naysayers.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's another little lesson in there as
well about Plan IP.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you sell seeds, you've given away the
rights.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: You haven't.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's you know, if people are really
truly concerned about owning these things,
[SPEAKER_13]: they shouldn't be selling the seeds and
just be aware that if you are selling the
[SPEAKER_13]: seeds, you can kiss your rights goodbye
because you sell those rights when you
[SPEAKER_13]: sell the seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's an important distinction to
understand.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's up in there, Davis.
[SPEAKER_09]: You had your hand up for a while now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to comment on the idea
about land races again, that like they
[SPEAKER_10]: were stolen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I think there are situations where
people didn't have permission or
[SPEAKER_10]: ultimately made it through some nefarious
means to get the opportunity to take them.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, I've got five contacts,
three are family friends of mine,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is where I've sourced and developed
my germplasm library.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can speak for my family friends that
are preservationists and very much into
[SPEAKER_10]: preservation of culture, history,
all of that, not just into cannabis,
[SPEAKER_10]: that they want to make sure that the
information from those regions,
[SPEAKER_10]: the type of culture gets recognized and
ultimately like the hardships and
[SPEAKER_10]: everything that's associated because in a
lot of these regions that are isolated,
[SPEAKER_10]: that there still is, you know,
cannabis cultivation that hasn't been
[SPEAKER_10]: alterated, adulterated.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to state while I'm saying that
some of these areas likely have had
[SPEAKER_10]: adulteration over decades or even.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were those seeds from imported into the
United States or were they coming from
[SPEAKER_03]: different countries?
[SPEAKER_10]: They're coming from different countries
originally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I guess that's fair to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm always just making the point that
there's no buts about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't go through the UN treaty,
biodiversity, the negama treaties,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, and the newer one, it's
illegal.
OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the thing is that those those
reality that we have had and we exist
[SPEAKER_12]: under and now it's going to be an
interesting fight.
[SPEAKER_12]: Currently, that treaty, the Grok treaty,
Michael, I believe is being tested by neem
[SPEAKER_12]: and India.
[SPEAKER_12]: India is going after people who extracted
and took neem.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is going to be the first kind of
world test case specifically under the new
[SPEAKER_12]: treaty.
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I correct on that, Michael?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're following that more than I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a new frontier, people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: What what what has existed and what does
exist is is down a new pathway.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is the air of responsibility that
we're talking about that has been
[SPEAKER_12]: deflected for generations now has to come
home to roost.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it's it's a new day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're looking forward to seeing what
happens, who rises to the occasion.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as stated, you know, India is taking
its first step and it's around neem and
[SPEAKER_12]: neem is a type of tree that you can
express, press the oil out of the leaves
[SPEAKER_12]: and has been used.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I have used it as a, you know,
a natural disinfectant or cleaner of
[SPEAKER_12]: plants and gardens.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's going to be interesting to see
because no one has gone this way with
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: But now there is precedence and somebody
is going to fly and run with that flag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with neem, too, it's been used for
thousands of years as a toothbrush in
[SPEAKER_03]: India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the stems.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to say, if you're in if you're in
Canada and those seeds came into the
[SPEAKER_13]: country, Canada is not a signatory to the
Nagoya Protocol.
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, it comes down to enforcement
unless you were like advertising it as
[SPEAKER_13]: directly from, you know, a certain certain
population down in South America.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no enforcement action to go after
you because Canada is not part of a
[SPEAKER_13]: signatory to the party.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And even even within the Nagoya Protocol,
it's more about systems and less about
[SPEAKER_13]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like there is no real enforcement arm to
the treaty.
[SPEAKER_13]: So like if you violate the rules,
there's nobody to come after you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's like this again, what I was
saying, like these systems are kind of to
[SPEAKER_13]: a degree, they're opt in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, Holland is in a different boat.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Holland is a signatory signatory
to these treaties.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think all European nations are.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, sure, maybe that could
affect trade of that variety in Europe,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it won't in Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, these things aren't so cut
and dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because there's a treaty,
it doesn't mean that people aren't going
[SPEAKER_13]: to still do these things.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there's all sorts of things that
North Americans and, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: principally Canada and the United States,
which are really a lot of the offending
[SPEAKER_13]: nations in these cases.
[SPEAKER_13]: The government just said hell no.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not signing on to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Holland's not so holy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, remember where the tulip came
from?
[SPEAKER_03]: It came from Turkey or that general area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Holland is the one who took to them to
its heights.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have I have a vision of hopefully not
too naive vision that these large
[SPEAKER_05]: interests, you know, huge corporate
interests and individual, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: small societies of growth powers,
indigenous peoples, craft growers,
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional medicine people, et cetera,
can not just sort of exist, coexist,
[SPEAKER_05]: but actually really support each other
that I would contend colonialism took
[SPEAKER_05]: great products and drove them into the
ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to have sustainability,
you need to maintain that conduit between
[SPEAKER_05]: the source and the end product.
[SPEAKER_05]: The corporations that have tried to get
away from that and create their own
[SPEAKER_05]: universe have really blisteringly failed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the Monsanto model is not doing
too well in our modern age.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's more like gold fruit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's funny because Europe has all
these rules about you're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_13]: import plant products, like products of
plant varieties that aren't registered.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when it comes to cannabis,
they're importing all sorts of
[SPEAKER_13]: unregistered varieties.
[SPEAKER_13]: And right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody even says anything about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like it's that should change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully that that's ATN saying hopefully
that that's the new frontier.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's hard to say who will put
their first toe on that line.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the emergence of international
regulated medicinal cannabis markets and
[SPEAKER_05]: sales is a good first step.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like the United States,
it's like trying to tie up, try together
[SPEAKER_13]: all these patchwork rules that are so
different.
[SPEAKER_13]: It becomes a quilt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if any seeds are found in the legally
imported international cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: the growers here in America will use them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not sure it's legal,
but they'll use them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was going to say, there's no
guarantee that even if you go through the
[SPEAKER_08]: legal pathway that you're bringing the
most benefit to the people who should be
[SPEAKER_08]: getting that benefit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So so like right now, you've got all these
companies which are operating in a gray
[SPEAKER_08]: area in this land race, Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Nepal, India seed exchange
[SPEAKER_08]: world that's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really big.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of them are working with local
people to share the profit and to help
[SPEAKER_08]: tell the story.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of a it's a social equity
play enrolled in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But so so is that better to do it on the
grassroots level, working with the tribe
[SPEAKER_08]: in the Amazon directly versus working
through all the proper channels,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, it gets filtered out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just bringing that up,
because some of the people that are doing
[SPEAKER_08]: this, I feel are ethical, you know,
and they're going there, they're going
[SPEAKER_08]: like, look, I'm going to go to Nepal,
I'm going to source seeds, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_08]: sell them in the US, I'm going to give
share profit with the people in Nepal,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to tell their story,
I'm going to, you know, but they're doing
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're totally violating the Plant
Protection Act, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, it's like, which which rules
are we being okay, so we go by the ethical
[SPEAKER_13]: rules of what we decide is right for the
original peoples.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we totally ignore the cosmic brother
law.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we totally ignore the rules of the
government, you know, that puts these laws
[SPEAKER_13]: in place for for like protection of the
industry, you know, protecting the
[SPEAKER_13]: industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was saying this, like in 2017,
in Canada, we were importing stuff into
[SPEAKER_13]: the Canadian system and everything that we
brought in had to go through
[SPEAKER_13]: phytosanitary.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you get these cowboys that are
bringing stuff up from the United States.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's got it's a clone of the hot
name.
[SPEAKER_13]: And by the way, it also has like cyclamen,
russon mites, and hoplite and viroid,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_13]: And all hoplite and viroids running like a
hot fire going through everybody's grow
[SPEAKER_13]: room.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, what do you think that cost?
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think that cost the industry?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's still costing the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the number what has been lost due
to that, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not saying that like, you know,
all government relate regulation should be
[SPEAKER_13]: followed to a T.
[SPEAKER_13]: But like, they're, they're put in for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we operate outside of those
systems, there's consequences.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, you know, these are these are
really complex discussions with so many
[SPEAKER_13]: things to take into account.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it almost feels like we have these
discussions turn into, oh, it's a big
[SPEAKER_13]: complicated thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just keep doing what we're doing.
Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, it's a it's a it's there's too much
friction there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just keep going along with the
status quo.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we also can recognize that
it's also not the way to go, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: we have to evolve, we have to be willing
to evolve.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to, you know, yeah, it's a
complicated one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I think it I think this pivots
very well into Brian's conversation today,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is this blight.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it kind of talks to the other side of
breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're putting plants together,
like maybe make a point on getting rid of
[SPEAKER_09]: some of these things that are susceptible
to viroids and diseases and back,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, all of these things.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Brian, ever so patient, my friend,
you are definitely patient three hours,
[SPEAKER_09]: 12 minutes, but you're up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thankful there's so much information
at hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking notes over here, just
listening, kind of trying to saturate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's really a lot and it
all so much applies to like what we all do
[SPEAKER_04]: and definitely what I'm doing here on the
field in Maine, inside and out and follows
[SPEAKER_04]: along well with the other episodes kind of
chaining into this one here to a good
[SPEAKER_04]: rhythm.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was even taking some notes of my
own, just kind of mentioning for here in
[SPEAKER_04]: Maine, like with my breeding outside,
I've been breeding outside for years now
[SPEAKER_04]: and kind of sticking it to that realm.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in Maine, in typical fashion,
I've usually paid attention to like smell
[SPEAKER_04]: upfront when I'm breeding for the Terps
showing early.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll go for what I call two week Terps,
but I've also followed it with like a
[SPEAKER_04]: taste to effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd look at the look thereafter even,
and just more go for smell upfront,
[SPEAKER_04]: really good taste into the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then leading into other areas too,
but for outside, why I breed outside is
[SPEAKER_04]: because of the health and resistance
factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking for overall health in the
past years, this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'd say for, I guess about the
past four years, we've had this Septoria
[SPEAKER_04]: challenge is what I've heard it's called.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Colin has ideas or some information
and I can kind of report from the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm seeing results as far as like types
that will make it types that definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a list going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely have a library happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing about a 10% carry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from like my clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the library, a 10% hold on what makes
it and continued resistance year to year
[SPEAKER_04]: as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm definitely seeing a lot of damage
and I'm seeing some new types that are
[SPEAKER_04]: showing faces.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm even, you know, for the defense,
I've seen some stuff kick into defense
[SPEAKER_04]: later on now, like as it switches to
fungal in the root zone from the
[SPEAKER_04]: vegetative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems to carry on a health fighter
resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've also, I'm learning a lot about,
I don't know much about it, but I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: learning from the field about Septoria,
at least here in Maine, I'm hearing it's
[SPEAKER_04]: hitting other areas like, you know,
New York, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's not been talked about yet
enough and much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of elephant in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this stuff's a wipe out quicker damage
than I've seen anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen different forms of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking to, you know, like not
scientists, but soil pros here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're just discussing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's chats going on today locally even,
and it's, it's pulling off a good enough
[SPEAKER_04]: product at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely affecting yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hash is coming out still really good,
even through some of the like strip it
[SPEAKER_04]: off, get it right down to bear.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flower seems to be kind of,
for some reason into the portion,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, into flowering, it seems to fade
or not have as much of a hold,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it wants to kill the plant leaf off
and live again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've definitely seen it this year go
for like a drive down to the soil through
[SPEAKER_04]: a systemic carry, which seems to behave
like a micro plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is where it would maybe
open up to some conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard that trichoderma is being
applied to several forms out of some
[SPEAKER_04]: people in New York actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't dug into it, but I mean,
it makes sense to me, but I want to kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of open it up to see what people think.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, it's kind of looking for
perhaps like a fighter or an isolated
[SPEAKER_04]: strain or strains of fungal that are still
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it would be something that
would be more beneficial or non-harming to
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant that would actually perhaps be
able to inoculate into the compost,
[SPEAKER_04]: inoculate around.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just to share it from the field
reporting back, I'm definitely walking in
[SPEAKER_04]: the woods and I see this stuff changing
our landscape.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's taking trees down in the woods,
certain type, you know, like quick growing
[SPEAKER_04]: alder poplar, there's maples or oaks
affected, and it's changing the landscape.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just haven't heard that much about
this getting opened up yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would hope to open it up to some
people here for knowledge or information
[SPEAKER_04]: sharing, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the East Coast, I've noticed it on
native plants all over the place.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I never saw that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You and I both grew up on the East Coast
and have been growing cannabis for close
[SPEAKER_11]: to 30 years out here now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, yeah, sartoria has been a big
issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: That has just devastated New York County.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a lot of the people that I've
spoken to at scale were hemp farming first
[SPEAKER_11]: and transitioned into drug cultivars and
then planting in those same fields season
[SPEAKER_11]: after season and not taking the right
precautions to amend their soils and
[SPEAKER_11]: create a healthy soil network for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's been devastating on the East
Coast, but it's the biggest reason why New
[SPEAKER_11]: York's market has so much terrible herb is
because of the soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: That these individuals are growing in
most, not everyone, but a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_11]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they have these viroids and they're not
testing or fielding for them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where I do think that genomics
does come through and help you get better
[SPEAKER_11]: insight.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the plant up taking this by the soil
and that's how it's becoming infected?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't call them anymore,
but I heard it first.
[SPEAKER_04]: The theory being is that it's a splash
back from the top surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I had disturbed the top soil just
through simple hand cultivation of the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil, I did some, I've been doing some
trying some like more simple and organic
[SPEAKER_04]: application or even natural, you know,
like disturbed top soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to break up a fungal web that
exists that lasts for about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it kicks up again, fresh,
good fungal rich compost on top fights
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, at this year, at this point,
year four, I'm throwing several different
[SPEAKER_04]: types of compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: From professionals, our own, that's
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, different natural sulfur is
being applied several times.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other oil to a pH balance,
citric application for spray that doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: seem to touch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kelp doesn't seem to do much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if this is answering any
of your question, but it's back to this,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe Colin knows, but it's kind of like
throwing all the natural format.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be driven kind of deep
systemically down into the soil at this
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, you know, pythium is a huge problem
and lettuce, chlorosis, viroid is starting
[SPEAKER_11]: to become prevalent, which is not,
I think we can all agree has not been a
[SPEAKER_11]: major threat.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I mean, we've used, you know,
mycorrhizal top dressings to help combat
[SPEAKER_11]: it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We seem to think that, you know,
disrupting the soil to, like you said,
[SPEAKER_11]: to not allow that network to develop has
really helped.
[SPEAKER_11]: But honestly, we just call the plants like
immediately when we see it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we start soil testing,
send that to New England testing labs,
[SPEAKER_11]: look at what's going on.
[SPEAKER_12]: What does it visually look like?
[SPEAKER_12]: So if somebody is watching, you have a
visual representation about what this
[SPEAKER_12]: looks like potentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have one right off hand to show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have, I'll try to get some
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got brown spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like rust.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it on the leaf or on the stem?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the leaves that I remember.
[SPEAKER_12]: Old leaves or old leaves, not on new
leaves?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on older and it's actually hitting
up high on the plant on new leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's behaving differently through the
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It even has different form, which seems to
me, just again, from the field seems like
[SPEAKER_04]: different species of that one type of
fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've kind of heard a little word about
that from a soil friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've definitely seen like tight yellow
spotting that's really dense spotting on
[SPEAKER_04]: the lower leaves seems to be where that
one lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're going to see some,
you know, holes in the actual leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost look like something's eating it
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems like a different form.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this stuff sounds nasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants are spread by insects, but they're
also spread by soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're moving clones around or if
you're moving, the problem is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is it's wiping out trees in nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got 78 plus acres and I'm walking the
back 40 down for miles back here,
[SPEAKER_04]: driving by where my parents live in the
hills.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hearing from friends in Midwest,
different States and not denying that it
[SPEAKER_04]: does carry to soil, but I, you know,
one of the things I pride myself into some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the most beautiful living soil,
my compost is so rich that it's actually
[SPEAKER_04]: the newer compost is growing blight free,
you know, squash plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That don't seem to get hit in the pure
compost and they're thriving, but I'm also
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of like, what chance do they have?
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as they take a little bit of a
yellow off, they go to this quickly and
[SPEAKER_04]: the trees out in nature, literally some of
them I've seen last year, even some 20
[SPEAKER_04]: foot trees that are younger falling right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gone, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seems to be really, even if I could
isolate here, change over soil diff,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried different strains and different
parts of the farm of the yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: On about a 10, 12 acre clean out here in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm seeing it still pop different
areas, but I'm also seeing the resistant
[SPEAKER_04]: type or two or a few that do the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid I can't quite remember as well
as I used to, but is Trichoderma valuable
[SPEAKER_03]: to fight this?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't applied it yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've used in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful to hear that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's coming in the mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's three different strains that are
being toyed with out of New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll connect with you on that call in
a bit after too, and talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably nearby with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: We saw it even indoors, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had to do a lot of soil searching
in the facility to figure out what was
[SPEAKER_11]: going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we, you know, for whatever reason,
because the facility was near the coast,
[SPEAKER_11]: the water had this weird film,
even when it was run through our,
[SPEAKER_11]: it was just the weirdest thing we've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen it inside here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't carried over for myself or
friends in the area.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we nipped it in the bud,
but you know, there's also, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: a little bit of, you know, good old Clorox
bleach in the rez.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, to kill anything at the right
rates.
[SPEAKER_11]: What does this do to the roots?
[SPEAKER_11]: So what does it do to the ground?
[SPEAKER_11]: So the plant could be completely healthy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's like a huge branch that's
just like dead.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're like, huh, that's the weirdest
thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is that whole branch just dying?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's signifiers like splay in
spots that can happen as well,
[SPEAKER_11]: but that's further.
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like that's further.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the leaves get crispy and kind of
acrid and kind of like the plants are
[SPEAKER_11]: almost, you know, deep into fall.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, finishing itself off with lots
of ethylene around.
[SPEAKER_11]: Say that again, one more time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a leaf necrosis, would it be
called?
[SPEAKER_04]: It does like a die off, like you just
said.
[SPEAKER_11]: It feels like the plant wants to produce
ethylene and it just like signifies it all
[SPEAKER_11]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it affects the other,
if you have like other plants in the room,
[SPEAKER_11]: it starts to affect them because of the
ethylene levels.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really fascinating seeing it
happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, we found, again,
it's just like, you have to be really
[SPEAKER_11]: diligent about cleaning everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta be really tight on you on
everything and just make sure you're
[SPEAKER_11]: double backing on all your SOPs and
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could share a little info from the field
on that note, which seems to help out
[SPEAKER_04]: actually is like we're using local hay
mulch and a thick cover local hay mulch on
[SPEAKER_04]: the bottom that's kept with a fresh change
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the four by four square on the
raised bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gets where it actually almost acts like a
catch for the for the leaf fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what I've seen this this blight
work like it seems to its its
[SPEAKER_04]: intelligence, at least in its life cycle,
seems to want to do a leaf kill off on the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, just tracking it wise to let him
go bad to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does a drop down of the leaves right to
the base of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from what I've seen or heard,
those are asexual reproduction sites that
[SPEAKER_04]: look like rust spots on the leaf when it
dies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those spots Sam was talking about gray
spots and it fluffs off the spore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it definitely seems like it wants to
kill those leaves right off and behave
[SPEAKER_04]: where it wants to catch water,
live right there and spread from there to
[SPEAKER_04]: go systemic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like a fresh turnover of of mulch under
the plant where you can actually keep the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants as clean as you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, this lens so far into at least
in Maine, where it's a more small batch
[SPEAKER_04]: type of feel anyway, and by numbers,
by medical allowance and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's creating like a 10 year plants better
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I when I kind of listen to the
plants, they're going kick up the
[SPEAKER_04]: stewardship, you know, don't have us like
on said, take us out, change it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't new soil, new area or don't do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's becoming like if less is more and
that's what we can handle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely seems like healthy fungal
population, a good constant nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: availability to it, whether organic or
not, and not letting them, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: go without and be overboard over the
threshold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really kind of maybe testing the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems to me with just so many
plants out there in general of all types
[SPEAKER_04]: with colors and, you know, these different
rules to it in all realms.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like this is just kind of an
almost natural thing, no matter where it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for this to kind of call,
like you said, call the plant and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to seemingly call down the breeding,
at least to bring up this conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just going to be breeding gone
wild and F1 poly hybrids everywhere,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, selling his hotcakes,
because this is like year five in Maine
[SPEAKER_04]: that this stuff is taking a serious hold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this year being a good grow year,
but a high humid one, you saw good growth,
[SPEAKER_04]: early start off for health in places with
people that were bragging, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: raving about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they quiet fall off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like detriment to the point of
having a meeting over it, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's really if you don't have it,
it seems like at least I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: probably East Coast, it's going to come
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one of those things cycling.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's eventually going to come.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at this point, it's a more how do we
resist this, in my opinion, and seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: like the 10% hold from new faces from
breeding and from the library hold of
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics, at least where I'm here in small
batch application, not field trials for
[SPEAKER_04]: thousands or millions of thousands of
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm able to see that hold and then try it
out different zones through the years and
[SPEAKER_04]: then protect my genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hold it, you know, as close as I
can, because it works well for here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also kind of tearing stripping
away like the candy shop approach of
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene exploration, or, you know,
just into hashing it washes, it's becoming
[SPEAKER_04]: one of those where it's actually going to
have more boxes to check when it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: sun grown out here, you know, whether it's
personal grow, or whether it would be a
[SPEAKER_04]: production grow, I feel, because,
you know, both angles are affected.
[SPEAKER_04]: The home grower that that has this blight
run wild thing going on to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: very crazy is going to have a difficult
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess going back to trying to find
the plants, at least from the breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: from the field and simple understanding
perspective, hold them well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm obviously like working into
the year here with my breeding to be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: resistant males that show, you know,
the traits even a kickback later for
[SPEAKER_04]: health one upfront, I'm tracking them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then coming back to the proven females
that either over the years, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: or a new type that showing its face to be
the healthiest new girl and the new lady
[SPEAKER_04]: in the yard is strawberry smoothie band
that I'm calling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So strawberry headband on a citrus
smoothie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just looks I mean, it sticks out
even among some of the plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and any who that's kind of like,
from the field.
[SPEAKER_09]: So somebody, sorry, sorry, I just wanted
to mention one thing at 10 that Wade had
[SPEAKER_09]: his hand up, but he has turned his camera
off now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So okay, awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't know if he's there now.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when he comes back and turns his
camera on, we'll give him the floor.
[SPEAKER_09]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had to take a leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: What to do, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta jump in here and rant for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I keep thinking about what Mojave
brought up about flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how he was really pointing to what I
think is kind of a central problem in the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole cannabis space where the various
operators try and provide product,
[SPEAKER_00]: ethical operators try and provide product
that the consumer wants because the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer has been educated, if you will,
to call out for this specific version of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a patient, I got to keep coming
back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a patient, historically, we followed
flavor and smell and morphology as a guide
[SPEAKER_00]: to the chemistry that we were seeking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have analytical chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a wonderful gift to our search.
[SPEAKER_00]: But part of what I wanted to rant about is
we also talked about hemp and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences of, shall we say,
unskillful legislation that has happened
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States around the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the one hand, hemp has had the
effect of normalizing cannabis all across
[SPEAKER_00]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are used to it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of it, and to me,
the biggest problem, again, as a patient
[SPEAKER_00]: and as a consumer, there's no protections
for consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess part of what I'm trying to do
here is I'm asking you, all of you on this
[SPEAKER_00]: panel and anyone who's listening to this
recording, to recognize that if you view
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself as an ethical operator,
it's important to create product that
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfies the consumer while ideally
preserving the beneficial effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis other than the drug high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, as a drug user myself, I love the
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've also become a fairly passionate
user of cannabis for its medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, the whole thing of
legalization, we wouldn't be here if it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't for the medicinal benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, flavor guided us for many years
to that medicinal benefit that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: seeking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm calling on, again, those of us who
are ethical operators to preserve the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that you have, to cull out the
thing that's specific and the other big
[SPEAKER_00]: topic is these various pathogens that
threaten this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know the global plant isn't
really threatened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really talking about the commercial
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm going to stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it really strongly that if you know
what you're doing with this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: do it with your heart and your
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the forefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when he says things, it sticks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Alex Hardy in the chat was also suggesting
kombucha and airflow for septoria.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a barbarist who's in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was his suggestion.
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for that, Mr. Hardy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Airflow for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a new one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Kombucha makes sense, though.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a gentleman reach out to me recently
from Estonia, and he had a couple of
[SPEAKER_09]: interesting things to share.
[SPEAKER_09]: The one is just another new method of
isolating trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure we'll be speaking about it in the
very near future.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the other one was he had this product.
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't say the name yet, but we'll let
you know in the near future here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was talking about maybe coming and
visiting Canada and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: and maybe getting some of this product to
people who had HLVD.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was just talking to him while we've
had this conversation, and he was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh, septoria.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if it's bacteria and fungal
problems, it's much easier to prevent and
[SPEAKER_09]: cure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I sent you that email, Brian,
and maybe we'll make it so you can get
[SPEAKER_09]: some of that product to see if you can't
combat that.
Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying some.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we got 26,000 minutes left before we
hit the four hour mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: What a great conversation today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm definitely down to freestyle for
another 26 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, if I haven't said it once
already, I appreciate all of you for
[SPEAKER_09]: showing up.
[SPEAKER_09]: The heavy hitters came out today.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been great conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just it's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are appreciating it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Three hundred people watching live right
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're getting those numbers up each
week.
[SPEAKER_09]: This being our fifth week, people like
consistency.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gives them sort of, I don't know,
just makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's warm and fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like comfort food in the fall.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be consistent.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's go ahead.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Got to thank you, Marcus, because thank
you for re restarting what you started a
[SPEAKER_12]: decade ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it's I love coming here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love learning.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love hearing, I mean, opening up with
Ethan, Ethan Russo and Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it just makes my heart sing in
happiness.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so glad that we got to be here.
I'm so happy.
I'm so grateful for all of the people
working on this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think there's any kind of question
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so grateful for all of the people who
work on this, the farmers, farmers,
[SPEAKER_12]: producers, providers, from different
countries, all talking all things cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: in a very intelligent, logical yet
passionate way that is back in a root of
[SPEAKER_12]: science, which I think is most important.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I celebrate all of you and thank you
kindly for just being a small part of
[SPEAKER_12]: this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, you know, part of the
important fact is, listen, we're just
[SPEAKER_09]: we're spit ball and always we try to be as
accurate as we can.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we make mistakes and get things
wrong sometimes as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think to be a thinking human being and
share your perspective, you have to take
[SPEAKER_09]: the chance that you might make a mistake
and you might even offend someone along
[SPEAKER_09]: the way as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I like that we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that for the most part,
you guys are quite conscious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, I felt like when Wade said what he
said about, you know, leading with your
[SPEAKER_09]: heart, I feel that about most all of you,
you know, almost I would say all of you
[SPEAKER_09]: really.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know all of you personally and you lead
with your heart.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's I think authenticity
has an important place in all of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: People appreciate authenticity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what I feel a lot of when I get
together with you guys on Sunday morning
[SPEAKER_09]: and chat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I think there's a lot of
black hearted individuals, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people, their focus is monetary
return.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've met them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, that's why.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, being patients and providers has
been important for all of us.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we're able to share our
experiences with others.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this gives us an area and a way to do
so.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you're a provider.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're you provide bubble man,
you know, to Canadian providers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have various scientists on here who
are actively doing in the science that has
[SPEAKER_12]: been, you know, definitely neglected for
decades on end.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're at a unique precipice in time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there's an industry and it's all
full of sharks.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, it's the sharks have always
been there.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can see them in the water now,
but it's not going to stop the people who
[SPEAKER_12]: are doing it for the right reasons for
doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way to get rid of the sharks is
probably to take the money out of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but the sharks are in the ocean and
they're not taking over the ocean.
[SPEAKER_09]: The ocean is flourishing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just got to figure out a way to flourish.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the reason the sharks are
interested in cannabis is because they see
[SPEAKER_03]: it as an income generator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen, that's the reason a lot of people
were interested in cannabis for a very
[SPEAKER_09]: long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And albeit, I'll even say that some people
who have a much more leading with their
[SPEAKER_09]: heart perspective today would admit that
when they got into cannabis, it was to
[SPEAKER_09]: like pay for their mortgage and some other
things, you know, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: In my opinion, whatever way cannabis can
infect our souls and minds and get in
[SPEAKER_09]: there and bore in there and get us growing
it, I support it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, I'd rather see,
for example, people like ex-judges,
[SPEAKER_03]: ex-police officers, ex-prison officers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather see them being greedy and
working with cannabis than being what they
[SPEAKER_03]: were and locking cannabis people up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amen to that, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the sermon of the day.
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of want to know what are Chimera
and Stunkman Sam smoking on and what is
[SPEAKER_12]: everybody else smoking on in chat?
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't seen that in a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you all smoking on, Chimera?
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're smoking on is white albino
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's grown on alligator feces in the
sewers of New York.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually a pretty nice little rosin.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually went down to meet someone at a
coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so I had a joint of the grinspoon or
what do they, what used to be called the
[SPEAKER_13]: quays, you know, the one I'm talking about
with all the calyxes and that real bud
[SPEAKER_13]: structure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But man, I'm not a big cannabis burner.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was weird sitting there smoking this
joint that kept going out.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I was reminded myself that I was in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, speaking of, I had a thought
earlier in the show when someone put up
[SPEAKER_13]: the medicine bottle, the old medicine
bottle, I guess that was Michael,
[SPEAKER_13]: and it had, it listed the ingredients and
it was, you know, cannabis with all these
[SPEAKER_13]: other things in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it made me think when we started
talking about these botanically derived
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenes that we have a little bit of
cannabis and a lot of other stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it seems we keep doing that different
versions of that same thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I can't help but wonder if
a good regulation would be that the only
[SPEAKER_13]: thing allowed inside a cannabis product
was something derived from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: itself.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, when it comes to inhalables,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, obviously, when you're talking to
inhalables, what they'll do is they'll
[SPEAKER_03]: take cannabis products and with synthesis,
convert them into different cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: products, which I'm not so sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as long as they're safe for
consumers, but that's not proven safe.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and you know, Mark Sheldone,
like, I mean, he's developed some of these
[SPEAKER_13]: things that are synthesis products with
using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't think anything's wrong with
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that if we're developing new
things, that stuff should end up down the
[SPEAKER_13]: regulatory path of, you know, having to
show safety.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cannabis shouldn't just be something where
you can take and modify and start
[SPEAKER_13]: developing new products with unknown
health consequences and giving them to
[SPEAKER_13]: people.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the reason we know that cannabis
is safe is because there's thousands of
[SPEAKER_13]: years of us using it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, when we start totally
whacking out the ratios between those
[SPEAKER_13]: compounds and the plants and adjusting in
a different way.
[SPEAKER_09]: So does pure dry sift and bubble hash
maybe not fit into that category,
[SPEAKER_09]: Ryan?
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, really, I mean, that's the most,
the highest percentage of volatile organic
[SPEAKER_09]: compounds we've ever inhaled have been in
the last 25 to 30 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was going to... And Rosin,
you know, well, again, the way I see it
[SPEAKER_13]: with a natural product is how are you
going to stop people from doing it?
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you going to remove that right of
them to use the plant as they will?
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why I kind of, you know,
like I was going down that road when we
[SPEAKER_13]: talked about it earlier, I'm right into
like plants that are 15% THC because maybe
[SPEAKER_13]: when you make them into a hash,
they have a different ratio of the
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenoids to, you know, say you take a
high terp line, like say we're talking
[SPEAKER_13]: about that 6% terpene line that we
developed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got essentially twice as much or
more terpenoids in a ratio to
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so when you concentrate that down
naturally, you have a different ratio.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think that there is like,
when you talk about head space and,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and how your head actually feels
after consuming these products,
[SPEAKER_13]: like I really am a believer in,
you know, not everything has to be 30%
[SPEAKER_13]: plus THC in the flower.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I get the novelty of it, but it
doesn't mean that you have to make all
[SPEAKER_13]: products out of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I kind of feel like with the way that
the regulations go and the, the
[SPEAKER_13]: distributors, like the distributors want
high THC products because they know that
[SPEAKER_13]: in the past, those high THC products have
sold.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they know that they can put their
money into a whole bunch of stock on that
[SPEAKER_13]: and they're not going to lose money.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also, it's, you got to, we also,
I think we also got to recognize,
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, maybe this is the same in the
States, but definitely in Canada,
[SPEAKER_13]: the flower market is kind of going away.
[SPEAKER_13]: And more people are moving to pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so when you're in a pre-roll
environment, those consumers aren't
[SPEAKER_13]: interacting with the flower in the same
way that we do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so is that a generational thing?
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe change, maybe.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but it's not the same as rolling and
smelling.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Transforming it from a, from a bud into a
joint, that whole experience of getting it
[SPEAKER_09]: in your fingers more than you would Yeah,
it's wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's definitely a way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: I go to my daughter's, the dispensary that
she works at is a happy aisle in Horseshoe
[SPEAKER_09]: Bay, not too far from my house.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll just go visit her sometimes and
hang out for, you know, 10 or 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And every single person comes in and
they're like, do you, what do you got for
[SPEAKER_09]: like the cheapest Indica pre-roll one
gram, you know, 20%.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's very funny how they're ordering
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously this is what we fought for.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you just want it to make it
available.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I suspect that as much as we want,
and I think it's important what we're
[SPEAKER_09]: doing, stewarding these volatile organic
compound profiles and all of the breeding
[SPEAKER_09]: work that guys like Ryan and Skunkman Sam
and many other people have done.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are super important factors.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're preserving different aspects,
but that'll never change the fact that 85%
[SPEAKER_09]: or more of the industry gives like zero
fucks about any of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're happy with floor sweepings with
some distillate and botanical turps
[SPEAKER_09]: sprayed on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they just love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if you could ever fight
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and you know, Marcus, I mean,
like, you know, you're such a purist and
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, David and myself are also like
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think a lot of people on the panel are,
we're such purists that we want that
[SPEAKER_13]: absolutely finest part of the market or
not the part of the market, part of the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant and deliver that to the market with
pride and say like, Hey, this is something
[SPEAKER_13]: that I love.
[SPEAKER_13]: You should check it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're, we are like an anomaly,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like most people don't want that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And even worse in Canada, the people who
do want that stuff, like hate anything to
[SPEAKER_09]: do with government weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any of the people that have learned how to
grow their own weed and make their own
[SPEAKER_09]: hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like the one group of people that
might support you and keep you from going
[SPEAKER_09]: bankrupt in that venture of trying to
bring that to market are like specifically
[SPEAKER_09]: won't buy weed from the legal government
stores.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've noticed like the needs of the
consumers because generations socially are
[SPEAKER_11]: different.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they interact differently.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're on their phone.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're buying things quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're, you know, they're looking to put
their cart together before they even go to
[SPEAKER_11]: the dispensary and they pick the thing up
rather than even shop.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's, it's a lot of that,
you know, like to Marcus's point,
[SPEAKER_11]: like that drives a lot of the choices.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of these larger operators are making
because that's all their feedback is.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the narrative.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're, they're okay with that narrative.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's what sells, that's what we're
selling.
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys are just business.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just figuring out how to sell
product.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, you know, I just, I know that
we, some of us have been doing this so
[SPEAKER_13]: long.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, for example, I would say,
I think back with Marcus and having these
[SPEAKER_13]: incredibly strong hashes, not that they
were strong, but incredibly pure hashes
[SPEAKER_13]: and seeing people react to those medicines
through Hill's dispensary.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and you know, well, the government
looks at us and we say, Hey, we got this
[SPEAKER_13]: product that's like 50, 60, 70% TAC.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't understand that we have just
refined the best parts of the plant and
[SPEAKER_13]: removed the, you know, we've washed away
the green parts of the plant and kept the
[SPEAKER_13]: important medicine part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you give that to people in real
need, they don't have to consume all this
[SPEAKER_13]: burning plant material.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so you can do one lungful and get a
real dose.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, people like Etienne and
everybody else on this panel that's worked
[SPEAKER_13]: with people and that need cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like the pure, the stronger the
medicine, the better and more complete.
Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, when I talk like I'm
talking like you're really nice hash rosin
[SPEAKER_13]: or super refined bubble.
[SPEAKER_13]: They can use a lot less of it and it's
less harmful to them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the government comes along with
slaps and extra 20% tax on that and it
[SPEAKER_13]: makes it less competitive in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like it's just the whole way that we've
done this thing is completely backwards.
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of these lessons and these
beautiful things that we found out about
[SPEAKER_13]: the plants, I, you know, I it's,
it's just, you see the way that it's
[SPEAKER_13]: playing out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Marcus said, 80% of the people are
coming in and looking for cheap potent
[SPEAKER_13]: pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's bizarre.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also trying to mimic other industry,
which is sad because we aren't those
[SPEAKER_11]: industries, you know, and I keep saying
that to everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like, just because there's a
strawberry fair known product that could
[SPEAKER_11]: say strawberry cough, and you can use 4%
of that and it costs you 30 cents to grab
[SPEAKER_11]: and put in your vape.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can now call it strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't mean you should, you know,
and then on the flip side of that,
[SPEAKER_11]: because you struck a coin with me earlier
on the, the vape side, like what I learned
[SPEAKER_11]: from a tox point of view, like there's
tons of turps, like polygons was just
[SPEAKER_11]: blowing fruit, like polygons really toxic,
like, and that can show up in,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, very toxic levels in certain
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have to be very cognitive of that,
of that, to your point, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: as we move forward, cause there's more to
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a mono terpene or is it a
sesquiterpene?
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's a sesquiterpene.
[SPEAKER_07]: Monoterpenoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Monoterpenoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It talks about it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it'll go away quicker if you cure it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So concentrations we learned in the
medical and medicinal end is definitely
[SPEAKER_12]: all about harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_12]: And believe it or not, one of the work
that, you know, we we've been doing at the
[SPEAKER_12]: UN, we just got harm reduction put into
the UN after 20 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: 24 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: It took 24 years just to get two words
inserted into a goddamn treaty.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just so you know how long it takes some
time to make change, but yes, it's key.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had another comment about the,
again, I'm probably like a broken record
[SPEAKER_10]: on this, but we're talking about people
going into stores and asking for the
[SPEAKER_10]: stronger product.
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I think it just comes down to the
information that's accessible.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that just like a Ryan,
you're pointing out about the lower THC
[SPEAKER_10]: varieties that would be higher in terpenes
or higher in other compounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think as we progress as an industry,
ultimately people will understand that and
[SPEAKER_10]: go for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's just, you know, we're really,
even though the industry has been around
[SPEAKER_10]: for a while now, like we still really are
in the juvenile stages of it all,
[SPEAKER_10]: the juvenile understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just going to take proper education
and more people understanding it too,
[SPEAKER_10]: to get to that length and get those kinds
of products out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because yeah, like there's also as much as
people might be demanding that there's
[SPEAKER_10]: also a lot of people around me that are
saying how strong it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in terms of that being kind of like a
undesirable thing for it just to have that
[SPEAKER_10]: high potency.
[SPEAKER_10]: But also again, it comes down to a price
conscious idea of what you're buying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a proverbial race to the bottom
folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when pre-rolls become the number one
thing, the cheapest way to make pre-rolls
[SPEAKER_07]: is to take hemp at probably a hundred or
$200 a pound and spray it with THC that's
[SPEAKER_07]: been synthesized because you could
synthesize THC 10 times cheaper than you
[SPEAKER_07]: can growing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, that's just the reality that
we live in is that, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: that stuff that's at the smoke shops and
even in all the bodegas in Manhattan,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, a lot of that stuff is just the
cheapest shit you could possibly find
[SPEAKER_07]: because you know, again, why, you know,
I would just say that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: like if you have, if you have high quality
flour and you're trying to get fair value
[SPEAKER_07]: for that high quality flour, certainly
putting it into pre-rolls is not the way
[SPEAKER_07]: to go, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because just, you know, the overall value
chain and where the grower exists in that
[SPEAKER_07]: value chain is if you look at where the
margins are, everyone is pressured at the
[SPEAKER_07]: front end of that value chain,
including the grower and the processor and
[SPEAKER_07]: the people who really own the distribution
networks and the folks who basically are
[SPEAKER_07]: able to populate dispensary shelves with
product are able to take a little bit more
[SPEAKER_07]: margin because the guys at the other end,
you know, again, look at, go to OLC in
[SPEAKER_07]: Oregon has got a daily tracker on what
usable marijuana is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now, I mean, that number always
floats around somewhere around,
[SPEAKER_07]: it used to be around 1100, 1200,
then it starts sinking around COVID below
[SPEAKER_07]: 800.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's around $600 a pound.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it is really difficult to turn
on the lights at your grow for $600 a
[SPEAKER_07]: pound.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everyone along the way is trying to
extract out as much value as they possibly
[SPEAKER_07]: can.
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, again, we're in that
proverbial race to the bottom where the
[SPEAKER_07]: people who can produce a quality product
at the lowest cost is going to win.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a commodity market, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how we are with everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do food the same way, you know,
there's 30,000 McDonald's, but there's a
[SPEAKER_09]: very few like actually incredible,
amazing restaurants in comparison of any
[SPEAKER_09]: one brand, maybe even just a one or a two.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's done like that with beer and
they have the IPA group.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just have to recognize that we're in
a smaller portion of the market,
[SPEAKER_09]: much smaller, but even if it's,
well, listen, I'm in a super small portion
[SPEAKER_09]: because I'm in like the 1%, I'm a one
percenter.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, like there's all these
other different markets that you can fit
[SPEAKER_09]: into.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm thinking that, you know,
the company that does some of Ryan's
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivars here, and I always mess up their
company name, it's our friend Kip's.
[SPEAKER_09]: A part of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the company name again,
Ryan?
[SPEAKER_09]: Victoria Cannabis Company, Victoria
Cannabis Company.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing exactly that, like taking
dank buds and rolling them into pre-rolled
[SPEAKER_09]: joints.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's a smaller market, but it
doesn't mean they won't do well with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you hear us talking and we sound
like, you know, we're upset and in a
[SPEAKER_09]: negative mindset about this, you know,
all the people who are watching realize
[SPEAKER_09]: that we prefer the much, much,
much smaller percentage of the market that
[SPEAKER_09]: when it's worldwide is actually still a
pretty substantial market.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if a billion people were using
cannabis and you were a part of the 1%,
[SPEAKER_09]: that is still substantial.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is still a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just kind of wanted to add that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got five minutes left.
[SPEAKER_07]: Walmart is a big, is like a big retail.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I think they're the largest
company on planet earth today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think maybe next to Jeff Bezos is
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, if you think about it,
Marcus, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like I'm thinking about like those
customers that walked in to your
[SPEAKER_07]: daughter's dispensary, you know,
at some point, isn't it like, again,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's useful to think about, I guess,
maybe like the micro brew beer model.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like those of us who love petty hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're like the micro brews,
but the majority of the market drinks
[SPEAKER_07]: swill, Budweiser and Bud Light and Miller
Lite.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so yeah, so like Walmart.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me throw something at you here,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: As you know, I'm in Europe here staying
with Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I'm walking the streets
around the neighborhood and I know that
[SPEAKER_13]: you guys have both been here.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's all these little cheese shops and
there's all these little bakeries and
[SPEAKER_13]: these little butchers and fruit shops and
vegetable shops that are selling high end
[SPEAKER_13]: really special cultivars and meat types
and cheese types and vegetable types.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a cultural thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like there there is this cultural thing
where, you know, North America and it's I
[SPEAKER_13]: think it's probably population based,
but there really is this thing where North
[SPEAKER_13]: America has a lot of industrial production
and that kind of stuff just doesn't fly
[SPEAKER_13]: over here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, sure, you have those products,
but it's there's much it's much more
[SPEAKER_13]: normal to have really nice, nice food and,
you know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the cannabis will develop a
lot of those lines here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if the pre-rolls connoisseur
level.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's not the connoisseur level is more
appreciated by the everyday person.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what Brian's saying is is what how
I view New York is like I have a very
[SPEAKER_11]: particular lens on New York.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's because I've lived there for so
long.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I see a culture there that's unlike
anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's much like Europe, where sure,
there's a bunch of crap that's going to be
[SPEAKER_11]: sold and it's the bedegas and they're
going to get their coffee and their
[SPEAKER_11]: pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is a world where they do want
really high end stuff and they're going to
[SPEAKER_11]: want it every day all day.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it does it density.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one it's one a town or a city gets to
a certain size that that a business like
[SPEAKER_13]: that can be supported by the one percent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because very often the one percent isn't
big enough to keep a business like that a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot, especially cannabis regulated
business.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_11]: You bring that up.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're saying so you're saying that
right now there's like there's there's
[SPEAKER_11]: varietals that these shops are selling
like along with.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, for example, if you go to like,
you know, we went grocery shopping the
[SPEAKER_13]: other day and they have all these fruit
varieties are more like they have these
[SPEAKER_13]: blackberries there, you know, the size of
your thumb.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: All these products that are the result of
specialty breeding that that would never
[SPEAKER_13]: make it into the industrial supply chain
in North America.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas where you live in an area where
there's enough people that want a really
[SPEAKER_13]: high end cheese or a really like nice home
bread or like super fine fruits.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us pop tarts and fruit loops.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we want in the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: And wine in a box.
[SPEAKER_07]: And wine in a box.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wine in a box.
[SPEAKER_13]: And diabetes to go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Got diabetes.
[SPEAKER_13]: For anybody watching, if you're if you're
developing those specialty cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: businesses, you know, like Marcus,
you got to just keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Eventually, they'll they'll pay off and
enough people will learn.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if not, you export it to somewhere
they appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep waiting for the world to grow up
and only smoke dry sift like all civilized
[SPEAKER_03]: beans like myself do.
[SPEAKER_03]: One day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, listen, that's it, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Twelve fifty nine.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got one minute left.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's enough time for me to thank you all
for coming and really stoked that you were
[SPEAKER_09]: at San Diego.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam's Ryan.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome to see you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I sort of stalk you on Twitter and had an
idea that you were in the UK.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really sorry to hear about your mom,
but glad you got to visit with with David
[SPEAKER_09]: and Diana.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Wade, for coming out and
sharing, you know, always profound.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've always got the good perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: We sure appreciate you here at Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was nice to have some new folks
with Chris Gassa and Davis Allen.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was really, really sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure we'll get you back.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get you back on here again one day
soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Davis, Dr. Ethan Russo, you're not here
with us anymore, but you were at the start
[SPEAKER_09]: of the show and we appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always nice to see you as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always amazed at how young Dr. Ethan
Russo looks like when you actually figure
[SPEAKER_09]: out his age.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like, dude, that guy's like doing
something right over there for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dr. Mark Sheldon and Colin and
Etienne and Best Friend Farms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Brian, totally appreciate you as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And anyone else that I may be forgetting?
[SPEAKER_09]: All the people that have watched.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had almost 300 people watching for
four hours, which is incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the fact that, you know,
that's the one percent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, it's kind of like it'll grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can get it out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And once we hit the right sort of notes
for people, more people will relate to
[SPEAKER_09]: what it is that we appreciate.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, everybody, for coming on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks to Michael Kraus for that history
lesson.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those bottles.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, Michael, I'd love to have him back
on as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Love listening to him speak.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's just got a sort of hypnotic
voice.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can tell he comes from a place of
passion, as all of you guys do.
[SPEAKER_09]: So may the full melt bless your bowl
sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Johnny B is in Italy in the chat room
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to you, Johnny B in Italy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you're inspiring people on a daily.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure he's going about to do push
ups.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like 101, which means it's 1001.
[SPEAKER_09]: There he's probably doing push ups right
as we speak.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Marcus, take care.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.
