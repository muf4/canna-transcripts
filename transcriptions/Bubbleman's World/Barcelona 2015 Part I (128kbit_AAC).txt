[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and I guess welcome to Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday was an incredible day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I arrived early and man, it was just
non-stop, so much so that I never even
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled my camera out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I took a few pictures and upgraded
Facebook and Instagram a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I went down to HQ
and bumped into David and Edu,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was obviously just the pleasure of
pleasures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great to see those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take the utmost care of me,
gave me some beautiful dry sift hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: many other flavors that I have right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bumped into Matt the Great Gardener and
got my good old friend Barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think that's what we're going
to be opening the day with here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to mess around too much
because once again, I brought a converter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't bring a step down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, I probably only have about five
minutes to run power through this unit,
[SPEAKER_00]: through this whip, to get things heated
and working before it will no longer work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until I meet up with the Dabinator guys
today, he's brought me a specific whip
[SPEAKER_00]: that is 4-2-20 power so it won't blow and
he's brought me a plug for the European
[SPEAKER_00]: plug so I won't need a converter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just sitting here right now pumping a
little prophecy and doing some editing on
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican videos because you guys still
haven't even seen the majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome Jamaican videos that I have
sitting on the hard drive right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, doing that, trying to get ready,
going to head down to Spannivus and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start filming today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the little sessions, all the little
bump-ins, little interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see many, many people from
Javier from Medical Seeds to David from
[SPEAKER_00]: Ripper Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see Jeff Churchin from Seattle and
Todd Rosentak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see Ashwin from the
Amsterdam Seed Center, Matt the Great
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardener and a host of other really great
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get this party started with a
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you, the quality of that
barb, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what I'm saying guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt can't understand the new raws and
craze because well, he grows resin that is
[SPEAKER_00]: 6-star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you grow 6-star resin,
there's pretty much no need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, feel the urge to rosinate your
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I will say this, I saw Cuban took
some of his grade A dry sift and turned it
[SPEAKER_00]: into rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to tell me a little bit more about
that Cuban because that was a brave move,
[SPEAKER_00]: brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brave move.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we're up to temp with the
deep dish banger here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hit a little barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit low, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just come down from my hotel after a
few dabs to the spannibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hook up with Javier from
Medical Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out how the booth's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought I'd stop this giant massive
banner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be so busy for the next
three days that it'll literally be
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible for me to stand here and do any
type of talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd stop right now and do a
little introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the big DNA banner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they are the main sponsors this
year, Don and Aaron, Unity and the
Community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a whack load of others, the
Greenhouse, General Hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: Barneys, PortaLab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's Konstantin, our good
friend from Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we go on in and see what's going
on with the buildup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, so I just rolled up to the
Ripper Seeds booth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's just really setting up,
so it's not really time to do the fair
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to show you guys a little bit
of what David from Ripper Seeds who's just
[SPEAKER_00]: going into the room there has absolute
fire as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
I'll see you guys next time.
