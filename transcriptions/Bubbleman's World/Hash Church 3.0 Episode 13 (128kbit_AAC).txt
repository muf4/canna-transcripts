[SPEAKER_03]: record and then we will go live on YouTube
because you know we deserve it welcome
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade we're gonna go live on YouTube right
now and I believe I believe we're live
[SPEAKER_03]: right now so why don't I say the welcoming
morning welcome as I often do welcome to
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash Church 3.0 episode 13 today starting
it off with uh with Wade and Etienne
[SPEAKER_03]: already in the room how how about that I
believe we are live oh you believe it
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy here let me just share this in the
other chat so we can get our crew because
[SPEAKER_03]: for whatever reason the way Zoom works now
is it doesn't let me go live from the
[SPEAKER_03]: actual video that the the link that I put
up on YouTube it used to do that but now
[SPEAKER_03]: it starts a whole new link so there's 80
people in the other chat room and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like what's going on here all
right there we go let's let that in Mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark we're gonna talk about Mark's
cultivar today early because Mark didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: get to talk last week because Hash Church
you know we're we're aggressive talkers
[SPEAKER_03]: you you gotta you gotta really get in the
get in there if you want to have something
[SPEAKER_03]: to say true that true that welcome Wade
it's nice to see your smiley face feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: really good this morning Marcus right back
at you and Etienne hello sir amazing how
[SPEAKER_03]: you feeling good is noticeable on your
face and is making me feel good oh I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: happy to hear that yeah oh it's the truth
I can't deny it I cannot deny it hey
[SPEAKER_03]: welcome Mark how you doing buddy good
how's it going guys it's going good I like
[SPEAKER_03]: you got your Hash Church hoodie on there
yeah yeah rocking that out this morning
[SPEAKER_03]: thanks for the invite appreciate it yes
yes of course of course I felt bad last
[SPEAKER_03]: week we didn't talk about the Hash Church
we did have a great Hash Church episode
[SPEAKER_03]: though and I think that was the problem
there was just so much to talk about and
[SPEAKER_03]: it was pulling us into the mushroom and
once the mushroom gets a hold of you well
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that's uh that's usually five or
six hours before it lets go so but we got
[SPEAKER_03]: you back today I'm not sure who's going to
come in today it might be kind of a small
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash Church it might be a big Hash Church
last week I sent the link through Facebook
[SPEAKER_03]: but some of the people in that link didn't
receive it Dr. Mark Sheldone said he
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't receive the link which I haven't
figured out how that is because there's
[SPEAKER_03]: two groups I send out emails to certain
groups Wade for instances on the emails
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I do Facebook messenger invites
as well of which most of the rest of you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys probably would have gotten your link
that way welcome Johnny B maybe Johnny B
[SPEAKER_03]: can't hear yet welcome Johnny B
[SPEAKER_16]: Johnny Johnny Johnny can you come out and
play oh is that a Warriors reference yeah
[SPEAKER_16]: I figured isn't it come out to play come
out to play yeah yeah there we go there we
[SPEAKER_03]: go well nice to sit with you guys this
morning I think uh like I said I kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: put it together last minute I would prefer
to just do any old Hash Church just to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep it consistent that's what kind of
everyone's looking for right now in these
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy times that we're living in um and I
just figured you know what even if we got
[SPEAKER_03]: together for a couple of hours and shot
the shit puffed some bowls and talked a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit about the Hash Church cultivar
and some other things uh I figured we'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: good yeah Johnny's trying to configure his
audio by looking at his shelf he's just
[SPEAKER_03]: like what the fuck is going on what the
fuck he'll figure it out it's usually a
[SPEAKER_16]: setting in your zoom though you have to
sometimes it automatically uh switches
[SPEAKER_16]: your audio to your mic if you have an
external mic so you have to switch it to
[SPEAKER_07]: your internal audio I just switched it to
my Yeti so is it working now Lema Charlie
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah yeah Colin's hitting me up saying he
can't find the link and I just sent it to
[SPEAKER_03]: the email so he everyone should have
gotten it on that email that is I thought
[SPEAKER_09]: it was a little bit hard to find uh but
this morning was easy thank you okay good
[SPEAKER_03]: we always want to make it easy we don't
want to make it hard but I'm gonna send it
[SPEAKER_03]: out again just in case I need to go get a
place just in case I have three computers
[SPEAKER_07]: going I don't know which one to hit so
garage living room or the office Johnny B
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear you good okay so now I'm gonna hit
mute so I don't know what the fuck is
going on I don't know what the fuck is
going on I don't know what the fuck is
[SPEAKER_03]: going on okay Johnny B and Colin P. Colin
P. morning Colin never really saw the
[SPEAKER_03]: connection between Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: and Colin P. but now I'll never be able to
unsee it it's just how life is if only
[SPEAKER_03]: Colin had a keyboard just one keyboard
yeah exactly if he had a keyboard he could
[SPEAKER_03]: make it all work but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have none.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what these things do behind
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these days you're going to have to
rip us a tune is what you're going to have
[SPEAKER_03]: to do because I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been watching you in that room for
like, I don't know, three, four or five
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a fake background, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's one of those fake ones.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny because I have two drum kits
here and I've been collecting insurance
[SPEAKER_14]: since I was maybe a teenager when I first
started, you know, moving some stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a good way to put my energy into
other things, so.
[SPEAKER_14]: I.e.
[SPEAKER_14]: launder your cash?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a positive experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hash church, hash church jokes for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, today we're starting by talking
about the hash church cultivar that Mark
[SPEAKER_03]: Hallett, who's in the room right now,
hit me up with a while ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: He first hit me up with that infamous
picture, which I wish I kind of had it on
[SPEAKER_03]: my computer right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just share my screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was kind of the picture that
started it all off for me and how we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get into this conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mark's going to talk and we're going
to have to give him some patience because
[SPEAKER_03]: he's kind of new at these hash church
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what started it all now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plat plant porn.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got some plant porn and that's some
plant porn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, lots of people were like,
oh, you know, is that the hooked trichome
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see, you know, there's I don't see
the heads as clearly as I should.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it, you know, so, you know,
Mark hit me up and he said, listen,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got this cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to name it hash church.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was kind of like a little bit like,
ooh, I was a little bit like a kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit protective of like the hash
church name, you know, I haven't monetized
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told him, like, I'm not going to,
I don't want to be up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to take anything from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to be that greasy guy that
just starts monetizing everything that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: doing with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't really, you know,
feel that it was the thing I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he, he said, look, let me,
let me send you a cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can harvest it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can let me know if you think it's,
it's, it's, it could hold the name hash
[SPEAKER_03]: church.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he sent me the cuts and I managed
to get one to Flav and I completely fucked
[SPEAKER_03]: the rest of it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, for whatever reason,
it was one of the first plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think this has anything to do
with the plant itself because Flav is
[SPEAKER_03]: crushing it, but generally whenever I have
had a small tent, I've been able to throw
[SPEAKER_03]: a couple of plants in there and never have
a problem with this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just gave me a problem for whatever
reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and funny enough, I ended up putting
a Congo just to sort of save face as to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, realize that I'm not talking
shit on the hash church.
[SPEAKER_03]: I threw a Congo into the same tent and the
exact same thing started happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just started looking like it was
nutrient deficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was locking like, and I've been
like, I know how to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feed many, I'm using many one,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, I'm not going to get into a huge
Elysian LED conversation with you right
[SPEAKER_03]: now, but it is, I had an LED light in from
one of the companies and I had an HPS in
[SPEAKER_03]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old tried and true, which I've always
been able to grow great resin with full
[SPEAKER_03]: melt resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, totally fucked that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, Mark being as awesome as he
is, was like, well, maybe I could send you
[SPEAKER_03]: some flour and you could just like make a
batch, like run, run some hash or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh man, I feel like I feel
bad, you know, like I told him,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, if you send me flour, I'm not
smoking any of the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all been sitting in these pizza boxes
since I made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually made it for my course on
camera, but I wanted to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the hash came out completely white.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, complete like super light colored.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did have a melt factor to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like a six star, but it
definitely was melty for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I really loved about it is it
reminded me of an old cultivar I used to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow back like 25 plus years ago called
the Dutch treat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now people may hear that name and think
they had exactly the Dutch treat that I
[SPEAKER_03]: have or had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never really saw it as that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw the Dutch treat many times over
the years, but this particular Dutch treat
[SPEAKER_03]: looked very much like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very coated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had this real sort of unique flavor,
which I also found this particular
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar had a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mark, why don't you tell us a little
bit about how this cultivar came to be the
[SPEAKER_03]: parental stock that was used to create it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And just a little bit about the hash
church.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to mention before Mark starts
is that he's been beyond like,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, look, he's like all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all hurting.
[SPEAKER_03]: This COVID-19 is a real crusher to him and
his family.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took a lot away from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now he's in a position where he's got
this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started posting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were like, where can I get that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can I get that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're hitting them up like you
wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to buy this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to buy that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's told me he's like, listen,
I'm not selling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not giving it away until you give me
the okay that I can use this name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I feel a little bit bad because
it's taken a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I really think of what COVID has
taken away from this guy, maybe I would
[SPEAKER_03]: get off my ass a little bit more and make
it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so today that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about hash church on hash
church.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to let us know a little bit
about the genetics, a little bit about,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, running it, growing it,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll go on from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mark, the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if I'm going to become black,
glitchy or not to you fellows that you
[SPEAKER_10]: guys were a little bit glitchy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as long as I, you guys can hear me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'm good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So pretty much started with years of
watching hash church, to be quite honest,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, ever since this show began.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've kind of tuned in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Dragonfly has just signed up now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those guys have been big inspiration to
me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of started in the hydroponic type
area back in the early nineties.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then once stumbled across hash church
and realized that, you know, organics are
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely the full way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just kind of going down that Dragonfly
route of like a fully regenerative organic
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of a growing style.
[SPEAKER_10]: So from that point, I just want to say a
big shout out to all you guys,
[SPEAKER_10]: every one of you growers on here,
whether you use it or hash makers or not,
[SPEAKER_10]: big inspiration for this cultivar.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think, and I've told this to
Marcus before, I don't think the thing
[SPEAKER_10]: would exist without the show or B-Man
channel.
[SPEAKER_10]: So to give you a quick rundown,
fast story of how this come to be,
[SPEAKER_10]: I was skimming across online and stumbled
across a bubble man's channel.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was advertising his solvent-less
extraction class.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thought, what, you know, to pay a bit
of respect back, I will sign up for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the thing that blew me away,
it was literally like a light switch going
[SPEAKER_10]: off in my head.
[SPEAKER_10]: He does his introduction, a part of this
solvent-less class hosted by Ganja
[SPEAKER_10]: University.
[SPEAKER_10]: He starts off his introduction in his
wakeboard boat, actually, and I sit in the
[SPEAKER_10]: middle of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_10]: And dude, you break down that plant within
the 20 to 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like a light switch literally going
off in my head of how little I really
[SPEAKER_10]: didn't know about the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And from that point, I realized,
yes, I needed, you know, I wanted to
[SPEAKER_10]: create my own kind of hash plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: So at that point, I did my first cross.
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't turn out that great.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just a small little grower in,
you know, a little four by four tent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So very, very limited in what I do inside
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I figured I'm going to go back at it
again.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try it again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_10]: I really wanted a good hasher.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just didn't have access around this area
to anything in quality like you guys
[SPEAKER_10]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's when I crossed the DNAs Kosher
Sorbet with Canuck Cookies.
[SPEAKER_10]: I collected roughly about 190 seeds off
that particular cross.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I figured, oh, I got to give this a
shot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I popped the first seed.
[SPEAKER_10]: As this thing was progressing into flower,
I just noticed the large number of
[SPEAKER_10]: trichomes that were growing on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had enough experience in the past
where I realized that I had something that
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought was a little special as far as
the trichrome production went.
[SPEAKER_10]: So at that point, I just, you know,
kept growing it out, taking as many photos
[SPEAKER_10]: as I could.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the cool thing was it started to
produce this terpene like Marcus had
[SPEAKER_10]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_10]: It reminded me more of a northern light
scum cross I grew back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just was a super, super gassy dank
coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my lights, the photo period would go
off from seven at night to seven in the
[SPEAKER_10]: morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just noticed that the carbon filters
in my indoor tent just were not keeping up
[SPEAKER_10]: to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how gassy and stinky she was.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as it got later in the flower,
the thing that struck me for the hash
[SPEAKER_10]: church name was I was taking an upshot of
family.
[SPEAKER_10]: And to me, it screamed like it looked like
a church window.
[SPEAKER_10]: A stained glass window of a church,
which was super cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thought, fuck well, how cool would it
be to have a strain name hash church?
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought the potential could be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew I needed to make hash at that
point.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I ran a quick batch of hash through and
I pulled the 120.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was telling Marcus, the very first run I
had made of this, I pulled the 120 and it
[SPEAKER_10]: was just jammed full, jammed full.
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't believe how bad this thing
dumped in the 120.
[SPEAKER_10]: My previous runs past that point,
it just seems to have changed into a 90
[SPEAKER_10]: and a 73 now, but just a mysterious part
of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, at that point it reached out
to Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, hey, I think I have something that
you might want to look at.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's got a good potential.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure he probably said, geez,
who's this guy?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why does he want you to name it hash
church?
[SPEAKER_10]: So at that point I said, well,
let's make a little bargain deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll ship you some clones.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys grow them out.
[SPEAKER_10]: At first, I thought that you're going to
flip them a little bit sooner.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I knew Flav had his in quarantine,
which was super cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I respect that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thought, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to show everyone when you're
like, yeah, so I shipped them off a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about this before, but look what
he shipped.
[SPEAKER_03]: The clones off in this is what the clones
showed up in just for everyone to know
[SPEAKER_03]: this guy is top fucking notch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't believe it when these custom
homemade PVC pipes that he's glued a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of tops onto who the fuck has ever
sent you clones in a club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and he also added lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had tiny little lights inserted into
the unit with a little battery pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taked onto the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were, they never were dark at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: The entire time that he shipped them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never received clones in anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: This absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep these forever, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm telling you, this is some tattoo
art that you sent me on the, on the,
[SPEAKER_03]: on the tubing that you sent the clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry to interrupt, but I needed to let
everyone know the level of awesomeness and
[SPEAKER_03]: the caliber that you're, that you're
operating at.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm loving that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew I, yeah, I definitely shit the bed.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first time it was ever very first time
I had shipped clones actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the very first ones I sent to Marcus,
he probably laughed when he opened them up
[SPEAKER_10]: and thought, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, he, I sent him up,
you know, I knew I had to take care of
[SPEAKER_10]: special care of the second batch.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I packed them up and sent them off to
him.
[SPEAKER_10]: But pretty much at that point,
yeah, I wanted to kind of speed the
[SPEAKER_10]: process up for Marcus, at least to get an
idea of what the terpenes were like on
[SPEAKER_10]: this particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I said, dude, you know, what's chance
that I can ship you some flour?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, send me some out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I shipped them out a small little bit
of flour so you could wash just to see.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and, you know, obviously pictures are
one thing and at least he could put a
[SPEAKER_10]: terpene profile to the, to the photo
anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: And at that point, now I just pretty much
continue to run it out and try to get all
[SPEAKER_10]: I can out of her trying to push her as
much as I can.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know Marcus had said, you can't
really wave a magic wand and be a full
[SPEAKER_10]: melt grower right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm definitely a little dragonfly in
training, I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that, that's pretty much the story of
where, where, you know, how it came to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, it mad respect to use all like,
I don't think honestly it would exist
[SPEAKER_10]: without the knowledge drops that you guys
have done in the past.
[SPEAKER_16]: Mark, those designs that you dropped on
there, what, where are they from?
[SPEAKER_16]: And why did you select those on the
packaging?
[SPEAKER_16]: That's pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_16]: All in all, just to send such one,
a nice packaging.
[SPEAKER_16]: But of course you wanted to make an
impression and apparently you very much
[SPEAKER_16]: did.
[SPEAKER_16]: So how'd you go about the art selection
process?
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, that's it was temporary
tattoos.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was quite easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were like an armband tattoo you would
purchase that you would just stick on.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought, you know, I got to go all
out and make a little impression for
[SPEAKER_10]: Marcus that I've, you know, took a little
extra care this time and thought what the
[SPEAKER_10]: heck, why not?
[SPEAKER_14]: How many weeks is the, is the cultivar in
terms of flowering times?
[SPEAKER_14]: And what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to talk to talk a little bit
about what you're vegging, how long you're
[SPEAKER_14]: vegging for and what you think the
cultivar likes and what have you seen so
[SPEAKER_14]: far?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a big fan of yours too, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mad respect to the hash you've been
making too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been checking that out.
[SPEAKER_10]: All you guys, man, it's, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_10]: But veg time has changed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just been pretty much playing around
with this.
[SPEAKER_10]: That the node spacing could be tighter.
[SPEAKER_10]: If flower time sits, which I'm
experimenting with sits about anywhere
[SPEAKER_10]: from I'm guessing 55 to 60 days somewhere
in that neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_10]: The one thing that I did and I think
bubble man maybe seen some photos of as I
[SPEAKER_10]: was harvesting fresh frozen flower once
every about four days.
[SPEAKER_10]: As it was growing late in flower and
trying to run hash that way in mason jars,
[SPEAKER_10]: just to see how it actually acts.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, at what point is,
is it going to smoke the best?
[SPEAKER_10]: So I got a lot of work to do yet,
but just trying to get all I can out of
[SPEAKER_10]: her.
[SPEAKER_16]: How much does she usually yield on a wash
percentage wise?
[SPEAKER_10]: I've even pushed probably closer to
quarter pounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Per plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's in a four by four single plant run
though.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's not, it's not a huge
yielding plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't have a, but I, you know,
I think frost makes up for the yield
[SPEAKER_10]: myself.
[SPEAKER_16]: When you wash or what percentage of rosin
are you left with in the end?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was for the rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was getting back anywhere from 20 to the
highest I got was 22% so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too bad at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, unfortunately, when I washed it was,
I didn't have a scale and I was unable to
[SPEAKER_03]: do the math on the returns.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think from a bubble hash perspective,
it was probably around like 14,
[SPEAKER_03]: 15%.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wasn't actually able to do the
accurate math.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did squish a little rosin and I also
got, I got a little under, I think I got
[SPEAKER_03]: around like 16, 14 to 16.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only, I got to admit, I felt bad having
this guy's flower and I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: like smoke it all and press it all and
wash it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, you know, I'll,
I'll make it and then I'll send it back to
[SPEAKER_03]: him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got 99% of his hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did, someone did just ask me,
Hey, why don't you just take a quick
[SPEAKER_03]: little bowl?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got a little bit right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to dump in the old bowl right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's definitely bubbling and melting
and boiling.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then just another thing quick to
mention is that, you know, hopefully one
[SPEAKER_10]: day all you guys get a chance to grow it
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be super cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was kind of my overall goal was,
you know, eventually if all you guys can
[SPEAKER_10]: have the cut or if at least you just
wanted to try it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: That kind of was my goal eventually would
be super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's reminiscent of that sort of Dutch
treat flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have a really super,
there's not a fruity flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear what you're saying with the gassy
flavor, but even in this dab, it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's more like a musky kind of,
I don't know, just like a Dutch treat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my first high of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, my wake and bake, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very much like right in, right in
here, almost like a headband feeling
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a really nice high.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first hit it, I was like,
Oh, it's, it's the hash church.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to have the most residents got to
knock people out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't get knocked out, but I
realized I don't need it to knock me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got like wedding cake and some other
cultivars that are nice and heavy that I
[SPEAKER_03]: can go to bed with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this one was a really nice sort of,
you know, a lot of my hashes, I've got
[SPEAKER_03]: Congolese in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that lifts me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I hit the heavier ones in the
evening and I hit some of the real tasty
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of upbeat ones in the middle of the
day as to not burn out and fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hash church, funny enough,
I can hit it in any of those categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to hit it at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to hit it in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't hit it much, but I know how bad
I want to hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's generally what decides for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I like something, it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have something on my desk that sits
for a month, then it's not really
[SPEAKER_03]: generally something that I'm, that I'm
excited about, or that I'm feeling good
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hash church definitely is a nice
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, I'm going to get clones back from
Flav so I can actually grow it in my tent,
[SPEAKER_03]: try and get one over to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some over to Johnny B and maybe to the
Dragonfly Earth Medicine folks and any of
[SPEAKER_03]: the other Canadian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome by the way, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome by the way.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have one, one quick question just for
Mark real quick.
[SPEAKER_16]: If, when you water wash it, which micron
had the best glands on it for hash church?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can go back to that very first
wash at 10 that I did the first run.
[SPEAKER_10]: It dumped in the 120 and had a beautiful,
beautiful melt point.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I haven't been able to achieve that
since for some strange reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems to be all in the, you know,
my last few runs have been in the 70 and
[SPEAKER_10]: the 90, 73 and 90.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I saw as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just hit the 73 and it, it really is a
nice vibe hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant looks beautiful under the macro
lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I can actually find, I'm pretty sure
I photographed it and uploaded those
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures unless they're on my camera right
now, in which case, obviously I would not
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to open them up, but let me just
go look real quick and see if I can't find
[SPEAKER_03]: at least a few macro shots of the plant we
love so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I think I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to open it up in Lightroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a second here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys want to have a little chat
with us real quick while I'm checking this
[SPEAKER_03]: out, while I open these hash church
photos, we'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super thankful to hear the story.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see everyone this morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really cool to hear your story,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I just, I love that about
cannabis, you know, it shows itself to the
[SPEAKER_08]: people who, you know, often are really
dedicated, you know, and I can see that
[SPEAKER_08]: you have this dedication inside of you
and, and, you know, I got, let's say the
[SPEAKER_08]: plants rewarding you for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, and I love the idea that
we're all sharing it and learning about it
[SPEAKER_08]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just, it's an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives us something positive to think
about and work with the plant and
[SPEAKER_08]: everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So good to see everyone this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just want to say, you know,
like all of the best strains are already
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really awesome to see a new one come
out and then, and then how it rolls out
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And good job on this morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job on the clone delivery as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to second that emotion.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep chatting guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking for these pictures here and I
can't both chat and- So Mark, you said at
[SPEAKER_08]: first it came out heavy on the 120 and
then now you find it coming out more,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, heavy on the 70 and 90.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any gut feelings or intuition
about that in your experience?
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I'm a little confused by that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually had mentioned that to bubble
man, that the very first run was all on
[SPEAKER_10]: the 120.
[SPEAKER_10]: And for some reason it's just,
you know, I'm getting a big amount in the
[SPEAKER_10]: 90 and the 73 and even the 45.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Melty is sitting in the 90,
the last couple of runs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just trying to find that,
I guess I've started using live worm
[SPEAKER_10]: castings and that was kind of stemmed on,
but you guys as well, I've kind of taken
[SPEAKER_10]: and started composting in indoor using a
live worm casting, worm bent.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe, you know, it's,
it's getting approaching about three years
[SPEAKER_10]: old now and the microbiology and you know,
you can just pop it open and you're seeing
[SPEAKER_10]: all the microbes, all the tiny little
beneficial bugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got some questions for you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just curious on like, temperatures,
DLI, if you know what your daylight
[SPEAKER_07]: integrals are, if you, if you're running
like your VPD, what's your temperatures,
[SPEAKER_07]: humidity levels, like I'm really curious
on the strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause of course I do so many testings on
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm kind of curious on like,
how are you running the strain?
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey Johnny, I'm a big, big fan of YouTube
brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just going to throw this out quick to
Johnny, cause I know you're running LEDs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the two lights that I've been running
with, this particular cultivar where they
[SPEAKER_10]: off the gate and the electric sky 300 S
I've had the most success under that
[SPEAKER_10]: electric sky.
[SPEAKER_10]: Both are, you know, getting huge amount of
frost, but the electric sky seems to
[SPEAKER_10]: excel.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure I'm, you know, I got a total
draw watt for my two electric skies can
[SPEAKER_10]: approach to be about 600 Watts if I fully
crank them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this cultivar likes to sit about the
300 mark, which is, you know, quite,
[SPEAKER_10]: quite low lighting.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it likes a particularly low
lighting compared to my off the gate is,
[SPEAKER_10]: is, you know, crazy and it's, it's bright,
those cobb lights.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it just prefers a little bit of a lower
lighting.
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as VPD, I haven't really messed
with VPD too much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, dude, I, I just haven't really
messed with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of did a little bit, but I found
that that VPD is a little strange as far
[SPEAKER_10]: as how high they, you know, they wanted
the community at certain points.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just seemed like an almost a nightmare
ready to begin as far as PM.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I could see trying to get into,
you know, a little bit better range of
[SPEAKER_10]: that over time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully it's hard to dial into my
basement, the way I'm growing it,
[SPEAKER_10]: just a small four by four tents.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that really changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is really hard to control.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I understand that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you planning on making any seeds of
germplasm of a hash church story at 10?
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't get that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you planning on making any seeds or
germplasm of hash church, the size I know
[SPEAKER_16]: it's available.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll have to explain germplasm.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's new one to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just another word for seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sitting on the F1s.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sitting on about 180.
[SPEAKER_10]: And math says if I've only popped one of
those seeds happen to be the hash church.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've popped, I think four or more just to
run them out door, just to see what they
[SPEAKER_10]: were going to actually be like still
frosty and in terpy, but not quite like
[SPEAKER_10]: that first one.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, you know, math says there's got to
be some other ones in that package.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to make an F1.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to make an F2 cross though,
eventually, but I'm just kind of following
[SPEAKER_10]: bubble man's guidance kind of with this
one of what he recommends, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to offer an opinion.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that I learned early on
in this work is that the health and
[SPEAKER_09]: vitality of the mother plant that you're
taking cuttings from has a lot to do with
[SPEAKER_09]: the vitality of those cuttings.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you try growing them out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if your nursery, your mother plants
are also in that four by four tent or in
[SPEAKER_09]: that same basement, it's likely the
vitality of those mothers might be
[SPEAKER_09]: deteriorating.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why you're seeing a reduction
in the size of your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a thought.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I agree, Wade.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had a tough time actually keeping the
original mother alive.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's looking a lot better than it did
about a month ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm finding it super tough to keep a
mother around for as long as I have now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just trying to keep her as healthy as
possible, like you had mentioned.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I realized that the healthier
the mother is, the better the clones are
[SPEAKER_10]: going to be for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I second what Wade's saying about
propagation.
[SPEAKER_14]: Propagation is the most important part of
your cycle.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't start with the right cuts and
take care of them, you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_14]: really hard time through your growth
cycle.
[SPEAKER_14]: So rejuvenating those moms often is
usually very helpful.
[SPEAKER_14]: And don't give up on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a battle sometimes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, with mothers too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Broad mites and russet mites have been
around for a good amount of time for a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of people.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you'd be unbelievably surprised how
often they still go by without being
[SPEAKER_08]: diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only way to really know whether
you have them is a trained eye or a
[SPEAKER_08]: microscope and looking at the bottom of
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it doesn't have to be a microscope,
like a table microscope.
[SPEAKER_08]: But one that's around 60.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you look at the bottom of the
leaf and at the bottom of the leaf looks
[SPEAKER_08]: like it has trichomes on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the bottom of the sun leaf,
you know that there's not trichomes on the
[SPEAKER_08]: bottom of the sun leaf and that it's broad
mite eggs or russet eggs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And often the plant can look like it's
depleted.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plant can often look like it has a Cal
Mag deficiency or it doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_08]: growth that it's looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: When really it's just being eaten by a
microscope.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people have other microscopic
mites.
[SPEAKER_08]: So and people have all kinds of different
regiments.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, just the simple regimen of
a swarovski and koo-koo maris duo of
[SPEAKER_08]: predator mites, in with your mother,
right, in with your mother and your
[SPEAKER_08]: clones.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, you put it in your closet,
put some of the predators on your closet,
[SPEAKER_08]: on your jackets and everything,
you know, just get predators everywhere
[SPEAKER_08]: eating.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you become a big, official organism
when you go around.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, um, and then as you propagate
and put it into the flower room,
[SPEAKER_08]: you have another route, a fresh round,
you know, on, in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that allows your plant leafs,
the leaves of your plants to be flat.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people in this community need to
understand that flat leaves and praying is
[SPEAKER_08]: health.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's our goal.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's our goal.
[SPEAKER_08]: We, all the trichomes come all of the,
the good smoke, the melt, everything comes
[SPEAKER_08]: after you have a flat, healthy leaf plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a, you know, something for
everyone to just re get to know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, we go to a lot
of different grow rooms and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say that in the indoor grow rooms,
you know, a huge percentage of people have
[SPEAKER_00]: broad mice and people always say,
Hey, you know, I don't see the broad mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you actually see a mite,
then you're way over infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super fast moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're incredibly fast moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the male broad mice disperse the
female eggs throughout the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like you find like a bundle of
eggs or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this because I'm actually seeing
exactly what you're talking about right
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been talking about this because what
happened is I got some clones from a
[SPEAKER_07]: friend, Mark knows and Monte went to the
neighbors who had these mites and they
[SPEAKER_07]: were in his bathroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the week seven, I started getting
him in my flower room.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was, it didn't make a difference to
me because it came in.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that I'm seeing him on my mom's,
I'm like, okay, next step.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm on the bug lady right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I've always sprayed,
I've gone around that thing, but I don't
[SPEAKER_07]: want to spray this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, okay, that's so convinced me
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So right here, bug lady, what do I got to
order?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like Johnny trying to kind of
look, beneficial nematodes are really
[SPEAKER_14]: helpful as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: I found a lot of comfort in using them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It helps me mitose quite a bit in my soils
in the past because it's just all that,
[SPEAKER_14]: all of it together is just a great IPM
system.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's, I love what Josh and Kelly are
saying.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the reasons why I have an
appreciation for tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maristemic tissue culture, just,
just micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still cloning, but you're cloning
like a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny,
[SPEAKER_03]: tiny little fraction of the Maristem and
then growing it up, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing it in this agar medium and a
little, in a little jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it starts growing and all of its fungi
and bacteria and viruses, it, they,
[SPEAKER_03]: they try to keep up, but they can't keep
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you cut that little Maristem,
you get it into their, that, that medium,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really the IP that's going to
convince that plant to grow a dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: shoot and, and start growing upwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you do this for about four to six
months in tissue culture and they call it
[SPEAKER_03]: initiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what it does is it removes all of
those fungized, bacterias and viruses by
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant growing faster and faster and
faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you've got your clone, you're
cutting it up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got your viruses and fungi and
bacteria that are trying to keep up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually you can get them out of
that plant completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And which is what Wade began this
discussion with in regards to,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know, you might have some sort of
thing going on with your mother stock that
[SPEAKER_03]: now the trichome production is down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that thing would be fungi,
bacteria and viruses impregnating your
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and slowing down its ability to
express itself under the perfect
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions that you're trying to,
to, to, to produce for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So had Ian from Segre been here today,
he's with his daughter this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So props to him for being a good dad,
but I really wanted him to be here and he
[SPEAKER_03]: would have been able to say what I just
said much more elegantly and maybe even
[SPEAKER_03]: clearer.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, not only that, not only that,
you know, my other company that I have is
[SPEAKER_16]: bio agronomics group with Rob Clark and
Mojave and our genetics were just cleaned
[SPEAKER_16]: up by Segre.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so on our bio agronomics site,
we have three cultivars that were actually
[SPEAKER_16]: fully biologically cleaned up and it took
some time and it's a quite a process,
[SPEAKER_16]: but I'm quite excited that we're getting
ready to put out a press release regarding
[SPEAKER_16]: our cultivars.
[SPEAKER_16]: So look for that in the coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know all about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't want to say anything,
but amazing that you got to say it and I
[SPEAKER_03]: can't wait for you to release the,
the, the public release.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be awesome to hear about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool that you're involved
with bio agronomics with Mojave and Rob
[SPEAKER_03]: Clark.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty strong trio of people
right there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, very cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a, that's a great group right
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you guys, are you guys working with
any older, older stuff that you can talk
[SPEAKER_14]: about?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anything that's exciting that you
want to tell us about?
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we're just in the midst of
licensing, you know, we're doing what old
[SPEAKER_16]: Driscoll does here in the States,
which license blackberries and
[SPEAKER_16]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're doing that with the older
cultivars and genetics that Rob has
[SPEAKER_16]: collected over the decades, as well as
Mojave since he's, you know, his master
[SPEAKER_16]: botanist.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have a few things that are in the
pipes, but you know, the contracts and all
[SPEAKER_16]: that we're still waiting for.
[SPEAKER_16]: So as those come forward, we'll be more
than happy to make those aware,
[SPEAKER_16]: but you know, contracts.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yes, there's a lot of interest as well
as especially toward the old world
[SPEAKER_16]: genetics, because they're just so missing
on top of that.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we were subjective to such as
Dave's palette, Dave liked the sweeter
[SPEAKER_16]: type of palette.
[SPEAKER_16]: So now we'll have access to the full range
of the older palette for new cultivars to
[SPEAKER_16]: be developed and made from.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what I'm most excited about is
to, to, you know, bring back the old so
[SPEAKER_16]: that we can pull out some of those things
that we miss because we've all been
[SPEAKER_16]: subjective to the palettes of the actual
botanists who have made these plants.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there may be some that I like that you
not like, or there may be some nuances
[SPEAKER_16]: that we're going to find.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, it's going to be an exciting
next couple of years for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just took cuts and re-upped a bunch of
older stuff that I've kept for around 21
[SPEAKER_14]: years to date.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's, it's been a battle for,
to keep these things going.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it's, I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had my stuff for 15, 18 years,
20 years, the Northern light number five,
[SPEAKER_07]: like the, I call Medi Kush is more like a
pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at the land races and the
strains that were around back in the days
[SPEAKER_07]: and just the era and the time that I was
in place of just genetics, I got myself on
[SPEAKER_07]: some of those, those rare ones,
those first OGs, those first Hindu Kushes
[SPEAKER_07]: and Baba Kushes and the lemon ties.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, well, that's all we ran.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all my friends said.
[SPEAKER_07]: We laughable.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, that's all we used to run back in
those days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was all the seeds we were popping.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hearing stories about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're like, we're laughing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, that's the one I called an M4
because it was a, it was the fourth cut of
[SPEAKER_07]: the M of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it came out some name over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, it's pretty cool to start seeing
how people are looking at those old
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics and realizing that that's where
the fire started.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what they need in order to kind
of, there's a lot of, a lot of stuff out
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes really good, but it just doesn't
get you there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like, it's like,
it's nice, but it's like, punch though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all going different places.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of theirs.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be the beauty, beauty of it all
though, too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hidden beauty.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I kind of appreciate the older
varieties that, that are, that are more
[SPEAKER_14]: floral and more Ecuadorial.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a certain entourage effect to
them that I don't get from a lot of the
[SPEAKER_14]: newer stuff that I.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that peanut butter breath that came
to me one time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like, Oh, I have to have it
please.
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone else had this wedding crash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, can you, can I get that cut from
you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like by any chance?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause it's just so tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's the varieties out there with
the breeders and the people just popping
[SPEAKER_07]: and growing for 2021.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like a whole new beginning,
a whole new, whole new generation of,
[SPEAKER_07]: of growers and seeds and varietals coming
out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, it's really nice to see that
2021 is going to be a growing year for
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody and looking forward to all these
new strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's try and find those genetics that
they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause some of these names I hear them
like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on seed finder.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, like give me, tell me what these
strains are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are they coming from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what are their parents?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and it's, it's like, they just,
you can't call a dish.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to call something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then now you don't know what it is.
So.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just saying, I think that it's more
important than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know I had said this one time
before on hash churches to pop those 2021
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds because of all the intention that
went into the 2020, you know, breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time, you know, we're all in this crazy
lockdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much energy going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all dealing with really heightened
emotions or heartstrings and all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: energy has been going into our gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have this great opportunity to
pop these 21 seeds that see what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: answers that the plant can give us as a,
as a collective consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it that, you know, John,
you're, you're really bringing up the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy of popping those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So encouraging everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share your seeds, pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's, let's really let cannabis,
you know, do what she's meant to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really healing, heal the planet.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's why I was asking Mark about
seeds earlier, but you know, it's
[SPEAKER_16]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_16]: I got selected to be a judge for the
Emerald Cuff and it's happening in the
[SPEAKER_16]: spring this year.
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, it's not a gathering,
but we're going to be doing the,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the sampling and judging part
this year.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're actually being doing it by terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not doing it by names.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's going to be very interesting to
see because we've always had, I've always
[SPEAKER_16]: had the issue of names or suggestions or
terroirs, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_16]: So now we're going to be issued them by
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's going to be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_16]: SC labs is actually doing all the testing
again.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're, they're still receiving
currently for the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can go to the Emerald Cup online.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you are domestic, they're also
having a traditional market cup as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not just the legal market cup,
we're having a traditional market cup.
[SPEAKER_16]: So those that are in the underground
markets can actually try to compete
[SPEAKER_16]: against those that are in the legal
market.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's going to be very interesting to
see how everything's broken out,
[SPEAKER_16]: but I think we're going to be judging in
March officially.
[SPEAKER_16]: Or the ceremony is going to be,
but a shout out to Emerald Cup and Tim
[SPEAKER_16]: Blake and the crew for still keeping it
going after COVID.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we weren't able to meet this past
December because otherwise I would have
[SPEAKER_16]: seen dragonfly and you all have beautiful
smiling faces and a hug y'all and smoked
[SPEAKER_16]: out, but unfortunately it's just not that
way and not going to be that way.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully next year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big up to Hazel Bagwell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hazel, we love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the work that everybody's doing out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we want to let you guys know that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to jump in for a second and just
say it's actually in my mind, pretty good
[SPEAKER_09]: news that the judging is happening in the
spring because the things you're sampling
[SPEAKER_09]: have actually had a chance to cure
properly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have talked to Tim Blake about that the
second or third time that he did the
[SPEAKER_09]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, look, man, I owned that
weekend in December.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't change it just because the taste
will be better, but much respect and enjoy
[SPEAKER_09]: the judging process.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know you wanted to say something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I got one other thing I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were talking about all of the beautiful
old cultivars that are coming to hand
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_09]: John, thank you for doing that work.
[SPEAKER_09]: And others, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to add in not just terpenes,
like everybody's talking about all the
[SPEAKER_09]: different experiences that primarily type
one cannabis THC gives you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm really a big fan as you probably
know of type two cannabis where you've got
[SPEAKER_09]: THC and CBD and other cannabinoids
together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's part of the minor
cannabinoids and CBD in relation to THC is
[SPEAKER_09]: where I think the feel good part of
cannabis usage comes in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Type one high THC is really about
psychoactivity and and it's can get
[SPEAKER_09]: literally psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were talking about mushrooms last week
and I was thinking about people whose
[SPEAKER_09]: first experience with cannabis was a
really fat edible that some friend gave
[SPEAKER_09]: them that because they said they wanted to
try cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they got a hundred and fifty milligram
dose of THC the very first time they ever
[SPEAKER_09]: tried it and got obliterated.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've had that experience myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis can be not just about getting
high, but it can also be about feeling
[SPEAKER_09]: good.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's one of the things that
I'm personally very excited about.
[SPEAKER_09]: It works in my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes me feel happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like being happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: People like all your stone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, so I like being happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I use cannabis because I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm addicted to being happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm addicted to feeling good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And cannabis makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what's wrong with feeling?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the best thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like we feel good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that makes you feel good,
then that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and someone's mentioned something on
my Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're just the junkie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, people like like so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people are just like ragging on the
sky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I use cannabis because it makes me
feel good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is the best part about being who
we what we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: We use it because it makes us feel good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It inspires our mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes us do better things for ourselves
or for others.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, most people smoke a joint,
want to help people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey, can I help you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I do something for you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, look at this cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that the walls are down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things are changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are growing and enough of what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's grow forward for twenty twenty
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's the whole idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some major obstacles for
Californians this year with the fire
[SPEAKER_08]: development and the widening of roads.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people in California that
are feeling like their whole entire
[SPEAKER_08]: growing season is under threat with new
farm, not their season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their whole farm is under threat for them
to be able to receive a new license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they don't widen the roads to where
there's a truck turnaround that every fire
[SPEAKER_00]: truck can make a turnaround that they're
not going to allow any licensing of any
[SPEAKER_00]: type of businesses up those roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a tremendous amount of California
licensed farms are under threat right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the farms and a lot of people
who are very politically involved feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's a definite attack against the
small cannabis farmer rather than just a
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea for wildfires in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of other ways that things
could happen other than the farmers are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for widening the roads or
basically put everybody out of business.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Spring Creek Farm for
bringing that to our peer certified
[SPEAKER_08]: attention, our group and stuff happening
in Maine as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maine is starting to squeeze down on the
caregiver market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's getting pretty dicey.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if any of you activists out there,
anyone that is involved in the community,
[SPEAKER_14]: please comment, please talk about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Please be vocal.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll really help us all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, we got to keep compassionate
care.
[SPEAKER_08]: The focus of the legalization and
everything and compassionate care is what
[SPEAKER_08]: gave us the ability.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gave us this evolution.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so to turn our back on compassionate
care for the sake of corporate business
[SPEAKER_08]: and the sake of profits, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when Johnny says, oh, I'm addicted to
feeling good and that's why I smoke
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis, we're addicted to helping the
earth while we create cannabis to feel
[SPEAKER_08]: good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're creating all these systems to
say, hey, the earth is also ailing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm not going to take a compound or
a plant like cannabis, grow it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to grow it degeneratively so
that I can regenerate humanity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, I always want to encourage people
to recognize that all of the actions that
[SPEAKER_08]: you do are part of the health and
wellbeing that we're going, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: that we're moving towards.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're working really, really hard on
making our medicine available in Canada
[SPEAKER_08]: and creating a new website for
compassionate care to make it available to
[SPEAKER_08]: patients for medical patients in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is going to be a really big new
step for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're really excited about it and it's
not finished yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can't share exact details on it,
but I think it's for the betterment of all
[SPEAKER_08]: people on earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope it's all going to be great for
Canadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's called plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to remind everybody it's plant
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of those plants out there are
speaking to us as humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this long, incredible,
in-depth history.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these plant medicines.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to jump in about this thing you
mentioned happening in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it sounds like in Maine as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: The specifics of it is the board of
forestry is considering the new updating
[SPEAKER_09]: of the fire regulations and where it
applies to, where it affects cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_09]: It also affects everyone who lives in
rural areas in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the way it's going to play out is
if you want a permit to do anything like
[SPEAKER_09]: repair the deck on your house or build a
house or have a cannabis commercial
[SPEAKER_09]: activity on your property, you have to
have a road that allows a fire truck to
[SPEAKER_09]: come in and a car to come out at the same
time, which is 20 feet wide plus a couple
[SPEAKER_09]: of feet wide on each side.
[SPEAKER_09]: And every so often you have to have
turnouts and it's basically appropriate if
[SPEAKER_09]: you wanted to put a Walmart or a gas
station or a shopping center on your farm.
[SPEAKER_09]: You would need a road like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to require that for any kind of
permit, especially a cannabis permit means
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot of the heritage farms in California
are being faced with the environmental
[SPEAKER_09]: impacts of putting in a commercial scale
road to their farm in order to get a
[SPEAKER_09]: permit to have cannabis license.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really the whole idea of legislation
or legalization as it's called,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's really commercialization.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the whole idea of legalization was to
give heritage free market farmers a
[SPEAKER_09]: chance, a way to come into compliance with
the law.
[SPEAKER_09]: This effort through the board of forestry
is a thinly disguised effort to shut that
[SPEAKER_09]: effort down and perpetuate, in my opinion,
prohibition and the whole war on drugs
[SPEAKER_09]: thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: One last little remnant of the only a few
more days left president, if you will,
[SPEAKER_09]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_16]: People have to understand that most once
you get into Northern California,
[SPEAKER_16]: once you get off the main roads,
it's all dirt roads.
[SPEAKER_16]: You get up into Sonoma, you get into
Mendocino, you get into Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the reality.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, one farm I went to was literally
45 minutes off the county road.
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, so it is onerous and very frustrating
because I was a previously a legacy
[SPEAKER_16]: traditional market grower up in Mendocino
myself.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we had a farm and we had legal numbers,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the next year they change it from
99 plants to 25.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's unfortunately been a frustration
because then we lost our farm because we
[SPEAKER_16]: couldn't afford to keep it open because
the numbers just didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_16]: In the end, for what we were trying to do,
whereas 99 plants, it made it OK to do,
[SPEAKER_16]: but very challenging given the terroir and
what we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's definitely a frustration.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so this is a direct threat to the
traditional market.
[SPEAKER_16]: And some people that I know in the
traditional market, because I know
[SPEAKER_16]: somebody who purchased our farm in
Mendocino County, and now they're a legal
[SPEAKER_16]: market.
[SPEAKER_16]: But these types of restrictions will run
them out of business because how far off
[SPEAKER_16]: they are in the road and the cost will get
it to get there, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's illogical.
[SPEAKER_16]: And on top of that, it's just a
frustration all in all.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm sorry to hear that that's also
happening in Maine and other states,
[SPEAKER_16]: but this is where pushback needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: We are having challenges.
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is why you need to show up at your
water board meetings, your forestry
[SPEAKER_16]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_16]: People say, oh, I don't want to get
involved in politics.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, all this is politics around you.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's affecting everything from your rows
to your sewage to your access and your
[SPEAKER_16]: access points.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we really have to always think
globally, but act locally completely.
[SPEAKER_16]: So plug in, be at the table.
[SPEAKER_16]: Otherwise, you're on the menu.
[SPEAKER_16]: And nobody wants to be on the menu.
[SPEAKER_16]: So show up and be at the table.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the price of liberty,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you want to continue what we did
not pass sitting back and hiding in our
[SPEAKER_16]: shelters, growing our cannabis quietly no
longer works for us.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to actually plug in and speak up.
[SPEAKER_16]: On top of that, we have to figure out a
way in California to raise up the
[SPEAKER_16]: traditional market.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been able to do it with the
over-regulated market, but we need to
[SPEAKER_16]: figure out how to make the traditional
market safer for consumers because
[SPEAKER_16]: consumers have chosen that.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we know the unscrupulous cannabis that
does not make the grade in the legal
[SPEAKER_16]: market goes to the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm always fascinated from traditional
marketists on the frustrations that I hear
[SPEAKER_16]: from them, which is the over-saltification
of their plants that they get.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the cannabis is no longer the craft
quality they used to get prior.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of a commercial quality that
people are utilizing to make money.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we've got this unfortunate continuation
of the prohibition that has led to back in
[SPEAKER_16]: the day.
[SPEAKER_16]: You remember we used to import all that
stuff from Canada in those bags,
[SPEAKER_16]: et cetera, that extra wet weed that we
would get back in the day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beasters.
[SPEAKER_16]: Beasters.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beasters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just defend Canada for half a
second because it didn't start like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met quite a few buyers over the years
that would tumble the flowers before they
[SPEAKER_03]: brought it down to sell it to their
American brethren.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would tumble the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm talking hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pulling like so much resin off
that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the poor Canadian growers were
getting like burned for like oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys are growing the schwag up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it no trikes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, well, you should talk to
your brother who's selling it to you
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's not cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also an issue of hydroponic growing,
taking off, you know, and the whole
[SPEAKER_08]: warehouse grown hydroponic blast,
blast off mode that happened in British
[SPEAKER_08]: Columbia.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then of course makes that with the
syndicates that bring things back and
[SPEAKER_08]: forth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you just have those remnants around
still today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about commercial weed not
being very good, well, we can talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the same light as beasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really sort of the first time that
North America had seen such volume of that
[SPEAKER_00]: salted commercial weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was definitely coming from,
you know, a particular variety of people
[SPEAKER_00]: up here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even that didn't start like that,
you know, because I remember how that
[SPEAKER_03]: started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Breeder Steve was really one of the
people who he gave that cut to key people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were just like, oh, wow,
like we can do this instead of this other
[SPEAKER_03]: very dangerous thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember back in the day,
like when those guys first started doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it, it was actually it was grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was unbelievable that people that
never grew before were growing like this
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful grapefruit flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem was within about two to three
years, they were just like, we get the
[SPEAKER_03]: same money.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't even have to dry it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't even have to finish it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like five weeks, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sort of turned into this sort of
thing where it was like, that was a big
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the beasters name as well,
100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember when it first started,
I was blown away at the quality that they
[SPEAKER_03]: were able to produce very early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It surprised me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people go in the other direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Kootenays of British Columbia are one
of the homelands of cannabis in all of
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's there's one of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Vancouver and there's the islands
and there's certain areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Kootenay is a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be honest, because I first went to
the Kootenays almost 30 years ago and they
[SPEAKER_03]: were growing and digging holes on the
mountain and mixing soils and had a deep
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge of organics and sustainability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm telling you, like some of the
flower that I saw there in particular,
[SPEAKER_03]: one that I would love to find if anyone
ever knew the the the background of this
[SPEAKER_03]: lineage, it was called the A1 Magenta.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one of the most beautiful
Kootenay grown flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turned ever so purple, but very,
very light purple, not that purple that
[SPEAKER_03]: you look at and go, that's probably not
going to be very strong or tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this really nice light, light,
almost like a light pink would come over
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just such a beautiful,
beautiful high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would compare it high wise to Kaya's
coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sort of very uplifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like this is beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was that was probably in 1990 or
91 that I went there and dug holes and
[SPEAKER_03]: planted those plants and helped my my
friends from the Kootenays grow one of
[SPEAKER_03]: their.
[SPEAKER_08]: We first came to we first came to the
Kootenays in 98 and our mind, our brain
[SPEAKER_08]: exploded.
[SPEAKER_08]: We came from Oregon and northern
California.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was so militant and so hardcore and
harsh and had this like super edge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm from there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I know the edge.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's it's fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a beautiful thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you come up to the Kootenays,
oh, my God, especially back then,
[SPEAKER_08]: this place is serious.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we were smoking weed like in town
in a store in 1998, smoking hash oil off a
[SPEAKER_08]: coal, you know, off the mayor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, we were smoking hash oil in 98.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, dude, those guys,
who do you think I was talking about?
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, and these families are are,
you know, what I love about this region
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's kind of a potent for this time of
politics and everything is the
[SPEAKER_08]: conscientious objectors that live in this
area.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important for people to know the term
conscientious.
Objector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were the ones that came from,
you know, decided that they didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the Vietnam War.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a tremendous amount of them came up to
the Kootenays to grow ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were the ones when we first came
here in 98, it was all the 50 year olds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, now our age people that were
giving us all these seeds that they had
[SPEAKER_00]: been breeding for 15 and 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just sort of set us out like,
here you go, kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some good pointers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm 10 years to 88 when I was sitting
on the back of the steps as a police
[SPEAKER_07]: station and carrying me as smoking a
joint, hanging out with the guys that were
[SPEAKER_07]: growing all through there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where, that's where my best
friend's dad lived.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where they were growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where some of the seeds that I
started getting back in those days,
[SPEAKER_07]: 89, 90, 91.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have seen, we have a lot of,
oh yeah, common commons right there,
[SPEAKER_07]: just because you guys are like 10 years
later, but we know the same type of that
[SPEAKER_07]: whole thing going all the way up into
Ashcroft and to Vernon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of fire came out of there in those
days.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of genetics back then created a lot
of the companies out there today that
[SPEAKER_07]: people don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of hardcore images back in
those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the buyers again, you know,
I, you know, Marcus just mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the buyers that were, you know,
sifting out flour or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also the buyers that started to
tell us way back in the day that they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want it to smell, that they wanted
it to look some certain way that they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want it potent and, you know,
not potency as far as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: potency of feeling, but, you know,
the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just like a real family vibe
that turned into sort of like a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: buyer thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what really made those awesome,
amazing old school varietals up here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada turn into the Beasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and that's how we got that,
that reputation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before the Beasters started was when we
got here and we got 98.
[SPEAKER_08]: So by 99, we start, we got given a soil
recipe by a local ganja grower here who
[SPEAKER_08]: had just come from Victoria and lived over
and worked in a food production,
[SPEAKER_08]: a greenhouse on the, on the island.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he came back and the soil recipe was
very similar to the living soil no-till
[SPEAKER_08]: recipes of today, which was pyroclastic
clay.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, three third of compost,
third peat moss was big here, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: there was no cocoa at that time.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the oyster shells, the glacial
rock dust, the, there was key components,
[SPEAKER_08]: the clay, but anyway, it was very similar,
almost, almost identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like what we were mixing in like
90 and 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those guys have known for so long.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been making these soils,
you know, since then, since then.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and it's cool to everyone's,
oh, they've changed so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think the way they've changed is
we add more actual raw materials and haze
[SPEAKER_08]: and living cover crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that part's changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we didn't put living seeds and,
and living things on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was definitely hybridized nowadays,
but the base soil has, is damn near
[SPEAKER_08]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think those originally, those soil
recipes came from Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, those, those old organic soil,
a lot of them, you know, Cornell
[SPEAKER_08]: University is a, is a, is a homeland for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just also like- And before we were
doing soils, we were down in Oregon and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were just digging holes and trying to put
as much stuff as we possibly could put in
[SPEAKER_00]: the holes, make the holes as big as you
possibly could, because that's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: thought was the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the early nineties, we were growing
huge humongous plants in sort of virgin
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really awesome and amazing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learning about soil recipes off of that
and like, oh, wow, I guess that's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing when we were mixing them in
these big holes and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: even putting like some of the dead animals
in the bottom of the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you find a dead frog on the road,
put him in the bottom of the hole or dead
[SPEAKER_00]: snake or something, put them in the bottom
of the hole.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rule of thumb as we were growing up
was to, like she said, put, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: a fish or some kind of actual living dead
animal in the hole.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then to have fish, like when I was in
high school, so this is like eighties or
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, you know, my, I have close friends
that were rotting fish in water and,
[SPEAKER_08]: and it was the, the, the, the,
the goal was to make it the most
[SPEAKER_08]: disgusting smelling liquid you could
possibly make because that's how you make
[SPEAKER_08]: stinky weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, you know, you get the,
the purple Kush was very common back in
[SPEAKER_08]: the late eighties in Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was probably the most potent good
purple Kush that you could ever get.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would just remember to absolutely
amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Flavors on those, on those herbs back then
in Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to, just to mention how prolific,
and I'm sure it's as prolific now,
[SPEAKER_03]: but how prolific it was just even in the
early, early nineties growing cannabis in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Kootenays while we were out there
digging these holes and planting these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, you know, it's, it's, the
Kootenays, a lot of it is around Kootenay
[SPEAKER_03]: Lake and it's like this one road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a very kind of in and out sort
of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they would set up roadblocks and
they would actually be looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: gardening equipment, shovels, pots,
mud, like, and the first time I ever went
[SPEAKER_03]: through one, I just couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, are you kidding me that the
police are doing roadblocks just to see if
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys have like shovels and pots and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they just like, write your
license plate that he's like, Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like all everyone here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, and they just,
they're going for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, Oh, just throw a tarp over
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, what if they asked to
lift the top?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, whatever, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just loved the attitude back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a wild, wild West.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're smoking weed in town, you know,
but then now all of a sudden there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: roadblock on the way home.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, what, what are we missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We always used to have, you know,
some wild crafted stuff in the car and
[SPEAKER_00]: just say that we were wild crafting all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was just always the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always make sure you've got some kind of
nettle or something in the car that would
[SPEAKER_00]: say that you're out wild crafting for your
garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: And most, most people didn't get in
trouble back then.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know at least a good amount of
people that when, when they did get in
[SPEAKER_08]: trouble there, you know, they could have
in the past retrieved the goods taken from
[SPEAKER_08]: them out of the dumpster, out of the back
of the cop shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard the same thing to be honest,
but it's that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like they were arresting tons of
people, but they would go and take your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for, and for the Kootenays,
that was like pretty devastating to have
[SPEAKER_03]: your crop taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like to me, like all my friends
in the Kootenays were not driving Ferraris
[SPEAKER_03]: and living in mansions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all had like nice little homesteads
and they were all like working really hard
[SPEAKER_03]: to get this crop out so that they could
kind of have this money to invest into
[SPEAKER_03]: everything they needed for the next year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like our, our patch was a seven
and a half hour hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like, you know, a really big
hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd have to leave, you know,
at dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we wanted to get home, you know,
having, you know, some kind of a farm home
[SPEAKER_00]: life with the animals and stuff at home,
we'd have to leave at dark and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, come back at dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super intense and really amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Josh, Kelly, did you guys ever look at
Korean natural farming early on?
[SPEAKER_14]: It was one of my first forays into just
getting out of salts and looking deeper
[SPEAKER_14]: into the land.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys, it was just really inspiring
because at the time there was just nothing
[SPEAKER_14]: that I could read at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: There just was nothing.
[SPEAKER_14]: But then there was this and there was
books.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I, so I really honed in on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was, I'm curious to see if you guys
maybe did something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we first came, when we first
started growing cannabis, we learned about
[SPEAKER_00]: what was called weed teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you put a garbage can in
your garden, in your vegetable garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you take all of your weeds and you
throw all of your weeds into basically as
[SPEAKER_00]: a liquid composter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're throwing them into water and
your liquid composting your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then we started doing research on
like all of the different cultures that do
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Japanese did liquid composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the Europeans did liquid
composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of those weed tea rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some of those fruit and vegetable
composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started doing some of the
different recipes even from some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Quakers that live in our community up in
this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would be, then say, Hey,
you know, if you do nettle and you do some
[SPEAKER_00]: chickweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really started out our growing,
doing sort of this liquid herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: decoction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mixed with raw materials going to like a
hybrid thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically what she's saying is in 99 we
got here and we were following natural
[SPEAKER_08]: farming concepts without knowing the word
natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah we had already been doing liquid,
liquid composting and using herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: decoctions and a lot of the tea recipes
that we do today came from that not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily from KNF and then later we
went to Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_08]: In 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2008 and a master Cho was doing a
workshop the very first workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the big island.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the big island in Hawaii at that time
and he was talking about oh all these KNF
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas and we're like whoa that's sort of
what we're already doing that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing and and then we sort of finited
some of our skills with the LAB adding LAB
[SPEAKER_00]: to it so we took some some little
treasures and little gems from a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the old world farming practices and we
took some of those gems from KNF as well
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we're not fully entrenched in KNF
because we really want to do what's
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest for us what works on our farm what
works for what we have growing what type
[SPEAKER_00]: of biomass that we have growing and we're
really specific on what we bring in we
[SPEAKER_00]: really don't bring in anything we bring in
a c90 which is a 90 trace mineral onto our
[SPEAKER_00]: farm other than that we're 100 percent
closed loop so a lot of the KNF recipes
[SPEAKER_00]: ask to bring in things that just wasn't
conducive for us is all so we just
[SPEAKER_00]: continued on with a lot of the old school
recipes that we had been doing since the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of our growing practices and
then again finited it with KNF in 2008 so
[SPEAKER_14]: like a hybrid if you will of all these
different ideologies and and you really
[SPEAKER_14]: borrowed from the things that you felt
were important yeah I think great that's
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah because we we walked out seven and a
half hours so we really couldn't carry
[SPEAKER_00]: anything with us at all so we have to
really look at what type of herbs were out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that were good for different types
of nutrients and different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals so with all of my herbology
background I know what has high magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: what has high cobalt what has you know
high calcium so we just started you know
[SPEAKER_00]: doing tea ferments with those type of
herbs in treating plants for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: maladies and nutrients that they needed at
the time I would just add I would just add
[SPEAKER_08]: one more thing really quick which is so
all through the 90s we're studying
[SPEAKER_08]: midwifery right we're studying plant teas
and naturopathic medicine for women right
[SPEAKER_08]: we've already said this plenty of times uh
and locally but then we move up to you
[SPEAKER_08]: know this far away place we're not
citizens we have to survive out in the
[SPEAKER_08]: mountains we have to be underground no one
can know we live here you know so we chose
[SPEAKER_08]: to mean take that as like oh okay we're
not going to the grow store so now we're
[SPEAKER_08]: we're living on the land we're going to be
self-sufficient homestead we moved to one
[SPEAKER_08]: of the most you know powerful places
probably in all of British Columbia to do
[SPEAKER_08]: that to be real and we have this
incredible route so now we're like okay
[SPEAKER_08]: we're going to grow gardens in this
herbology midwifery style oh we're going
[SPEAKER_08]: to do stuff like biodynamics I mean good
god since you know forever you know uh uh
[SPEAKER_08]: Rudolf Steiner has millions millions of
pages on on spiritual sacred cultivation
[SPEAKER_08]: our library in our community is filled
with books of biodynamics homesteading you
[SPEAKER_08]: know uh stuff from Europe stuff from Asia
and so we're we're we're engulfed in this
[SPEAKER_08]: there's no internet there's no way of
communication there's so that that's part
[SPEAKER_08]: of our inoculation let's say so then we
get into this you know growing on the
[SPEAKER_08]: hillside and then we and then we find this
revelation you know of Korean natural
[SPEAKER_08]: farming you know and then we put all the
parts together and then we find oh Hugo
[SPEAKER_08]: culture you know and and so one of our
biggest things is unleash your dogma
[SPEAKER_08]: because when you become a knf person you
think that you are in the dogma of life
[SPEAKER_08]: like korean national farming has to be
this way or it's not actually korean
[SPEAKER_08]: natural farming you know or or maybe even
biodynamics you know you can't be a
[SPEAKER_08]: demeter certified farm unless you use
biodynamic preps you know i mean which is
[SPEAKER_00]: all you can do all sorts of other things
which don't make any sense so i think what
[SPEAKER_00]: josh means by unleashing your dogma is
just do what works for your farm you know
[SPEAKER_00]: accept other people's means and ways if
there's you know natural processes that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using it's awesome we say that you
need closed loops with the dem
[SPEAKER_00]: certification well we hear about new
closed loops every day it's so awesome the
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible creativity that people come up
with to create natural closed loops by
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing all these different modalities
of ancient growing practices and now every
[SPEAKER_08]: year all the time it's just constantly
validated give thanks we love family
[SPEAKER_09]: question uh for dragonfly uh if if you
were going to summarize what you're doing
[SPEAKER_09]: or people who are listening what they
could do to optimize their soil health
[SPEAKER_09]: wouldn't you say that like really what
we're what we're trying to do is capture
[SPEAKER_09]: the biology that's already happening on
your soil in your land around you and
[SPEAKER_09]: taking advantage of the inputs that are
already there and just recognizing them
[SPEAKER_09]: for what they are and building again not
so much things like worm castings or any
[SPEAKER_09]: specific teas but it's more about the
biology the microbiology the microbiome if
[SPEAKER_09]: you will of fungus and bacteria and
viruses all of the various things that are
[SPEAKER_09]: happening that's really what we're trying
to enhance if you will with closed loop
[SPEAKER_09]: systems would and as my teacher on this
kind of thing i'd love to hear your
[SPEAKER_08]: thoughts on one of the number one reasons
to do closed loop was if it's not coming
[SPEAKER_08]: from your farm where's it coming from how
did it get there and what what was it made
[SPEAKER_08]: from you know so that that was a thing
that said if and maybe you live on a farm
[SPEAKER_08]: that doesn't have everything that you need
on it you know so there's might maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: reasons that's why you want to grow
different plants and also for the success
[SPEAKER_00]: of the farmer so just to add real quickly
when you bring on things we were noticing
[SPEAKER_00]: some omri listed things were were not uh
were failing tests for farmers so we
[SPEAKER_08]: really wanted the ultimate success for
farmers go ahead and um yeah just the idea
[SPEAKER_08]: that it puts you in a more self-reliant
more powerful place like again we have to
[SPEAKER_08]: look at to where we are in life right now
are we reliant on the system to be healthy
[SPEAKER_08]: are we reliant on the system to create
health and well-being in our soil well we
[SPEAKER_08]: think it's more powerful not to well and i
think you know we think it's more powerful
[SPEAKER_08]: to get your power from nature which has
survived mass extinction in the past you
[SPEAKER_08]: know so we're trying to ally with that
that survives you know and and
[SPEAKER_08]: microbiology is what survives science is
as a falling in the in the in the in the
[SPEAKER_08]: evolution of nature you know so very
helpful with the evolution of nature but
[SPEAKER_00]: we're always proving something different
with science it's ever changing you know
[SPEAKER_00]: end line you know where is the end line
and science is always changing the end
[SPEAKER_00]: line but nature never really seems to
change her end line her goal number one
[SPEAKER_00]: goal is to make soil so if we want to
mimic nature and what her closed loops are
[SPEAKER_00]: then all of our number one goal is to make
soil so if we want to you know continue on
[SPEAKER_00]: the path of what nature has shown us in
her health and well-being and being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to overcome such incredible amounts of
opposition with what she's been thrown out
[SPEAKER_00]: by humanity and toxicity then we can
recognize that nature is able to detoxify
[SPEAKER_00]: almost everything so why not utilize her
as as the main mentor basically and
[SPEAKER_08]: enhance the the ability of your plant to
evolve you know i mean we're trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: give it more more microbiology so that it
can enhance its own medicine so we feel
[SPEAKER_08]: like that's done through local raw
materials i came to the practices you guys
[SPEAKER_09]: recommend through trying to make the
cleanest possible version of cannabis so
[SPEAKER_09]: that we could make medicine and that was
really what it was all about for me and
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah i remember hearing about i guess
somebody was at the that same event on the
[SPEAKER_09]: big island when and a friend came back
talking to me about knf when i was still
[SPEAKER_09]: working indoors and it was an exciting
concept but i couldn't see how to make any
[SPEAKER_09]: of that work inside a warehouse in san
francisco so not to be confused with kfc
[SPEAKER_09]: for sure had one of those just down the
street from the warehouse also we there
[SPEAKER_08]: it's also important to note that natural
farming is not just from korea so like
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a whole natural farming modality
from japan you know and all of the asian
[SPEAKER_08]: countries and again all of the asian
countries but em which is effective
[SPEAKER_08]: microorganisms has been you know has
lactic acid bacteria untreated or purple
[SPEAKER_08]: non-sulfur bacteria pnsb and yeast so em
is the yeast the purple non-sulfur
[SPEAKER_08]: bacteria and lactic acid bacteria and you
can do a million things that's where you
[SPEAKER_08]: learn how to make bokashi so you know
bokashi is locking in lactic acid bacteria
[SPEAKER_08]: and yeast and those most vigorous
fermenting microbes and locking it into
[SPEAKER_08]: bran right but most of the bokashi
originally the people would cheap out and
[SPEAKER_08]: the bran would not be organic because
they'd be like oh the microorganisms are
[SPEAKER_08]: going to change over the toxicity of the
plant no and then also it would be like oh
[SPEAKER_08]: well we're gonna we're gonna activate em
or we're gonna activate bokashi with
[SPEAKER_08]: non-organic molasses and then you're just
like well that's a horrible thing right
[SPEAKER_08]: there because you know sugar in itself
when produced you know is a terrible thing
[SPEAKER_08]: so you have to be careful so the you know
anyway there's incredible manuals of
[SPEAKER_08]: farming modalities from the philippines
from india from thailand from miyanmar
[SPEAKER_08]: pakistan all using just em technology so
it's dr shiro higa from japan has
[SPEAKER_08]: incredible manuals on there and so but
that you know there's jadam the newer
[SPEAKER_08]: manuals you know using a lot of leaf molds
and things i think it's just use what you
[SPEAKER_08]: can to enhance your zone and try not to
get caught up in things that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know about and a lot of these natural
farming techniques are really to speed up
[SPEAKER_00]: what nature is already doing at a really
slow rate which is making a soil that's
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a wonderful microbiology medium
and with all of these different modalities
[SPEAKER_00]: it's speeding up the process so that we
can farm and we can get those nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: faster it's sort of part of farming that
you know you want to be adding a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch rather than waiting for the mulch to
come by the leaves falling so you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you're speeding up the process of getting
rich soil and and and having healthier
[SPEAKER_08]: plants and hey mark scaldone how you doing
you know maybe uh you i don't know if you
[SPEAKER_08]: could talk about endophytic fungi and
bacteria maybe you can but you know part
[SPEAKER_08]: of living soils and all this crazy natural
farming stuff is to create a healthy plant
[SPEAKER_08]: to it to supposedly extract or to use in
full but i just wonder what you're up to
[SPEAKER_13]: mark and and what's happening with you
well hey everybody uh i was out in the
[SPEAKER_13]: gallery last week listening i was uh what
was i doing i was like cleaning the house
[SPEAKER_13]: i uh but i listened last week it was a
good episode and uh yeah for some reason i
[SPEAKER_13]: didn't get the link but i got it this week
so hi everybody uh great to see everybody
[SPEAKER_13]: um yeah you know part of the essential
role that biology plays in the soil is
[SPEAKER_13]: because um biology has figured out how to
fix nitrogen from the air and nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_13]: this um wonderfully abundant uh gas that's
in the oxygen in the air or not in the
[SPEAKER_13]: oxygen it's in the air we breathe it's in
the atmosphere i think 79 is nitrogen
[SPEAKER_13]: right and it's pretty inert it's pretty
what we call inert it's chemically inert
[SPEAKER_13]: there are things that react with nitrogen
but for the most part bacteria have
[SPEAKER_13]: figured out how to fix nitrogen and the
reason why that's important and they don't
[SPEAKER_13]: spend a lot of energy doing it that's
that's the other important thing so man's
[SPEAKER_13]: figured out how to fix nitrogen but it
costs a lot of petrochemical derived
[SPEAKER_13]: energy to do it and that's something
called the the haber process which was
[SPEAKER_13]: basically how to turn nitrogen into
ammonia which created liquid fertilizers
[SPEAKER_13]: that began the whole you know use of
chemicals to fortify soil i think josh and
[SPEAKER_13]: kelly will agree that bacteria have have
long since figured this out because
[SPEAKER_13]: they've been playing chemistry in mother
nature's lab here for billions of years
[SPEAKER_13]: but you know franz haber did i mean it was
it was important at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_13]: industrial revolution when they figured
out how to fix nitrogen because it really
[SPEAKER_13]: it started the whole chemical industry
mostly again for making liquid fertilizers
[SPEAKER_13]: because you know they just hadn't figured
out um they hadn't figured out
[SPEAKER_13]: regenerative farming at the time they
actually did but they didn't know it right
[SPEAKER_13]: and you know it's funny uh josh the the
point you made about making stinky fish
[SPEAKER_13]: broth and that's how you can grow stinky
weed you know for us kids who are out on
[SPEAKER_13]: grateful dead tour during the 80s you know
for a lot of us you know grateful dead
[SPEAKER_13]: tour was where we went out we got our
stinky weed and yeah i remember talking to
[SPEAKER_13]: some growers who were like man we take
everything from the apple orchard and we
[SPEAKER_13]: take everything from our garden and we
just we make this compost of just just
[SPEAKER_13]: just the richest darkest soil you could
possibly imagine and in that you know they
[SPEAKER_13]: created you know these really aromatic
varieties of of of weed that would fill
[SPEAKER_13]: arenas on east coast dead tours with the
smoke of norcal right and so yeah so i
[SPEAKER_08]: would also say southern oregon just just
saying yeah oregon truth in that garcia
[SPEAKER_13]: well you know and and and the dead were
connected to oregon because as you know
[SPEAKER_13]: like ramrod and sparky and most of the
crew they were all from oregon and kesey
[SPEAKER_13]: they were all from oregon so that the trip
carolyn garcia that that that's right so
[SPEAKER_13]: the grateful dead scene down in the bay
and and oregon was was was was connected
[SPEAKER_13]: and um yeah i mean you guys are connected
with mountain girl and you know mountain
[SPEAKER_13]: girl wrote one of the first uh seminal
textbooks on on regenerative growing and
[SPEAKER_13]: then is is that is that right and can i
say that is that right it's definitely
[SPEAKER_08]: right 1976 the primo plant and it's
specific to regenerative growing like
[SPEAKER_08]: there wasn't a oh yeah no her her father
is a botanist she came from growing she
[SPEAKER_13]: loves weed she's super inquisitive she's
an awesome person what a cool time in
[SPEAKER_13]: grateful dead history you know because
that's right when when when trixie and
[SPEAKER_13]: annabelle were were were young kids and
and jerry was they were living in stinson
[SPEAKER_08]: beach and jerry was in well they you know
she they had gone and left and gone up to
[SPEAKER_08]: oregon at that time because there was so
many they had got you know that there's
[SPEAKER_08]: like issues in california and they were
fleeing they're like kind of like left the
[SPEAKER_08]: california scene and lived on the coast
over in port orford and lived over in the
[SPEAKER_08]: beach so a lot that was a lot of that was
written while they were you know had kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of left they said left the scene or
whatever and went up to oregon and things
[SPEAKER_13]: so yeah right but it's all still it's just
a wonderful time of of uh all kinds of
[SPEAKER_13]: things going on in the scene and and you
know me being a young kid from from the
[SPEAKER_13]: from the east coast to me again a lot of
us it was uh uh for many years easier to
[SPEAKER_13]: get things like cocaine from new york city
you know you could just drive over the
[SPEAKER_13]: george washington bridge and go get a
little sack of cocaine go back to your
[SPEAKER_13]: suburban party in new york city and and
the only weed that you can get was this
[SPEAKER_13]: little manila envelope which was chuck
full of seeds and stems it was just the
[SPEAKER_13]: worst thing in the world but on dead tour
we had stinky green bud from the from the
[SPEAKER_13]: west coast i know i said it a bunch of
times on hashtags but hey that's for the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog it's pretty cool because you know
i was i was slinging the kind bud i mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how i made my way through
university university of oregon thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: very much for the degree everybody for off
the kind bud um well and little did i know
[SPEAKER_00]: that that that kind bud was dj shorts
blueberry strains and that was all coming
[SPEAKER_13]: from him and and marcus will tell you that
that easily transitioned from kind of like
[SPEAKER_13]: the grateful dead scene over to fish fish
was certainly the people who took the
[SPEAKER_13]: torch from the grateful dead and carried
it on because again you can go on fish
[SPEAKER_13]: scene and you can get really kind stinky
nugs in the mid 90s right mark and it
[SPEAKER_13]: wasn't beasters you know when you guys
were talking about beasters before that's
[SPEAKER_13]: funny because i remember people slinging
beasters on fish lot and be like yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah we let's you know it looked good it
just didn't it didn't it wasn't it wasn't
[SPEAKER_13]: as good as all the other shit and that's
right around the time that again chem dog
[SPEAKER_13]: really started taking off sour diesel
started taking off the late to mid 90s and
[SPEAKER_13]: then you know right around that time i
would say that you know again is there
[SPEAKER_13]: again a sort of like a next generation
that sort of took really good weed and
[SPEAKER_13]: made sure that you know it was just
distributed to the masses or i'll tell you
[SPEAKER_13]: music or things that were were cultural
icons that brought people in and were like
[SPEAKER_13]: holy shit did you smell that weed that's
not like the shit that we get at home
[SPEAKER_13]: let's go buy some weed so people would go
to the shows stock up on weed and go home
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a dangerous time i would like to
say because first of all great weed stinks
[SPEAKER_03]: loud and you go to these shows in the
early to mid 90s on the east coast the
[SPEAKER_03]: midwest even on the west coast to a degree
but more so in places like montana and
[SPEAKER_03]: even spokane but like on the east coast
all these different shows in new york cops
[SPEAKER_03]: would literally sit in buildings around
the parking lots with walkie talkies and
[SPEAKER_03]: then literally just have people get busted
on on the lot like it was a dangerous game
[SPEAKER_03]: we were playing and yet you couldn't not
go and play the game the beautiful thing
[SPEAKER_08]: was in the parking lot if anyone has ever
identified as a narc there would be
[SPEAKER_08]: probably 15 people walking around the dude
going narc narc narc this guy's a narc
[SPEAKER_03]: well on on fish tour it was six up six six
up six up meant there were cops heading
[SPEAKER_03]: your way they could be undercover they
could be uh uniform but if you heard that
[SPEAKER_03]: six up it was like a wave traveling with
them as the they walked down shake down
[SPEAKER_15]: everything would roll right up man you
just watch everybody just pull their shit
[SPEAKER_13]: up and start stepping how key do you think
those years you know the grateful dead
[SPEAKER_13]: touring years and then like mark like the
years that you're on fish tour and like
[SPEAKER_13]: the mid 90s into this next millennium how
important do you think that those years
[SPEAKER_13]: were in the proliferation of really good
herb out to the masses of people right so
[SPEAKER_08]: important it was important right along
with psychedelic mushrooms and lsd i used
[SPEAKER_14]: to walk around fish lot uh late 90s with
overgrow flyers and hand them out to get
[SPEAKER_14]: people stoked on going and learning about
growing i was that just passionate about
[SPEAKER_14]: the plant it was just people thought i was
crazy like what are you doing why are you
[SPEAKER_14]: printing these things like scoosh actually
sent me a flyer from overgrow to hand out
[SPEAKER_14]: and i i was like look i'm gonna go to all
these shows and i want to pass this out i
[SPEAKER_14]: feel like we need to we need to share this
like people need to know there's knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: out there that you can learn i would send
slinger with bubble bags on the you know
[SPEAKER_03]: to the great went or to like these huge
fish and i'd be like just take like a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred kits you know i'll give you a
hundred and be like you'd be like all
[SPEAKER_03]: right bro all right and just like young
slinger you know trying to like with a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred kits of bubble bags and fucking
meeting the whole crew or we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: seminal for the for the new year show and
marcel brought the fish 2000 pipe and
[SPEAKER_13]: bubble bags that were sold at the parking
lots of fish shows is that what was that
[SPEAKER_13]: what i'm hearing here oh yeah dude 100 99
man like there's there's hash that's been
[SPEAKER_13]: made from bubble bags sold at the parking
lot of fish i used to there's hash that's
[SPEAKER_03]: been made there's hash that's been made in
the parking lot of fish shows i bartered
[SPEAKER_03]: personally bubble hash for tickets
literally you could go to a fish show with
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing but six star bubble and you have
everything you do this is the truth dr
[SPEAKER_16]: bark i would say for sure back in the day
like when i was in west virginia all we
[SPEAKER_16]: would get is uh pressed mexican coca cola
so when we heard about good weed we heard
[SPEAKER_16]: the dead would come through my ass would
go up to pittsburgh and and just roll
[SPEAKER_16]: through shakedown street and i'd get
griefed they'd be like sorry motherfucker
[SPEAKER_16]: you're bald i'm like no no no i'm not a
narc i'm not a cop i just want some
[SPEAKER_16]: fucking you're gassy fucking weed and once
i got turned onto that weed and then but
[SPEAKER_16]: then we were back back when i finally
didn't stay for the show you turned around
[SPEAKER_16]: and went home right well no i never got to
the shows no no i only went for the drugs
[SPEAKER_16]: i wasn't into the music i was a punk you
know you know i was i had you know i had
[SPEAKER_16]: my vet i had my boots on and my braces you
know i was a sharp skinheads against
[SPEAKER_16]: racial prejudice so we beat up nazis but
you know you still roll in bald they're
[SPEAKER_16]: like you're a fucking cop i'm like no no
i'm in the military i'm in the national
[SPEAKER_16]: guard but i need some weed because i'm a
patient now but you can't really talk
[SPEAKER_16]: about that because there's so much fucking
music and people are like shroom shrooms
[SPEAKER_16]: weed bud bud bud so you know you gotta
it's it's so tricky back then but when we
[SPEAKER_16]: got to california and then of course we're
here at the dead shows when i was with the
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis action network they would let us
set up legally on shakedown street right
[SPEAKER_16]: and then they would let us go inside and
gather signatures and that's how i met
[SPEAKER_16]: bear and everybody else but even still
back then when i was with can and i was
[SPEAKER_16]: balled behind the thing they'd be like you
sure you're not a cop like i'm on
[SPEAKER_16]: shakedown 30 people around me yelling narc
right now and people they'd look around
[SPEAKER_16]: and people like yeah yeah yeah oh yeah we
wouldn't fuck that that's that's how
[SPEAKER_16]: justice goes here he'd be fucking shown
the fuck off but look seriously what's
[SPEAKER_16]: known as the dead lot and going around and
traveling around i do not think we would
[SPEAKER_16]: see the proliferation of cannabis and the
high quality of cannabis in the time that
[SPEAKER_16]: we did because there was no understanding
that that quality was there and once i had
[SPEAKER_16]: tried it from somebody who had a dead lot
when i was in fucking west virginia i was
[SPEAKER_16]: like i gotta go to a fucking dead show and
get some fucking weed because that's where
[SPEAKER_16]: real weed is because whatever i'm getting
and selling isn't real fucking weed that's
[SPEAKER_16]: just how europe you're a bald head dread
yes yes totally bald dread yes absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: called me yes so many times i would go out
onto dead tour with with you know
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful kind but and people didn't even
know that it was weed no joke way back in
[SPEAKER_00]: you know like the early early 90s late 80s
i'd have a nice sack of weed and people
[SPEAKER_00]: would be like that's not weed what are you
trying to sell me what is that i'd be like
[SPEAKER_00]: no it's it's kind but this is really weed
or the first time they didn't even really
[SPEAKER_00]: know what it was or yeah the first time
that people had ever seen keith or just
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're just separating so you know
before there was bubble you know there was
[SPEAKER_00]: keith and people were using keith and at
dead tour you would get these little teeny
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny gorgeous pressed blocks tiny little
pressed blocks of keith that was so
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting you know to to be able to smoke
that and feel that high i remember that
[SPEAKER_03]: well i had i actually when i got busted
back in the late 90s with many pounds of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis i had a little rock of beautiful
keith that was just like clean keith that
[SPEAKER_03]: was like rocked up and they thought it was
crack cocaine they tested it until it was
[SPEAKER_03]: gone and then i couldn't get charged for
that particular batch but it reminds me
[SPEAKER_03]: what you just said of when i first started
posting on overgrow in 1999 bubble hash
[SPEAKER_03]: and people would be like that looks like
mr whippy mouse shit like there's no way
[SPEAKER_03]: that that's hash like they just people
didn't know and when i put it in their
[SPEAKER_03]: pipes and it would bubble and boil and
melt into a liquid they would just be like
[SPEAKER_03]: what the fuck is that like is that some
like that i don't think that was hash that
[SPEAKER_03]: that guy smoked with us plus back then
because it was so unknown it used to and
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe sam could agree with me i don't see
people getting knocked out the way i used
[SPEAKER_03]: to people used to fall like flies when
they smoked bubble for the first time and
[SPEAKER_03]: i'm sure sam has stories of of his dry
sift way before bubble was even a glimmer
[SPEAKER_05]: uh in in the eye yeah but to tell you the
truth even cannabis back in those days uh
[SPEAKER_05]: i mean i saw people smoke original haze in
the early 70s and they would turn white
[SPEAKER_05]: and pass out or throw up so i mean it's
just the relative if you used to smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: you know 10 and all of a sudden you hit
something that's you know 50 60 70 80 uh
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah it is you'll you'll turn white you'll
turn pale your your heart yeah i mean you
[SPEAKER_16]: know you've seen it happen a million times
well not only that you also had a huge
[SPEAKER_16]: proliferation because people weren't just
going to smoke this amazing weed and hash
[SPEAKER_16]: just out of anything this is when the snot
grass and everything started to appear i
[SPEAKER_16]: mean johnny b is showing his huge chalice
over here i mean this was a huge
[SPEAKER_16]: proliferation i mean if it wasn't for the
dead lot and the turning on the fish scene
[SPEAKER_16]: i mean how would the glass you know whole
art thing that is taken off that is a
[SPEAKER_16]: whole underground art movement here in
america i mean it would have never taken a
[SPEAKER_16]: hold i mean snot grass was gone i mean
guys would always whip out and say oh this
[SPEAKER_16]: is a snotty this pipe costs thousand two
twelve hundred dollars you're like holy
[SPEAKER_16]: shit you spend how much on a glass pipe
this is an original snot grass right here
[SPEAKER_14]: actually this was gifted to me by a friend
of mine i've had this since 90 something
[SPEAKER_14]: mid 90s i've had this um this is that's
very valuable this to me is very valuable
[SPEAKER_14]: to me people have asked me how much i'm
like there is no price on my soul um we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get bob on here let's get bob on
oh yeah yeah and carolyn garcia and
[SPEAKER_03]: carolyn i'm telling you the last she
phoned me a while ago and was like hey am
[SPEAKER_03]: i still gonna come on hash church i was
like what happened i love this this is
[SPEAKER_03]: such a beautiful she's like it's josh and
kelly's friend carolyn i'm like carolyn
[SPEAKER_07]: carolyn i've never been to a fish concert
and when i was in mexico in 2017 and can't
[SPEAKER_07]: it was cancuno is in uh just outside of
mexico and there was a fish concert there
[SPEAKER_07]: and i was on the on the suite at the front
where there was no one in front of me just
[SPEAKER_07]: the ocean at eight a.m i'm down there and
i hear this johnny fucking b and the girls
[SPEAKER_07]: were she's just like are you kidding me
and i go out there and there's all these
[SPEAKER_07]: people from fish that i've never met
before and and i met them all because of
[SPEAKER_07]: hash church and they're all like johnny b
johnny b and it just felt so amazing and
[SPEAKER_07]: at that time and where i was i was in
mexico i marked marco arrendez and i
[SPEAKER_07]: actually picked up this pipe that was
blown at a fish concert by slinger and got
[SPEAKER_07]: his hat on here and stuff like that and i
brought it home because it was a memory
[SPEAKER_07]: that had to come back to can it's way i
look at it so it's just pretty cool show
[SPEAKER_14]: that pipe a little bit i was gonna comment
on your hat the slinger hat caught me in
[SPEAKER_07]: the oh this was made at an ungrateful dead
concert this is uh from what i understand
[SPEAKER_07]: um this is this is a slinger this is a
collab this is because someone's torches
[SPEAKER_03]: were stolen or something yeah oh right
right right yeah let me think about that
[SPEAKER_03]: we gotta get slick we gotta get slinger in
some of the glass community on here one
[SPEAKER_07]: day as well someone mentioned it in the
chat this is some epic piece that i i know
[SPEAKER_07]: a little about but not too much but i know
dave knows a lot about it so does uh real
[SPEAKER_07]: high integrity and they told me some cool
stuff about it and they're like this is a
[SPEAKER_07]: classic so i'm about ready to smoke some
bubble out of this thing for the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time ever with you guys i remember when
jason lee figured out that particular weld
[SPEAKER_03]: and showed slinger and i remember when
they all started doing it it was during
[SPEAKER_03]: overgrow days actually and they would do
um first they did the double bubbler then
[SPEAKER_03]: they did the triple then they did the quad
then they did this the the five and then
[SPEAKER_03]: they did the sex tupler and i i bought
them all i had the sex tupler i ended up
[SPEAKER_03]: selling that to a drum from amsterdam
ended up fixing it one day because it got
[SPEAKER_03]: broken there and he did a pretty good job
fixing it but instead of cleaning it he
[SPEAKER_03]: just heated it up while it was all still
dirty and so it fumed the the gold clear
[SPEAKER_03]: glass so it was almost like this metallic
black looked pretty cool i think i think
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe like soma or gypsy nirvana or some
one of those characters ended up with that
[SPEAKER_07]: piece but uh i know there's still
cosplayers on this one because this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain wall that's d-rack at the back
there that marble looks like slinger
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the uranium marble i have a few of
those very same ones yeah slinger would
[SPEAKER_07]: have done that for sure and as there's a
piece that went in here like some kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: a tool that's i guess maybe because now
it's a little sword in there but uh yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: it's definitely uh it chugs nicely marcus
what year did you first what year did you
[SPEAKER_05]: first smoke homegrown here we go jeez the
first year i smoked homegrown with me it
[SPEAKER_03]: was 69 or 70 it would have been 87 for me
90 for me 1987 wow how time flies i've
[SPEAKER_07]: told the story quite a few times wow that
hit really nicely that was awesome 93 for
[SPEAKER_08]: me 80 early 80s for me because it was all
homegrown yeah and me was all me was all
[SPEAKER_00]: mexican and then in arizona and i didn't
really get any awesome good weed until i
[SPEAKER_00]: uh started smoking on matanuska
thunderfuck in 1988 so that was the that
[SPEAKER_08]: was the best homegrown my parents are some
friends original growers in southern or
[SPEAKER_08]: original mass we have giant big fat kind
bud colas and and by the late 70s by by
[SPEAKER_08]: the mid to late 70s and i have pictures of
my parent you know family holding it and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff and is is definitely awesome i i'm
lucky i never went through the era of not
[SPEAKER_08]: having good weed around ever like wow how
lucky is that another thing is beyond
[SPEAKER_08]: grateful dead uh was the barter fair lots
barter fairs so barter fairs were a really
[SPEAKER_08]: big deal you know we'll see we'll just and
and tenasca and and washington was where
[SPEAKER_08]: you know the u.s and canada met up and the
tenasca barter fair was really cool but
[SPEAKER_08]: you know hey family we got to take off
right now we're going to go help some
[SPEAKER_08]: local kootenay growers out we're going to
go help trim out some uh some black dough
[SPEAKER_08]: lotto some blackberry kush by the dosey
dough by the gelato from the uh uh jordan
[SPEAKER_00]: of the island seed bank down a twin
feathers farm and we're also working a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: on getting getting something up to all of
canada in the medical realm up online so
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be letting you all know about that
as soon as that starts happening and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: again marcus and everybody you know you
just you make my week you make my day when
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm having whatever i think about hash
church and i think of all of your shining
[SPEAKER_00]: faces and the people that you all are and
and i just i just have so much love for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you and marcus what you have put on
all of these years and and the incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: honoring of the cannabis plant that just
continues to happen on this show it's just
[SPEAKER_08]: second to none thank you so much and big
up mark for the hash church strain nice
[SPEAKER_08]: work brother big up on you we'll be stoked
if we get to put that in our yard this
[SPEAKER_08]: year big up everyone everyone out in the
crowd every other podcast that's ever
[SPEAKER_08]: happened every other person putting
education first let's make this world a
[SPEAKER_08]: better place the government's not here to
serve us we're here to serve us we love
[SPEAKER_08]: you give us a call if you need anything be
healthy we're always available to anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that ever has any questions or anything
hit us up always we just want to help out
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as we possibly can we're servants
of this plant just like so many of you all
[SPEAKER_08]: out there watching resist the military
industrial complex i love you nice i like
[SPEAKER_03]: it good words dropped from the dragonfly
earth medicine josh and kelly always
[SPEAKER_14]: marcus i wanted to to talk about bog for a
second if that's all yes i would love for
[SPEAKER_03]: you i wanted to talk about bog as well and
seeing as we talked about overgrow and all
[SPEAKER_03]: those other those characters we got to
talk about bog one of the ogs yeah so for
[SPEAKER_14]: those of you guys out there um that don't
know bog was an incredible breeder uh
[SPEAKER_14]: activist grower family guy beautiful human
being uh gifted so many seeds probably
[SPEAKER_14]: more seeds were gifted by him than he sold
um and we lost him this past year to uh
[SPEAKER_14]: complications we don't know about but um
wanted to let everybody know that um james
[SPEAKER_14]: bean sees here now um and a bunch of other
people like me and jean from freeborn
[SPEAKER_14]: selections and i think miss jill is
involved and james loud and all these
[SPEAKER_14]: different individuals are all coming
together um to do bids for bog um so if
[SPEAKER_14]: you guys are on ig please go follow uh
bids for bog and there's amazing gear
[SPEAKER_14]: going up every single day to benefit um
his wife pat and i think that um it would
[SPEAKER_14]: be a really great thing for everybody in
this community that follows hash church
[SPEAKER_14]: and everything that's going on here to um
to get involved and and to help um it's a
[SPEAKER_14]: hard time out there and i i think you know
the least we could do is try to support a
[SPEAKER_14]: fellow community member um and their
family when we can let's light one up for
[SPEAKER_16]: bog everybody let's have a nice round of
uh bong rips all the way around i'll puff
[SPEAKER_14]: to that um bog's varieties were really
easy to grow for those of you guys that
[SPEAKER_14]: are um out there that are new um and even
experienced growers like sour bubble is an
[SPEAKER_14]: incredible variety great hash maker um and
something that you guys can all kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: put in your garden and really uh it'll
accentuate anything you have in there
[SPEAKER_14]: whether it's a newer gelato or an older
super skunk or a skunk well when i met him
[SPEAKER_05]: years and years ago here in amsterdam uh
he his most famous at that time was bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: gum yeah he had a nice he had a nice
bubble gum that is for sure i puffed some
[SPEAKER_03]: melt on that more than more than a few
times with bog what do you uh what's
[SPEAKER_16]: everybody puffing on what are you puffing
on marcus i am puffing on some
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrated x it is the cookies and cream
and if you take a really close-up shot it
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of looks like macaroni and cheese or
kind of looks like some other crazy shit
[SPEAKER_03]: it is absolutely fucking stellar hash
rosin look top if i was telling my french
[SPEAKER_03]: friends it is absolute damn near
perfection shout out to concentrated x
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what's going into my banger and i'm
going to do a cold start because why not i
[SPEAKER_07]: like the cold start so i'm i'm puffing
this is the many curse that i did the
[SPEAKER_07]: fresh frozen from from my last grow and
with this one i put it in the freeze dryer
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was all so this is the 73 90 and
120 i was going to press it but it melts
[SPEAKER_07]: so i'm not pressing it so i mean smoking
it so longer next up
[SPEAKER_10]: just so happens fellows i'm i got some a
little bit of uh hash church flour rosin
[SPEAKER_10]: it's all buttered up nice just a tiny
little bit i pressed this morning it
[SPEAKER_10]: buttered us up pretty much instantly mine
did the same thing and looked the exact
[SPEAKER_10]: same color super light yeah and just to
clarify uh at the end there earlier you
[SPEAKER_10]: asked me about the yield on it and i kind
of fucked that up um it i'm getting about
[SPEAKER_10]: in a four by four area whether it's a
single plant or four plants i'm getting
[SPEAKER_10]: about just under a pound so not too bad
but not the best yeah no that's still
[SPEAKER_16]: solid for what you're getting reaping and
trikes you know i got star dog here i
[SPEAKER_14]: guess my background is just unbelievable
seminar star dog and garlic and then i
[SPEAKER_14]: also have a little lemon cake here um 90
120 and then i also have uh some 73 right
[SPEAKER_13]: here so i was i was interested interested
because i was listening last week and uh
[SPEAKER_13]: you guys were talking about the past
church strain and that's that's really
[SPEAKER_13]: cool that there's actually one that exists
so as you know what what makes these you
[SPEAKER_13]: know strain i don't like using the word
strain variety cultivar whatever chemovar
[SPEAKER_13]: what makes these things unique are the uh
you know phytochemical profile so what's
[SPEAKER_13]: the what's the cannabinoid profile and the
terpene profile in this in this new
[SPEAKER_10]: variety here do we know uh so what what
i've had tested so far and it's been at a
[SPEAKER_10]: fairly small lab so it's not a
commercialized lab by any means they do
[SPEAKER_10]: have good equipment but what i've gotten
so far is just the thc test back and it
[SPEAKER_10]: come back at 26 6.3 um i'm just waiting on
the terpenes to come back at this point
[SPEAKER_13]: right so that's the only uh cannabinoid
that is uh is shows up in the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_13]: profile of the of the of the biomass of
the plant material well i actually had it
[SPEAKER_10]: tested through a friend of mine and that's
pretty much the only thing that they've
[SPEAKER_10]: given me so far um they're supposed to be
doing a full profile of terpenes on it
[SPEAKER_10]: here shortly
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah typically they'll do a profile of at
least no less than seven of the major
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoids you know because they all
have hopefully standards in their hplc to
[SPEAKER_13]: tell you what the minor profile and yeah
you'd expect because it's a strain that
[SPEAKER_13]: gets you high you kind of know it's it's
got thc in it so what makes it unique are
[SPEAKER_13]: all the other minor cannabinoids that are
around the thc not necessarily the thc i
[SPEAKER_05]: think what's even more important i
couldn't agree more is the terpenes yeah
[SPEAKER_13]: well terpenes too yeah the entire
phytochemical profile which includes the
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes but most you know when you look
at most smoking marijuana it's what
[SPEAKER_05]: basically just thc with little or none of
the minor terpenes or cannabinoids excuse
[SPEAKER_13]: me uh that's not true at all that's not
that's that's that's not that you you're
[SPEAKER_13]: not looking at data on of commercial
cannabis and that's just not true at all
[SPEAKER_13]: there's a whole bunch of the minor
cannabinoids that are in there as much as
[SPEAKER_13]: a fraction to a single digit percent of
cbc cbg there's varieties that are out
[SPEAKER_13]: there that are two to one six to one seven
to one cbd i mean cbd is all throughout
[SPEAKER_05]: the commerce chain now most of those
weren't read most of those weren't bred
[SPEAKER_05]: for for to be smoking marijuana they they
were they're a newer variety with medical
[SPEAKER_05]: because when you look at the traditional
analysis it's really just thc uh with
[SPEAKER_05]: little of the other cannabinoids until
indica or widely started being used
[SPEAKER_05]: because it had a lot of the minor
cannabinoids but ganja tie stick columbia
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff like that was really just mostly
thc a little bit above the thing yeah well
[SPEAKER_13]: it depends what you mean by a little bit
so today's hplc methods pick up what that
[SPEAKER_13]: little bit is and what that little bit
ends up being you know a few percent and a
[SPEAKER_13]: few percent looking at the picture of the
mona lisa from across the street you kind
[SPEAKER_13]: of know there's thc in there right so
forget about the woman in the picture look
[SPEAKER_13]: at everything else and everything else is
yes the terpene profile the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_13]: profile we know these things are monsters
that create a lot of thc you kind of got
[SPEAKER_13]: to look beyond the thc to really find the
really unique right but also you got to
[SPEAKER_05]: remember something else mark the other
cannabinoids don't get too high and they
[SPEAKER_13]: have a very minor that's yeah but they
have this you know onto our what would we
[SPEAKER_13]: call it on this show ensemble effect well
i i tell you what though i mean i i hear
[SPEAKER_13]: this more and more and again because i've
been doing lots of work in the hemp space
[SPEAKER_13]: there's real uh real thing when it comes
to that minor cannabinoid profile that's
[SPEAKER_13]: in full spectrum oils that just aren't in
isolates and i've seen it i i've gotten
[SPEAKER_13]: witness testimony witness testimony
feedback on products where they're like oh
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah this is it's all about there is some
full spectrum biological efficacy and
[SPEAKER_13]: that's why i ask about the minor
cannabinoid profile because i think there
[SPEAKER_13]: is something about the minor cannabinoid
profile that drives that full spectrum
[SPEAKER_03]: you're both right you're just talking
about different things of course what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're saying mark is totally true and sam
himself is one of the people who started
[SPEAKER_03]: that discussion in early 2000 when he had
all the variety of definitely you were you
[SPEAKER_03]: were no doubt about it yet i also see
where sam's coming from where he's looking
[SPEAKER_03]: about he's looking about getting high he's
just looking for that rip that gets him
[SPEAKER_03]: high and when he says those other minor
cannabinoids they don't do anything for
[SPEAKER_03]: for that particular thing in him you know
but that's not to say that a full spectrum
[SPEAKER_03]: oil is not going to be more appreciated uh
from a medical patient suffering from some
[SPEAKER_05]: sensitive disorder and i can appreciate
that really easily that medical people
[SPEAKER_05]: have different priorities and different
needs and different ones yeah i totally
[SPEAKER_13]: understand that i almost think of it like
like almost like a volume like a volume
[SPEAKER_13]: issue and that people who listen to music
at a lower volume than you do sam those
[SPEAKER_13]: minor things make make a difference and so
people who use less thc you have like a
[SPEAKER_13]: lower tolerance than say like heavy users
than us you know people who use a lot
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe that doesn't really impact but
people who are lighter users i think that
[SPEAKER_13]: minor cannabinoid profile that full
spectrum uh uh bioefficacy is a is a real
[SPEAKER_03]: thing i will also add that in canada i've
seen a so many coas i can't even explain
[SPEAKER_03]: how many coas i've seen and they are very
often not ripe with minor cannabinoids it
[SPEAKER_03]: seems to be more often than not it's a
decent terpene profile and then it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be thc somewhere between you know 12
and and 28 percent or something like that
[SPEAKER_13]: and this is in the legal itself what's
that mark he's right here on your test
[SPEAKER_03]: results on biomass on plant material yeah
of course we can't process anything until
[SPEAKER_03]: we see
[SPEAKER_07]: so here's here's something that's 240
milligrams now these don't do anything to
[SPEAKER_07]: me i take a i took a couple of them last
week i got a little bit of anxiety from it
[SPEAKER_07]: but most people these are flooring them
someone like sam and myself i i'd like i i
[SPEAKER_07]: was talking about this i think the cvd is
blocking those those different and those
[SPEAKER_07]: different cannabinoids are because i mean
this is a full profile basically this is
[SPEAKER_07]: what i'm using for my painting right now
and this seems to be working and it
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't get me high it just actually helps
ease my pain so i mean these are the
[SPEAKER_07]: different cannabinoids that we will be
talking about all right i wanted to do a
[SPEAKER_16]: clarification for those who are watching
uh as you know uh dr mishulin says uh it's
[SPEAKER_16]: the entourage effect but if you actually
look at nomenclature entourage is just a
[SPEAKER_16]: group of people arriving together uh
whereas uh ensemble is exactly like
[SPEAKER_16]: listening to an orchestra if you're
listening to one note you hear the horns
[SPEAKER_16]: but when you hear the whole orchestra
that's the ensemble and so that's why i
[SPEAKER_16]: and others have coined the phrase the
ensemble effect so just to clarify it for
[SPEAKER_16]: new people who are watching who are saying
entourage so just wanted to clarify so uh
[SPEAKER_14]: i wanted to bring up a thing i sent a coa
number over to you marcus that was 101.75
[SPEAKER_03]: came back from i remember that was great
job separating great job for breaching the
[SPEAKER_14]: laws of everything of of of of yeah
breaching the laws of redefining physics
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah um it uh so i just wanted to just
talk about this idea because i think
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a lot of um a lot of nuance with
all these terms and things that we've we
[SPEAKER_14]: have and pop culture seems to move way
faster than science and for some reason in
[SPEAKER_14]: this field so dr mark in your professional
opinion um where does 101.75 really make
[SPEAKER_14]: sense i know that there's minors put in
there but when the thca comes back at
[SPEAKER_14]: 98.98 and then there's like all these
other minors it just feels odd just to
[SPEAKER_14]: read that and then put that on a package
for a patient just because i just feel
[SPEAKER_14]: like we're at a zero to 100 range at what
point do we feel like it's okay to have
[SPEAKER_14]: the liberty to go beyond these lines and
what does that really mean yeah as we know
[SPEAKER_14]: means absolutely nothing um there's so
much more uh to the ensemble and and as
[SPEAKER_14]: you really beautifully put it the dynamics
um if you're using uh recording
[SPEAKER_14]: instruments you know for an example you
want to record things at a low level with
[SPEAKER_14]: great compressors and eqs and you know and
all that dynamics really adds to the
[SPEAKER_14]: overall experience to that sound so what's
your take on that so so there's two things
[SPEAKER_13]: you got to consider so when you're when
you're when you're trying to measure
[SPEAKER_13]: potency when you're trying to measure the
amount of a cannabinoid either like in
[SPEAKER_13]: hash or in flour um it's 90 of it is how
you prepare the sample and so like in a
[SPEAKER_13]: typical hplc method you would take
something like about a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_13]: milligrams of material and you have to
weigh it out like you can't weigh out just
[SPEAKER_13]: well this is almost 200 milligrams it has
to be 200.12 milligrams it can't be 200.13
[SPEAKER_13]: or two that level of precision will have
an impact on the measurement you're making
[SPEAKER_13]: because what you're doing is you're taking
that measured amount of stuff and then
[SPEAKER_13]: you're going to do a number of dilutions
to it and every time you do a dilution to
[SPEAKER_13]: it you you basically are are um I was
gonna say diluting it right you know
[SPEAKER_13]: you're you're making it less concentrated
until it gets down to the level of
[SPEAKER_13]: concentration that your machine is
calibrated to read now these machines
[SPEAKER_13]: separate things I know Marcus we've talked
about hplc a lot on on on hash church and
[SPEAKER_13]: we've had people like uh from sc labs his
name is escaping me right now alec yeah
[SPEAKER_13]: people talk about hplc but how an hplc
works is there there's a column that you
[SPEAKER_13]: take this diluted solution of your of your
sample and the sample goes through the
[SPEAKER_13]: column and the column think of it like a
uh like a water filter cartridge like
[SPEAKER_13]: that's on your refrigerator if you have
filtered water that comes through your
[SPEAKER_13]: refrigerator or your house or wherever so
as the solution goes through there the
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoids have a different affinity for
sticking to the packing material which is
[SPEAKER_13]: called the column and they allude out the
other end of the column and there's
[SPEAKER_13]: something called a detector that's looking
at a particular wavelength in the
[SPEAKER_13]: ultraviolet spectrum that knows what
wavelength each of the individual
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoids absorb at and so there's
something that they call standards and so
[SPEAKER_13]: in order to calibrate this machine
properly what they do is you have to buy a
[SPEAKER_13]: standard of each of the individual
purified cannabinoids right and then you
[SPEAKER_13]: take that standard and again you do what's
called serial dilutions which basically
[SPEAKER_13]: dilutes the concentration of that standard
and you inject this into your hplc column
[SPEAKER_13]: and what you see is yes johnny's showing
one right there what you see is that
[SPEAKER_13]: there's a linear response between the
amount of material that comes out and that
[SPEAKER_13]: dilution that you've made and you you read
what's called a calibration curve because
[SPEAKER_13]: the intensity that the detector picks up
of the compounds coming out of the column
[SPEAKER_13]: is directly proportional to how much of
that compound is in there and so for like
[SPEAKER_13]: 2500 ppm you'll get a signal up here and
then for like 500 ppm you'll get a signal
[SPEAKER_13]: down here and then for like 100 ppm it'll
be down here and so you'll draw what's
[SPEAKER_13]: called a calibration curve and now what
you can do with your calibration curve yes
[SPEAKER_13]: johnny's showing a chromatogram here so
johnny can now take the peak heights from
[SPEAKER_13]: that which is called the chromatogram
which is the reading of the detector as
[SPEAKER_13]: the compounds come out of the hplc go to
your calibration curve and say if that
[SPEAKER_13]: peak which is exactly that high is that
reads this on the calibration curve then
[SPEAKER_13]: the concentration is this you back it out
through your dilution calculation you can
[SPEAKER_13]: calculate how much canabinoid is actually
in a sample so you can see with all the
[SPEAKER_13]: mathematics that you need to do there and
all of the manipulation of the sample
[SPEAKER_13]: itself right because you have to weigh out
exactly to the you know what point zero
[SPEAKER_13]: zero zero zero one gram yeah you know
precision that means you need an
[SPEAKER_13]: analytical balance right there that costs
like what three four five thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_13]: i mean those are not cheap the hplc
machines most of them run somewhere
[SPEAKER_13]: between maybe 25 30 thousand dollars you
could get them used for less than that but
[SPEAKER_13]: the really good ones with the detectors
and then you have to buy the standards and
[SPEAKER_13]: the standards are really expensive because
the labs that make the standards have to
[SPEAKER_13]: have a schedule one license because they
have to have a lot of that material and
[SPEAKER_13]: then they dilute it down to the level that
the dea says is okay to ship off as a
[SPEAKER_13]: standard and a little bottle like this
right johnny costs like a thousand bucks
[SPEAKER_07]: it's really it's really expensive but at
the same time you just can't buy it not
[SPEAKER_07]: anyone can buy it so not only you can't
buy it i was lucky just the way things
[SPEAKER_13]: worked and that's that's why we need a
license they they don't they don't just
[SPEAKER_13]: give those standards out to anybody and
then there's another thing is that you
[SPEAKER_13]: know even these instrument manufacturers i
mean they will not unless you can show
[SPEAKER_13]: that you have a license to operate in your
state legally they're not going to sell
[SPEAKER_13]: you this instrumentation because they
don't want to be liable for some
[SPEAKER_13]: clandestine operation and so it's
important i guess to have standardized
[SPEAKER_13]: testing and all this but you can see that
it's really easy to come up with a result
[SPEAKER_13]: that's 101 percent because what that means
is that somewhere along the lines in the
[SPEAKER_13]: sample preparation most likely or in the
mathematics that takes the raw data that
[SPEAKER_13]: the machine measures and converts it into
milligram per gram cannabinoid or percent
[SPEAKER_13]: weight or whatever measurement unit you're
using all of that is going to be impacted
[SPEAKER_13]: on the sample that that the machine
measures the machine just is measuring its
[SPEAKER_13]: thing and then you have to assume that
these machines get clogged if people don't
[SPEAKER_13]: know what they're doing there's all kinds
of crap that goes in there we use these
[SPEAKER_13]: two micron syringe filters that are really
useful to filter out any crap because you
[SPEAKER_13]: don't want any crap going in there and if
you're testing a lot of biomass that
[SPEAKER_13]: already has a lot of fats waxes and lipids
it's really advisable to put what's called
[SPEAKER_13]: a guard on your column and what that does
is it it just it extends the lifetime of
[SPEAKER_13]: your column because it keeps a lot of the
high molecular weight shift from gumming
[SPEAKER_14]: up your column because once mark this this
material was was solventless thca that i
[SPEAKER_14]: had extracted mechanically so it came back
that high i just felt like i just couldn't
[SPEAKER_14]: i just don't it's like tall tales to me
you know yes so if your sample doesn't
[SPEAKER_13]: have doesn't have fats waxes or lipids
it's probably best to dissolve that in
[SPEAKER_13]: methanol but like johnny was seeing when
you dissolve samples that have fats waxes
[SPEAKER_13]: and lipids and methanol johnny remember
this
[SPEAKER_07]: years ago when it was interesting the way
i had to figure it out is because then i
[SPEAKER_07]: had put it in hexane and the hexane melted
the fats right yeah so i saw that we
[SPEAKER_07]: thought it was they thought it was stuff
coming from the parchment so then i called
[SPEAKER_07]: the parchment people and they're like
there's no fucking way the parchment is
[SPEAKER_07]: breaking down and that was had to do with
the rosin back then so it was a lot of fat
[SPEAKER_13]: when we were squishing so so so what that
says is that is as that part of what you
[SPEAKER_13]: weighed out as part of your analytical
sample is that fats waxes and lipids that
[SPEAKER_13]: that aren't being included so that whole
measurement is just that you can't
[SPEAKER_13]: quantify anything based on that but here's
the thing now like if you use something
[SPEAKER_13]: like acetone or something to dissolve all
that stuff now you're ramming all that
[SPEAKER_13]: shit into your those columns cost about a
thousand bucks a piece or they're you know
[SPEAKER_13]: they're expensive and the machine you're
running it on it's like you know 20 000
[SPEAKER_13]: dollar machine and it you know there's so
again answer your question column lots of
[SPEAKER_13]: places for that error to occur but if
you're looking to do like a purity
[SPEAKER_13]: analysis where you need to get like
absolute you know you have to do a lot of
[SPEAKER_13]: testing to develop a relationship with a
lab and i would say that alex operation sc
[SPEAKER_13]: is probably one of the more better ones i
don't know atn if you would agree but i
[SPEAKER_13]: would say the sc in general the steep hill
lab that we work with over here in
[SPEAKER_13]: maryland they're really good um there are
some labs they're really hit and miss
[SPEAKER_13]: because i've seen results on stuff that i
know that we've already tested and other
[SPEAKER_13]: people said they're like this is what
we're saying i'm like hey you know what we
[SPEAKER_13]: have the data to support it right i mean
that's what's good about the hplc is that
[SPEAKER_13]: if your analytical methods are all proper
and you have everything that you need to
[SPEAKER_13]: do you can challenge the results of some
marginal lab now what we found is some
[SPEAKER_13]: labs are in high throughput mode you know
why because their business model is to run
[SPEAKER_13]: as many fucking samples through that lab
as they possibly can do they give a shit
[SPEAKER_13]: whether it's point two point eight point
nine point they don't give a flying fuck
[SPEAKER_13]: they just want to get the report and get
their money that's it right so not us
[SPEAKER_13]: we're a little more careful because we
need to make sure especially in hemp
[SPEAKER_13]: operations that we're totally compliant
and you know what that means that means
[SPEAKER_13]: that you know your thc is compliant right
at that point three level and you know
[SPEAKER_13]: you're putting your business at risk if
you don't know what the hell it is you're
[SPEAKER_13]: sending out the door because that stuff
can be confiscated or other people are
[SPEAKER_13]: using those products again to formulate
into soaps or tinctures or whatever and if
[SPEAKER_13]: it's not at the right level then that
means their their doses aren't at the
[SPEAKER_13]: right level neither so it's really
important to have accurate testing all the
[SPEAKER_14]: lab that i use is is a well-known lab i
don't i don't this particular one i that's
[SPEAKER_14]: why it's surprising to me and it was just
it was just the whole thing surprising and
[SPEAKER_14]: and i see a lot because i'm always sending
samples out um like yourself you just just
[SPEAKER_07]: had to ask but here's these old samples
this is kind of some memories for me these
[SPEAKER_07]: are old so here's this little box that
they used to come and they used to come
[SPEAKER_07]: from switzerland we had to order them
through a different company sent to a
[SPEAKER_07]: different address it was they were so hard
to get in the freezer johnny oh these no
[SPEAKER_07]: these ones i have samples in my fridge the
ones for i had from hplc these are just
[SPEAKER_07]: the boxes from like 1988 that's all yeah
these are from like 1988 like so this is
[SPEAKER_07]: from 1988 oh my god yeah the other ones i
have are in the fridge i got those in like
[SPEAKER_07]: 2012 but these are when i first started uh
working with paul on the with the hplc and
[SPEAKER_07]: he taught me a lot of just how to use it
how to call everything you talked about
[SPEAKER_07]: just put me into memories of looking at
all those different peaks and profiles and
[SPEAKER_07]: all the different strains and and really
chasing those profiles and seeing what was
[SPEAKER_07]: happening with all the different strains
it was interesting to learn that knowledge
[SPEAKER_16]: so thanks for that memory oh well that's
why we had to bring somebody in
[SPEAKER_16]: internationally who made the solutions so
that's why we did that and he taught us
[SPEAKER_16]: how to then suspend it in 100 alcohol and
so we had a standardized methodology right
[SPEAKER_16]: so that we could actually because we were
just going for thc originally remember
[SPEAKER_16]: that's where we started yeah see there's
the old sigma samples because we were
[SPEAKER_16]: looking at that originally and we're like
oh my god and then they wanted to know who
[SPEAKER_16]: we were because this is way before testing
we weren't a lab we're a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_16]: they're like get the fuck out of here with
that shit so that's when we realized when
[SPEAKER_16]: i started asking ethan russo and all the
other experts i was like okay who can i
[SPEAKER_16]: pull to actually test but my question goes
to sam is so you were originally testing
[SPEAKER_16]: for thc i guess originally and then when
did the other cannabinoids start to get
[SPEAKER_05]: added when did you start to add from the
beginning we were we were testing for at
[SPEAKER_05]: least the top 10 cannabinoids so you had
those you had those those standards yes we
[SPEAKER_05]: had them all legally and uh also too we we
had uh more than i think 50 50 more of the
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes and that was you know very early
in the in the late 80s we were doing that
[SPEAKER_16]: because see we had to start with thc and
then when we had thc then we found that
[SPEAKER_16]: secondary spikes you know and then we did
research and found that was cbd but you
[SPEAKER_16]: know we didn't have any of the standards
of cbg cbn you know or any of that so
[SPEAKER_16]: we've had to add that so it's quite
amazing i thought it would have been a
[SPEAKER_16]: step-by-step process but to know that you
had access to them is kind of mind-blowing
[SPEAKER_05]: we just we just bought them all we had
thcb cbc cbg the propyl homologs of all
[SPEAKER_16]: those i mean we we had them all how did
you know to have those and which ones to
[SPEAKER_05]: have versus ones not to have well i didn't
know which ones were which but uh since i
[SPEAKER_05]: had them all i tried them all and uh i i
found out that it was known the hplc
[SPEAKER_13]: characterization of cannabis extract was
discovered was not discovered was reported
[SPEAKER_13]: actually by canadians uh in the early 60s
and so this was actually just prior to
[SPEAKER_13]: mishulam's paper in in 64 on the
structural elucidation so hplc
[SPEAKER_13]: fractionation of the cannabinoids uh was
was known hplc was new wasn't hplc as we
[SPEAKER_13]: know it i mean this is like this is such
such cool because like if you look at if
[SPEAKER_13]: you and you know it's really interesting i
just i wrote an article that i think is
[SPEAKER_13]: being published um on the thing that i
think i've talked about on hash church
[SPEAKER_13]: which is the group from uh england that
first isolated thc in the late 1800 so in
[SPEAKER_13]: 1896 is the first reported isolation by
vacuum distillation of thc distillate and
[SPEAKER_13]: if you uh no not todd no todd what todd
was a contemporary of adams in the 30s no
[SPEAKER_13]: man this is in the 1890s this is wood
spivey and easterfield oh yeah i've got
[SPEAKER_13]: that favor yeah uh yeah we did not commute
did i send you the pre-print that i wrote
[SPEAKER_13]: on this dave i think i sent you one of
their papers you didn't have too yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah okay okay so so so actually if you go
back and it's just it's such a fascinating
[SPEAKER_13]: story the pre-mishulam thc chemistry you
know and and and the way it happened and
[SPEAKER_13]: so this group from from england in fact
one of the guys died i think before the
[SPEAKER_13]: paper actually came out wood spivey and
easterfield still the stuff that they
[SPEAKER_13]: characterized as toxic red oil and they
the way they describe it they describe it
[SPEAKER_13]: just like thc distillate would be you know
it's very sticky and they called it toxic
[SPEAKER_13]: but to them toxic really was just short
for intoxicating it wasn't it wasn't toxic
[SPEAKER_13]: like the way that we think of the word
toxic now it was it was the intoxicating
[SPEAKER_13]: oil the intoxicating fraction and and they
thought it was actually actually
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinol and they did elemental studies
and they called it cannabinol and when you
[SPEAKER_13]: do elemental studies what you're actually
doing is you're actually burning a little
[SPEAKER_13]: bit of the material and when you burn
carbon containing material it goes to
[SPEAKER_13]: carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide right
so from calculate or from calculation how
[SPEAKER_13]: much carbon dioxide and how much carbon
monoxide you measure from the burning of
[SPEAKER_13]: the of the material that you're analyzing
was i mean this is this is 20 years before
[SPEAKER_13]: the discovery of the electron folks okay
this is contemporary with the discovery of
[SPEAKER_13]: the light bulb that these this is like the
1890s okay it tells you how far ahead of
[SPEAKER_13]: time this this science was that these
people were doing so their their elemental
[SPEAKER_13]: formula came really close to cannabinol
but they didn't quite get it but they
[SPEAKER_13]: called it cannabinol on the paper and then
later in the 20s in three or four
[SPEAKER_13]: back-to-back papers in four consecutive
years a british chemist named sydney khan
[SPEAKER_13]: who was actually i think he was an
australian chemist but i think he ended up
[SPEAKER_13]: at a british university figured out the
empirical formula of thc and figured out
[SPEAKER_13]: for the most part the structure and this
is all before todd and adams so this is
[SPEAKER_13]: prior to todd and adams man they had this
shit fucking figured out dude and this is
[SPEAKER_13]: fucking crazy shit so then when todd and
adams came along he's the thing the thing
[SPEAKER_13]: that that messed up i think it was more
adams than todd because adams in uh in two
[SPEAKER_13]: years published about 30 papers on his
isolation of cbd and thc and what he
[SPEAKER_13]: thought their structures what were and
remind yourself that they didn't have hplc
[SPEAKER_13]: they didn't have nmr they didn't have all
the modern methods of instrumentation that
[SPEAKER_13]: the later chemists that follow like
michelin and myself have so it's just it's
[SPEAKER_13]: just so great for us now to be able to
understand that history and understand
[SPEAKER_13]: where all that this stuff came from and so
this is way before michelin and so so it
[SPEAKER_13]: what complicated adams's assignment was in
as we know there's a uh a configuration of
[SPEAKER_13]: the double bond and thc called delta 9 and
if given the opportunity delta 9 undergoes
[SPEAKER_13]: what's called an isomerization over to
delta 8 and delta 8 we hear a lot about of
[SPEAKER_13]: today because there's a lot of people who
are using um michelin chemistry to convert
[SPEAKER_13]: cbd over to delta 8 because delta 8 is the
thermodynamic resting spot for that double
[SPEAKER_13]: bond you know when you're looking at the
chemical structure of thc it looks like
[SPEAKER_13]: chicken wire you know there's kind of like
in that north piece of chicken wire
[SPEAKER_13]: there's kind of like a double bond and
where that double bond resides is is
[SPEAKER_13]: whether or not it's delta 9 or delta 8 and
if given the opportunity it likes to get
[SPEAKER_13]: away from the benzene ring so it likes to
move from delta 9 to delta 8 it's favored
[SPEAKER_05]: just on an energy profile by itself so so
mark that when you find archaeological
[SPEAKER_05]: remains that were high thc or even
moderate thc it's often found as delta 8
[SPEAKER_05]: because the delta 9 is gone or converted
and the delta 8 sticks around yeah i i've
[SPEAKER_13]: described it before on hash church go back
and do our homework as kind of like a
[SPEAKER_13]: roller coaster right and and like delta
delta 9 is at the top of the hill but
[SPEAKER_13]: delta 8 is at the bottom of the hill and
once delta 9 goes to delta 8 it doesn't go
[SPEAKER_13]: back it's like it's the it's the more
thermodynamically favored resting point
[SPEAKER_13]: and and your observation there sam totally
speaks to that so so anyway and again
[SPEAKER_13]: delta 8 and delta 9 by most uh hplc
methods can be separated so you can
[SPEAKER_13]: separate and you can distinguish between
those two isomers there's a lot of talk
[SPEAKER_13]: about this online because there's concern
about hemp derived delta 8 on its quasi
[SPEAKER_13]: legality on and that's a whole different
uh ball of wax but to just go back to the
[SPEAKER_13]: machulam story and the and and and adams
is if you go back and look at adams's work
[SPEAKER_13]: it's all he doesn't know where that double
bond is and so he puts it i think in the
[SPEAKER_13]: nine position but i think his methyl
assignment was wrong or they just didn't
[SPEAKER_13]: have all the structural data that you know
machulam and and others had later in the
[SPEAKER_13]: 60s after nmr was invented and then when
hplc was invented i think right away like
[SPEAKER_13]: right after there were commercial systems
the paper i have in fact marcus i believe
[SPEAKER_13]: we talked about this on hash church too
because it was a group of canadians that
[SPEAKER_13]: did it um uh first characterized the hplc
separation of the cannabinoids and i
[SPEAKER_13]: believe the terpenes on of of of cannabis
i think that was a Canadian group that did
[SPEAKER_05]: that when did gc start being used mark do
you know yeah and then gc was around the
[SPEAKER_13]: same time so it was important for like all
these chromatographic methods that they
[SPEAKER_13]: actually have the the the packing
materials and so what made hplc work was
[SPEAKER_13]: the column what makes the column work is
the stuff that goes inside the column well
[SPEAKER_13]: check it out that was invented by a guy
named jack kirkland who i actually had the
[SPEAKER_13]: unbelievable honor of meeting at one point
um jack used to work at dupont many many
[SPEAKER_13]: years ago and he left when they splintered
off uh hewlett packard which became now
[SPEAKER_13]: adulant and he was a kind old guy i mean
really nice guy but um they they invented
[SPEAKER_13]: macropora silica which was required in
order to make the packing material for
[SPEAKER_13]: these columns and that enabled the whole
hplc thing to exist and when they did that
[SPEAKER_13]: for gc so gas chromatography rather than
dissolving the material what you're doing
[SPEAKER_13]: is you're again going through that
elaborate sampling process where you're
[SPEAKER_13]: weighing out the sample you know exactly
what it is and then what you're doing is
[SPEAKER_13]: you're you're injecting it into a uh
injection port which is a very hot um uh
[SPEAKER_13]: plate and on that hot metal plate when
your sample hits it it's instantly
[SPEAKER_13]: vaporized and and and that vapor now
travels through the column and so rather
[SPEAKER_13]: than a solution traveling through the
column and separating things based on
[SPEAKER_13]: polarity in the gc what you're doing is
you're basing things uh separation on
[SPEAKER_13]: differences in boiling points and so your
your your most volatile components are
[SPEAKER_13]: going to come out first right so as they
percolate through the column your terpenes
[SPEAKER_13]: come out and then your cannabinoids come
out later because they're your higher
[SPEAKER_13]: boiling stuff because gas chromatography
is based on separation based on uh boiling
[SPEAKER_13]: through the column which is basically just
kind of like a maze that the compounds
[SPEAKER_13]: have to get through and then like hplc
there's a detector on the other side of
[SPEAKER_13]: that column that lights up and makes a
peak every time a compound comes down whoo
[SPEAKER_13]: that's a lot we went through gc and hplc
that was a lot but very well said and
[SPEAKER_03]: people appreciate that that is uh that's
good information on a sunday morning it's
[SPEAKER_13]: cool because you know i'm getting a lot of
inquiries mark people go back and they
[SPEAKER_13]: watch hash church and they want to know
about like things like this i'm going to
[SPEAKER_13]: reference this church just because people
will know it oh what is hplc or what is
[SPEAKER_13]: you know what i've had to say that is
really important for measuring your
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoids and gc is really important
for measuring your terpenes and the thing
[SPEAKER_13]: about gc remember you're squirting it onto
that hot plate on that hot plate
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoid decarboxylation happens
instantaneously so you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_13]: a measurement of your cannabinoid uh
profiles in terms of what you're going to
[SPEAKER_13]: see in your in your hplc because in your
hplc you don't see decarboxylation so i'll
[SPEAKER_03]: add it in the comment section as well mark
so when people come back and what was that
[SPEAKER_03]: i said i'll add it in the in the comment
section that you mentioned that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: what you you know the breakdown between
the differences and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_07]: history are there any questions class i'm
going to say mark when i had that gc in my
[SPEAKER_07]: garage i found that a lot easier to use
than the hplc was a lot more technical a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot more prep work a lot more time where
just putting it in the side and heating it
[SPEAKER_07]: up and putting it into the machine itself
um well again there's two types of
[SPEAKER_13]: analysis there's qualitative analysis
where you're looking to qualitative
[SPEAKER_13]: something and then there's something
called quantitative analysis where you're
[SPEAKER_13]: just looking to find out how much of
something is in there and sometimes just a
[SPEAKER_13]: yes or no decision you know you want to
just get a quick shoot on the gc and you
[SPEAKER_13]: want to just see your big thc peak and
maybe a couple other peaks and that's fine
[SPEAKER_13]: and dandy but if you need to correlate it
or measure it and especially measure it
[SPEAKER_13]: because now you're going to take that
stuff and put it into say i don't know mct
[SPEAKER_13]: or you're going to make some type of
product that has to be dosed at a
[SPEAKER_13]: particular label concentration i don't
know how you do that without having hplc
[SPEAKER_14]: in internally you know mark uh question
about uh things like orange photonics uh
[SPEAKER_14]: these i can't remember there's a few other
um different yeah the products like this
[SPEAKER_14]: that you know we i dreamed of walking into
my hemp fields and just like plopping it
[SPEAKER_14]: down and being like yeah let's go grab all
these samples how realistic is a lot of
[SPEAKER_13]: this stuff um it's not that they're not
accurate they can only give you a level of
[SPEAKER_13]: precision and that that's good for you
know if you're making a decision on
[SPEAKER_13]: whether or not to take a crop out of the
field you could probably use one of those
[SPEAKER_13]: but you can't use that to basically use
those numbers in say like the dosing of a
[SPEAKER_13]: product to meet a label requirement no way
because you're just not going to have the
[SPEAKER_13]: level of accuracy it's plus or minus two
or three percent that just doesn't you
[SPEAKER_13]: know like i said that's not even ballpark
that's exit that the ballpark results yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: i don't find them very accurate at all we
did all of our lab work for both gc and
[SPEAKER_05]: hplc because we had both we always had to
first dehumidify the sample down to almost
[SPEAKER_05]: zero humidity moisture and so if you don't
if you don't have it together you don't
[SPEAKER_13]: have it together yeah i mean i mean you
bring up a great point sam and this is
[SPEAKER_13]: probably again a potential source of that
of that 101 percent error that you're
[SPEAKER_13]: seeing which is that if you're not drying
the material and and there could be water
[SPEAKER_13]: there as we know you know biomass and uh
there's alec okay we get the authority in
[SPEAKER_13]: here to tell us about it so it's this this
sample that just you're aware is what's
[SPEAKER_13]: called hygroscopic which means it'll
absorb moisture from the air and certainly
[SPEAKER_13]: like if you take biomaterial that's been
dried and you reintroduce it to a moist
[SPEAKER_13]: ambient moisture environment it's going to
dry in moisture and that's going to affect
[SPEAKER_13]: the weight of what you're trying to
measure down to the hundredth of a
[SPEAKER_13]: milligram and if you're really trying to
be really really really really really
[SPEAKER_13]: accurate it has to be dried to the point
of zero water every time every time every
[SPEAKER_13]: time and if it's not yeah you're you're
gonna have a little bit of squish in your
[SPEAKER_14]: data so that material was bone dry it was
just straight thca you know mechanically
[SPEAKER_14]: separated i mean you're talking long
presses i mean exorbitant right send me a
[SPEAKER_14]: sample i would but yeah i i appreciate
your insight on on that i i think the fed
[SPEAKER_13]: has something bigger on their mind these
days it does things to my head when i put
[SPEAKER_14]: that into the market and i have to put
that on the label but here's the thing
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah you know like like with thca i mean
this is this is just a real kind of cool
[SPEAKER_13]: thing so you could melt thca at a lower
temperature below which it decarboxylates
[SPEAKER_13]: at so think think about that for a second
you could melt thca into a liquid before
[SPEAKER_13]: it'll decarboxylate so if you have a
melting point apparatus that's a wonderful
[SPEAKER_13]: wonderful way to see how pure your sample
is right and in fact you know you can in
[SPEAKER_13]: my melting point apparatus i could do side
by side samples you know where you can do
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe another recrystallization or
multiple recrystallizations try to
[SPEAKER_13]: recrystallize that stuff to 99.9999
percent and do side by side melting points
[SPEAKER_13]: and see how sharp your melting point is
and sounds like you need to do my testing
[SPEAKER_13]: melting point apparatus are pretty cheap
and and i think you can buy them i don't
[SPEAKER_13]: think they're that expensive but it's a
great indication for crystals like cbd
[SPEAKER_13]: isolate on on purity yeah it's kind of
like poor man's hplc just to tell you how
[SPEAKER_03]: pure your stuff is hey welcome to alec mr
alec must have heard us chatting i don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know if he's still there i see a blank
blank uh spot where his camera was but uh
[SPEAKER_03]: he definitely was here for a bit we'll
give him a welcome he connected
[SPEAKER_03]: telepathically right that's it he did he
just he felt his ears burning he was like
[SPEAKER_16]: i think those guys and they're doing the
testing the emerald cup so you know he's
[SPEAKER_03]: the authority right remember the day he
came on hash church and he was like he had
[SPEAKER_03]: just done the emerald cup and he's like i
kind of feel like the grinch who stole
[SPEAKER_16]: christmas because we could see through the
talk and the lies there is he's moving
[SPEAKER_16]: around again you know because now we had
real science to see through the the
[SPEAKER_16]: bullshit and the hearsay and the
conjecture you know science and it and
[SPEAKER_16]: yeah alec felt bad because he kicked a
whole bunch of people in the groin because
[SPEAKER_16]: they all fucking used you know pesticides
and things they should have been used and
[SPEAKER_16]: they got caught so it just was surprising
i think the amount of numbers that you
[SPEAKER_16]: know alec and them founded sc labs you
know that uh people thought that they
[SPEAKER_16]: could get away with so you know shame on
those people for trying to compete with
[SPEAKER_16]: tainted product and good on alec and them
for actually catching them using real
[SPEAKER_13]: science well i don't know that i don't
know how widespread that issue in in water
[SPEAKER_13]: hash was really known right i mean mark i
mean we we talked about it on hash church
[SPEAKER_13]: and at the time i did a little poking
around on the internet but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_13]: universally known that if your cakes
aren't fucking dry they're gonna start
[SPEAKER_13]: molding within hours right i mean this is
just like a biological process that you
[SPEAKER_13]: just cannot stop and you need to keep your
shit dry right i mean now that happened i
[SPEAKER_13]: think in or frozen but but didn't that
that whole revelation wasn't known in the
[SPEAKER_03]: hash community was it well it kind of got
learned this way first you know there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot you know i'm not going to go over the
entire history but at a time where i was
[SPEAKER_03]: doing this let's just say there was almost
nobody online on the internet promoting
[SPEAKER_03]: this process and i made a massive mistake
i made the mistake that i would take the
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble especially here in the pacific
northwest and i would end up you know
[SPEAKER_03]: leave it in patties let it so you think
it's dry but then it's really not dry you
[SPEAKER_03]: roll it into balls you get this really
beautiful marble but if you're getting
[SPEAKER_03]: that marble that always told me you know
that hash is not dry yet it's gone through
[SPEAKER_03]: stages of drying and then you're breaking
it open releasing the lighter color to the
[SPEAKER_03]: darker on the outside and mixing it all up
into a marble and what happened with an
[SPEAKER_03]: enormous amount of the the earliest water
hashes made from bubble bags at least from
[SPEAKER_03]: 1999 and and and upwards till about 2003
or four we weren't drying the hash
[SPEAKER_03]: properly it just wasn't being dried so it
would do this buttering thing where it
[SPEAKER_03]: would just start to kind of fall apart and
when you crack open a ball and smell it
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd have that funky smell where you were
like there's something not right going on
[SPEAKER_03]: in that hash like that's a guarantee not
right that took me years of promoting
[SPEAKER_03]: sieving and micro planning and trying to
show people like don't put don't put it
[SPEAKER_03]: into a pile don't put it you know then
people like nick and t came out was like
[SPEAKER_03]: oh you can dry hash in like a day a day
and a half but not really going over the
[SPEAKER_03]: fact that he was in colorado in this in
this dry arid place versus the pacific
[SPEAKER_03]: northwest if you're telling someone over
and vice versa you know for me to be
[SPEAKER_03]: telling him hey it's going to take you at
least seven days to dry your hash my god
[SPEAKER_03]: it would have no turps left in it so we
learned things like that by being
[SPEAKER_03]: different people promoting these similar
things in different places we learned that
[SPEAKER_03]: the hash acts differently and went which
you mentioned earlier in regards to
[SPEAKER_03]: hydrophilic when the hash is sitting out
and there's tons of moisture in the air
[SPEAKER_03]: trust me it's never going to dry it'll
literally get more wet by pulling that
[SPEAKER_03]: shit out of the out of the air so that's
where the desiccant came into play and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's why i always wanted people to dry
on something like a food grade thick
[SPEAKER_03]: cardboard before freeze dryers something
for home use that didn't cost thousands of
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars people were already bitching about
the cost of bubble bags this was 22 years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago and they were a couple hundred bucks
for a pair so they certainly weren't going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be going out and buying a eight
thousand dollar freeze dryer to uh you
[SPEAKER_03]: know to take this to that level it was for
personal and if you did it right you could
[SPEAKER_03]: get the hash dry in the pacific northwest
without using a desiccant it was very very
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult grading it or sieving it very
very thin so it wasn't piled up and
[SPEAKER_03]: holding you know itself inside itself
again sealing up that hash because it
[SPEAKER_03]: would do that even freshly sieved so you
know these are definitely things that um
[SPEAKER_13]: we learned the point that i was making and
i think alec is is here now and maybe he
[SPEAKER_13]: can comment is that i think our discussion
about this on hash church with the data
[SPEAKER_13]: that alec presented and this whole
awareness now i i think was a outcrop of
[SPEAKER_13]: that of of that episode that atn was
talking about which is that you know i
[SPEAKER_13]: hate to give you the bad news but you know
um so totally is that right i mean is that
[SPEAKER_13]: the first time that data that supported um
microbial contamination of improperly
[SPEAKER_13]: dried hash is a widespread phenomena
[SPEAKER_11]: i apologize for that was that uh for a
question to me yeah yeah well so so yeah i
[SPEAKER_11]: mean uh it's been very fascinating i think
i feel like through through um you know
[SPEAKER_11]: incredible kind of vehicles like hash
church you know i definitely feel as
[SPEAKER_11]: though it kind of helped to push kind of
forward a lot of the consciousness and
[SPEAKER_11]: understanding of these these kind of
shortfalls in or pitfalls with certain
[SPEAKER_11]: types of extraction whether you know kind
of you know microbial kind of overgrowth
[SPEAKER_11]: is a particular because of the presence of
moisture or or in the case of pesticides
[SPEAKER_11]: the way kind of pesticides carry over and
concentrate in extraction processes
[SPEAKER_11]: especially ones that aren't necessarily
water soluble but um yeah i mean i
[SPEAKER_11]: definitely dig up past church just
understanding how many people kind of uh
[SPEAKER_11]: that are passionate enthusiasts of this
plant and of of perfecting that have kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of gained and learned from this this uh
this avenue um but yeah i mean but but but
[SPEAKER_11]: mark i because i i tuned into the the live
uh youtube and i heard you talking about
[SPEAKER_11]: hbl cgc and and you have so much respect
to you i mean i'm not in any way i mean
[SPEAKER_11]: i'm one of the co-founders of sc labs i'm
not a scientist myself i'm kind of more
[SPEAKER_11]: from you know the cultivation kind of
cannabis side of um you know front-facing
[SPEAKER_11]: side of our business but uh i you know i'd
like to think and become a trained
[SPEAKER_11]: parakeet and being able to you know at
least grasp understand talk and convey you
[SPEAKER_11]: know some high scientific kind of
perspectives and understandings that you
[SPEAKER_11]: know i've come to learn and we've come to
learn from trends you know from testing
[SPEAKER_13]: over the last decade yeah totally i mean i
i think that you know i mean you mentioned
[SPEAKER_13]: hash church and before we were talking
about kind of like the grateful dead scene
[SPEAKER_13]: and the like to me man i mean how how
lucky are we to live when we did we
[SPEAKER_13]: traversed a millennium okay we were born
in another millennium and and and we were
[SPEAKER_13]: alive during during miles davis we were
alive during bob marley i was i saw jerry
[SPEAKER_13]: garcia in a building i think what almost
200 times it's just to me it's like we we
[SPEAKER_13]: we have a really unique opportunity to
really bring together this you know
[SPEAKER_13]: passion that all of us have for the plant
and people who really love you know where
[SPEAKER_13]: this industry is going when i say industry
yeah there's a lot of things that i don't
[SPEAKER_13]: like about it because there's like suits
and ties and money and having to raise
[SPEAKER_13]: tons of money but you know on the other
side of that you have an industry that has
[SPEAKER_13]: standardized testing you have people
understand that hplc is not just something
[SPEAKER_13]: that you're paying for at the testing lab
but i have to have that at my production
[SPEAKER_13]: facility too because how the hell do i
know what i'm making if i'm making
[SPEAKER_13]: extracts that i i don't do any internal
testing before so we we use third-party
[SPEAKER_13]: testing all the time and it's always to
validate things that we've already tested
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 ways between now and last sunday we
know what that results going to come back
[SPEAKER_13]: when we send it over defense the
third-party lab because we've already
[SPEAKER_13]: tested it a whole bunch of times and we're
making sure that a tincture bottle or
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever i mean the right label
information is coherent with you know
[SPEAKER_13]: again every best you know analytical
method that we have now we do have the
[SPEAKER_13]: luxury of standing on the shoulders of
these giants that came before us and as
[SPEAKER_13]: you look at you know all the cannabinoid
chemistry literature which is rich with
[SPEAKER_13]: just discovery discovery made in an
environment with incredible headwinds
[SPEAKER_13]: where you can't do research on this plant
you know and still people did research
[SPEAKER_13]: because they knew how important this plant
was and it happened in other places other
[SPEAKER_13]: than the united states because of it and
and that's fine i mean the chemical
[SPEAKER_13]: literature for a scientist like me is my
crystal ball right and i could look into
[SPEAKER_13]: that crystal ball and i could see i could
see what can be and and only i because my
[SPEAKER_13]: eyes grew up i mean i used to play with
legos when i was a kid right and that like
[SPEAKER_13]: star wars legos and these were just the
the blocks here's just a bunch of red and
[SPEAKER_13]: green and blue box there were no no
directions and i think non-linear thought
[SPEAKER_13]: and how kids are able to really put
together in a non-linear way things helps
[SPEAKER_13]: people understand you know that you know
we're just part of this continuum you know
[SPEAKER_13]: and we're all lucky to be alive right now
because man we're the plant is right now
[SPEAKER_13]: and we're at the brink of a new
administration that's going to get in
[SPEAKER_13]: there and change a lot of the laws that
are wrong and still we need to be
[SPEAKER_13]: proactive and i'm sure atm will agree with
me that there's still a lot of things that
[SPEAKER_13]: are wrong that need to be fixed you know
we need to be able to get records expunged
[SPEAKER_13]: we need to be able to get away from this
all the things that prohibition did to
[SPEAKER_13]: drag down our society and to me it's like
the grateful dead was this thing that was
[SPEAKER_13]: going along and that was just gonna again
eventually expel its fruits into something
[SPEAKER_13]: that was going to be bigger than it ever
imagined it would be and that's where
[SPEAKER_03]: we're at so are you saying are you saying
you don't play with star wars lego anymore
[SPEAKER_13]: no i'm just saying that the legos that my
kids grew up playing with were different
[SPEAKER_13]: than the legos that i had when i was a kid
right i mean we were lucky to have the
[SPEAKER_13]: legos where i can put two little rubber
tires and a wheel in there you know hey
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys uh my dad just walked in the door
so thanks very much and i've had such a
[SPEAKER_07]: great morning talking with you all keep
hashing and i will see you guys all again
[SPEAKER_11]: on the next church love you johnny b see
you later johnny b and and i'd love to i'd
[SPEAKER_11]: love to build on a part of marcus's uh or
i'm sorry uh um yes like dr mark's uh
[SPEAKER_11]: points he was just making um you know
that's one of the most fascinating things
[SPEAKER_11]: and i mean i i described it kind of in an
effort kind of across uh different
[SPEAKER_11]: episodes of house church that i've been
able to be part of but you know just
[SPEAKER_11]: learning from the data you know the trends
in the data over hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_11]: data points over the last 10 years you
know it's it's really so much brought me
[SPEAKER_11]: such excitement and optimism about where
this is going although there's all these
[SPEAKER_11]: efforts and corporate predator capitalism
trying to come in to try to pillage and
[SPEAKER_11]: you know kind of take advantage of this
plan to profit on this plant but there's
[SPEAKER_11]: so many built-in teachings and lessons
that you either have learned or you have
[SPEAKER_11]: not even you don't even fucking have a
clue you know excuse my language but you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of you know in service to this
plant in various methods of hash
[SPEAKER_11]: extraction i mean there's so much to learn
and and and you know kind of if you've you
[SPEAKER_11]: know just using cultivation as examples if
you've never gotten hit by broad mites and
[SPEAKER_11]: spider mites and white aphids and white
flies and you know all the potential pests
[SPEAKER_11]: how do you know how to deal with it and so
i just feel like there's this built-in
[SPEAKER_11]: like tribal knowledge and awareness that
that's those that have been in service of
[SPEAKER_11]: plant for so long have that is actually a
massive competitive advantage in the in
[SPEAKER_11]: the coming global regulated market
especially you know and and and on this
[SPEAKER_11]: idea of how do we you know kind of as
thought leaders in the community really
[SPEAKER_11]: help drive you know kind of the way this
is all shaped up you know because in
[SPEAKER_11]: california you know we're seeing so many
efforts uh you know to kind of just
[SPEAKER_11]: monocrop and just blow the this plant up
but you know i feel like the level of
[SPEAKER_11]: hubris that people come into this plant
with thinking they're just going to throw
[SPEAKER_11]: money at it and kind of just crush
everybody is proportional to how quickly
[SPEAKER_11]: face plant you know off the starting line
you know and you know just i'm just
[SPEAKER_11]: witnessing everybody invest so much money
into the worst spaces in the state to grow
[SPEAKER_11]: that are just right in the deepest heart
of you know the ag the industrial ag kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of legacy and and you know in areas like
salinas which you know i'm in santa cruz
[SPEAKER_11]: california and you know salinas is you
know kind of a 45 minute drive salinas you
[SPEAKER_11]: know and that area is you know the the
salad bowl of the united states you know
[SPEAKER_11]: like 70 80 plus percent of the you know
vegetables and produce kind of produced
[SPEAKER_11]: out of that area and so whenever you have
cultivation kind of happening in the in
[SPEAKER_11]: the heart of these areas you know it's
like that area particularly you know it's
[SPEAKER_11]: not just one crop that they're growing
like almonds where there's a set regimen
[SPEAKER_11]: of organophosphates and pesticides and
fungicides they spray each year it's a
[SPEAKER_11]: rotation of all these different crops from
brassicas to greens to kind of you know in
[SPEAKER_11]: each crop planted throughout different
times of the year sprayed with different
[SPEAKER_11]: levels of pesticides and fungicides and so
i feel like you know just uh on that idea
[SPEAKER_11]: you were talking about mark with the you
know the the crystal ball you know from
[SPEAKER_11]: the data i almost feel the same thing i
almost see like this future sports almanac
[SPEAKER_11]: of you know just seeing who are you know
coming potential winners and losers of
[SPEAKER_11]: where it's going and and um you know just
i feel like as long as you know we have
[SPEAKER_11]: this eternal vigilance to kind of not have
things kind of be deregulated or allow the
[SPEAKER_11]: deregulation of this you know because they
put in so much regulation and i think
[SPEAKER_11]: there's yeah tons of it tax aid and all
kinds of stuff that is um incredibly
[SPEAKER_11]: important that we work to kind of reform
and change but you know with regard to the
[SPEAKER_11]: testing regulations you know i feel like
um it's a it's a barrier of entry it's a
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a leveling of the playing field you
know you know once this goes national you
[SPEAKER_11]: know you can't just plant 180 acres of of
cannabis in the middle of the you know in
[SPEAKER_11]: the middle of the heartland of agriculture
like the the millions of acres of uh the
[SPEAKER_11]: of dust bowl across the midwest you know
it's because that has there's massive fire
[SPEAKER_11]: remediation fire remediation has to occur
you know before there can be any potential
[SPEAKER_11]: to grow cannabis that's going to compete
on a national market that's going to pass
[SPEAKER_11]: and be able to you know be made available
to the public you know with these levels
[SPEAKER_11]: of public health safety standards sorry go
ahead mark what i see alex i mean i think
[SPEAKER_13]: these are all great points i think colin
might be able to comment on this too as
[SPEAKER_13]: well as as programs open up out in the
eastern united states out in the states
[SPEAKER_13]: this side in mississippi is that i think
they recognize the importance of the
[SPEAKER_13]: testing industry has to kind of like be a
sister industry to the to the production
[SPEAKER_13]: industry itself meaning that they need to
have two sets of businesses in the state
[SPEAKER_13]: they need to have the producers the people
who are growing extracting making
[SPEAKER_13]: formulated products and dispensing those
products but we also need to have
[SPEAKER_13]: third-party independent testing lab that
needs to be completely different set of
[SPEAKER_13]: people doing those business operations and
not the same set of people you know and i
[SPEAKER_13]: think there's always a confusion i think
that people always have about testing that
[SPEAKER_13]: it's somehow it's some panacea and some
it's some box oh well they'll they'll test
[SPEAKER_13]: it everything will be tested it's like
again i think that it's really naive to
[SPEAKER_13]: even open up uh producing production
facility where you're going to be spending
[SPEAKER_13]: you know hundreds of thousands if not
millions of dollars uh to put into
[SPEAKER_13]: developing a licensed production facility
without having internal analytics and if
[SPEAKER_13]: you don't have internal analytics and
you're just going to send all your stuff
[SPEAKER_13]: over the fence well then you're going to
have prohibitively long production
[SPEAKER_13]: timelines because in order to formulate
your distillate you need to know what your
[SPEAKER_13]: distillate tests at so what are you going
to do test your distillate then wait
[SPEAKER_13]: around 10 days for that result to come
back before you formulate the distillate
[SPEAKER_13]: no you want to test it right down in there
and and have testing capabilities all
[SPEAKER_13]: throughout the selection of your biomass
you know you don't just take a coa from
[SPEAKER_13]: some farm you should be testing the
biomass yourself any type of whether
[SPEAKER_13]: you're buying crude or whether you're
buying distillate or whether you're buying
[SPEAKER_13]: any process intermediate yeah it's going
to show up with the coa but wouldn't it be
[SPEAKER_13]: great to do the testing yourself and what
we found i mean this is interesting alec
[SPEAKER_13]: because again i don't usually say this
with a lot of people is that some testing
[SPEAKER_13]: labs are again they're in this high
throughput mode and they're just sort of
[SPEAKER_13]: like you know grinding out never failing
yeah totally yeah so you know how you run
[SPEAKER_13]: your hplc is kind of like how you drive
your car in a way well and and if i'm real
[SPEAKER_11]: quick and i apologize colin i think you're
about to jump in but just i'd love to make
[SPEAKER_11]: a point real quick because you know that's
another thing we're seeing from california
[SPEAKER_11]: and and some of the leadership that the
way california you know regulated the test
[SPEAKER_13]: or just as far as testing goes because let
me just finish my car analogy i think it's
[SPEAKER_13]: funny so how you drive your car is how you
run your hplc so if there's a road with a
[SPEAKER_13]: bunch of potholes in it you ever drive
down it really fast and you hardly hit any
[SPEAKER_13]: potholes at all right because you drive
down so fast that you never hit any of
[SPEAKER_13]: them but when you drive really slow you
get every fucking pot hole right that's my
[SPEAKER_14]: it's a beautiful analogy mark it's like
having this awesome instrument here and
[SPEAKER_14]: not being able to know what it sounds like
you know what i mean i'm like it just it
[SPEAKER_14]: looks so good and it's i know i'm what i'm
playing i know i'm playing the right
[SPEAKER_14]: chords and the right in the right key and
i know exactly what's what's i think
[SPEAKER_14]: what's happening but you're missing that
call and response that um as a formulator
[SPEAKER_14]: as a product developer and a hash maker i
i just i yearn for that immediacy because
[SPEAKER_14]: that to me is the art and that call and
response is necessary for myself to really
[SPEAKER_14]: make decision making that's actually
educated rather than waiting around i wait
[SPEAKER_14]: around i mean i've waited waited long
times got like months to just be like well
[SPEAKER_14]: where's the sample this is just been
sitting on ice for me essentially it's a
[SPEAKER_14]: hurry up and wait situation in the
regulated market sometimes and it's it
[SPEAKER_14]: becomes actually frustrating i think into
your point mark yeah if you're constantly
[SPEAKER_14]: throwing things over the over the fence
you're just it's uh you're at the mercy of
[SPEAKER_11]: of them so yeah and yeah it's really no i
couldn't agree more i and i apologize for
[SPEAKER_11]: any interruption there no don't don't be
never apologize i i appreciate i
[SPEAKER_11]: appreciate these these points you know and
you know i think so much of the foundation
[SPEAKER_11]: though is quality analytics and and to
actually do the work to learn how to drive
[SPEAKER_11]: um or to to play that instrument you know
and and uh and one day i was going to hit
[SPEAKER_11]: on two points one around kind of internal
testing and then the other one on kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: third-party testing because you know if
you're going to put people through so much
[SPEAKER_11]: regulations and burden some testing you
know for third-party certification to
[SPEAKER_11]: ensure public health and safety you know
you have to be overly regulating the
[SPEAKER_11]: analytical labs during the testing because
if you don't have you know substantial
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of auditing and ongoing data package
review processes from the regulating body
[SPEAKER_11]: on the labs doing the testing you know
then then there's no point in even having
[SPEAKER_11]: testing regulations on people because if
labs aren't held to a certain standard and
[SPEAKER_11]: you know they can just you know and people
you know there there becomes an economic
[SPEAKER_11]: disadvantage to work with good labs for
good reasons of accuracy and precision you
[SPEAKER_11]: know to more taste how high thc numbers or
to just always go through these labs
[SPEAKER_11]: because they would pass you know but you
know kind of as an example just with terpy
[SPEAKER_11]: testing you know um whenever we run a
terpy test or a gc you know we go we go
[SPEAKER_11]: you know the runtime through our column is
about 90 minutes per sample you know so
[SPEAKER_11]: that we can ensure that there's full
separation for every individual peak
[SPEAKER_11]: because if you if you if you rush it and
you have the 15 minute runtime because
[SPEAKER_11]: you're trying to do this high throughput
thing then you can see it in the data
[SPEAKER_11]: being completely wrong because of the
identity misidentification of co-eluting
[SPEAKER_11]: compounds that you know you identify as
eucalyptol or something that's not even
[SPEAKER_11]: ever showing up in any substantial amount
in cannabis and so i think you know the
[SPEAKER_11]: foundation of good chemistry good science
good analytical chemistry is is is doing
[SPEAKER_11]: the work and validation to ensure that
you're actually test identifying what
[SPEAKER_11]: you're looking to test you know and and
you know i completely agree i think i
[SPEAKER_11]: think the partnership between you know um
third party labs like ourselves and and
[SPEAKER_11]: those that are in cultivation or
manufacturing is you know especially as as
[SPEAKER_11]: groups are bringing on their own internal
hplc and gc capabilities it's to develop
[SPEAKER_11]: that relationship and partnership and
helping to you know ensure you know show
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're you know same page third party
testing labs but also individual groups
[SPEAKER_11]: setting up labs because you know if you're
formulating off of a bad method um you
[SPEAKER_11]: know then then you're then you know
there's no ability to be consistent or
[SPEAKER_11]: that's another problem in comparing that
to third party testing yeah like to your
[SPEAKER_14]: point that that you just made right there
the the differentiation from batch to
[SPEAKER_14]: batch or the same batch tested unknowingly
to them or maybe they do know because it's
[SPEAKER_14]: batch number related but they do come back
differently at times and we've addressed
[SPEAKER_14]: that um and yeah i think good things take
time and that's the other half of it is
[SPEAKER_14]: that you're illustrating the the most the
biggest point is it's it's it's i take a
[SPEAKER_14]: lot of time in my craft and and doing what
they're doing in in the lab that's the
[SPEAKER_14]: same way if you cut current corners you're
going to see it in the data and that's
[SPEAKER_14]: you're exactly right and i don't know what
the answer to that stuff is but it's you
[SPEAKER_14]: know i know from my point of view because
of all the ceilings that we are the lower
[SPEAKER_14]: ceilings that we have in the particular
state that i'm in in our facility it's
[SPEAKER_14]: just it it becomes um i just want things
faster i'm just it's only human though i
[SPEAKER_14]: guess you know um so i think it's it's
good that we can push labs to to to think
[SPEAKER_14]: about this but to your point what there's
a give and take um yeah and you know in
[SPEAKER_11]: california for compliance testing you know
we're at two to three days so i mean you
[SPEAKER_11]: shouldn't you should never oh you know be
satisfied with 30 days you know and and
[SPEAKER_14]: wow see i would i would be happy to get
there that would be incredible yeah and
[SPEAKER_11]: and you know it's taken us a long time to
get to that but um you know but but to the
[SPEAKER_11]: quality conversation that's where i think
california you know i think a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: states that we could regulate in the past
haven't taken haven't done their job of
[SPEAKER_11]: regulating labs to the should be and so
what happens in california you know
[SPEAKER_11]: eventually as every lab is fully licensed
no lab that has their full license
[SPEAKER_11]: currently you know every lab that's
currently licensed is operating on
[SPEAKER_11]: provisional license at most and and by the
end of the regulation there's so much
[SPEAKER_11]: ongoing auditing accreditation and and the
bureau cannabis control in california has
[SPEAKER_11]: this process known as data package review
um and so at any time the bcc can reach
[SPEAKER_11]: out to a lab and they come from client
driven complaints on inconsistency and
[SPEAKER_11]: quality or from just random audit but
they'll request a data package it's about
[SPEAKER_11]: 12 gigabytes of data the lab has to get to
them by the end of the following day and
[SPEAKER_11]: so and and it's all the calibration data
quality data who touched it went every
[SPEAKER_11]: aspect of of the of every test that was
done on that batch and then the bcc has a
[SPEAKER_11]: panel of phd analytical chemists that then
essentially grade these data packages and
[SPEAKER_11]: review and you know and and scrutinize
these data packages and if they see any
[SPEAKER_11]: issue with the data they'll reach out to
the lab you have to the end they'll ask
[SPEAKER_11]: you a question and you have to the end of
that day at four in the afternoon to
[SPEAKER_11]: answer that question and based on your
ability to answer the question they'll
[SPEAKER_11]: either say all right cool you're good or
they'll initiate an investigation and so
[SPEAKER_11]: once they initiate investigation they
begin doing deeper dives and auditing you
[SPEAKER_11]: know the lab's quality systems and
different batches of data and from their
[SPEAKER_11]: findings they'll issue a tier two or tier
three violation tier one's like a fix-it
[SPEAKER_11]: ticket tier two is a suspension and and
there's you know i mean lab has been
[SPEAKER_11]: suspended for five six weeks you know
currently in the state of california from
[SPEAKER_11]: this type of uh you know and then you know
and then the top tier violation is a tier
[SPEAKER_11]: three violation and that's like
identifying you know because tier two
[SPEAKER_11]: violation you're suspended until the until
you can demonstrate bcc that you corrected
[SPEAKER_11]: the action that they found a violation in
you know in the quality of the data or in
[SPEAKER_11]: the method development or validation um
you know and and um and then so so tier
[SPEAKER_11]: two is a suspension for however long it
takes to fix underneath the violation and
[SPEAKER_11]: then a tier three violation has happened
to you know probably about 10 labs already
[SPEAKER_11]: in california and that's a full revocation
of the license because they found
[SPEAKER_11]: fraudulence or gross negligence you know
just juicing numbers like you know kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: tweaking their methods to never see
pesticides and whenever the tier three
[SPEAKER_11]: violation happens they essentially do a
consumer level product recall going back
[SPEAKER_11]: to the beginning of the date of the
investigation begin and uh you know
[SPEAKER_11]: there's a few labs in california that
happen to and and the the most horrifying
[SPEAKER_11]: part of it is you know the the producers
and processors and manufacturers of
[SPEAKER_11]: batches are the ones that take the biggest
hit in those cases because they have to go
[SPEAKER_11]: through these product recalls after they
already you know got cashed out you know
[SPEAKER_11]: you know counted on you know you know
invested their money back into their
[SPEAKER_11]: business you know all of a sudden product
recall and so you know we we really pride
[SPEAKER_11]: ourselves in kind of you know we're
working to be a leader in the leader in in
[SPEAKER_11]: the space of what we do um and and and
testing regulations as you know a little
[SPEAKER_11]: spot not just because we're in the
business of testing but as a cultural um
[SPEAKER_11]: you know on a cultural kind of
sociological level you know we see you
[SPEAKER_11]: know testing as a way of leaving the
playing field again back to the other part
[SPEAKER_11]: of the conversation where you know if
everybody is on the same account of held
[SPEAKER_11]: you know there's you know it's david can
complete against goliath and um and then
[SPEAKER_11]: once we're all on the same level of
quality and data you know then then you
[SPEAKER_11]: know we can begin to actually you know
really help people tune their methods and
[SPEAKER_11]: their internal labs and kind of you know
the whole industry can progress um but
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah what's your take on tac uh do do you
mark dr mark and and also you alex uh and
[SPEAKER_14]: everyone here what do you what do you guys
feel uh what do you mean by tac well you
[SPEAKER_14]: know how the market is really looking at
tac as a as a mechanism in in retail um
[SPEAKER_14]: it's the 20 percent club it's the you know
these types of terms that are being that
[SPEAKER_14]: have been historically thrown around you
know what do you think they mean in terms
[SPEAKER_13]: of of science i'm not familiar i've never
heard before at all
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah well i
mean yeah i mean because you know i mean i
[SPEAKER_11]: think that's that's the whole thing i mean
everybody's been so focused hyper focused
[SPEAKER_11]: on thc in regulated markets as the sole
indicator of quality and it's really had
[SPEAKER_11]: an effect on the market in a huge way not
only because bad loud data exists where
[SPEAKER_11]: numbers are just juiced and it just throws
off the whole thing but also because you
[SPEAKER_11]: know i mean when i think tac combined with
total terpene content and the relative
[SPEAKER_11]: ratio is really one of the best numbers
you could ever judge or value weed on
[SPEAKER_11]: right because you could have a you know 30
percent tac total active cannabinoid you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of containing strain but if you
had less if you know you if you dried it
[SPEAKER_11]: and cured it like you know terribly and
you volatilized all your mono terps you
[SPEAKER_11]: could have say less than 0.2 percent total
terpene content so now you got 35 or 30
[SPEAKER_11]: percent total cannabinoids you got less
than 0.2 percent terpenes that's like a 90
[SPEAKER_11]: to 195 to 1 cannabinoid to terpene ratio
and in my opinion that's what really
[SPEAKER_11]: begins to define what biomass is
everybody's using that word in my opinion
[SPEAKER_11]: biomass is when material that has no other
value because the terpenes are gone or
[SPEAKER_11]: it's old or degraded to where then
distilling it is the only real option to
[SPEAKER_11]: capture value from that material whereas
if there's a bunch of terpene content
[SPEAKER_11]: because preservation and ongoing like you
know because you know a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_11]: farming cannabis but not terpenes right
and and you know we see from the time of
[SPEAKER_11]: harvest even if you dry and cure in the
most ideal conditions you know you there's
[SPEAKER_11]: 60 to 80 percent of terpene content lost
you know so i mean if you harvest in the
[SPEAKER_11]: middle of the day versus the night you
know by going to field harvesting in the
[SPEAKER_11]: middle of the heat of the day you smell
terpenes in the air they've volatilized
[SPEAKER_11]: into your nose right and so i think you
know and and and so going back to that
[SPEAKER_11]: analogy right if you had a if you had a
strain that was 15 percent total active
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoids when fortunately in these
regulated licensed legalized markets you
[SPEAKER_11]: know can can have uh deflated value
because they're not above 20 percent right
[SPEAKER_11]: if it was 15 but it had like but if it was
harvest if it was cultivated optimally
[SPEAKER_11]: harvested in the middle of the night
around the full moon um you know dried
[SPEAKER_11]: cured preserved under like ideal
conditions below 60 degrees you know or
[SPEAKER_11]: more whatever you know like the you know
you can see that in the relative ratio of
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoids cannabinoids to terpenes and
so all of a sudden you you could have
[SPEAKER_11]: three and a half to five and a half
percent terpene content in the dried
[SPEAKER_11]: flower relative to 15 percent cannabinoids
that's like a three to one cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: deterrent ratio you know so so all of a
sudden reality of the entourage effect or
[SPEAKER_11]: the ensemble effect and how much the the
effect is going to hit you know because
[SPEAKER_11]: the liming is three percent in versus you
know half a percent right so i think there
[SPEAKER_11]: is something really big there in the
future you know because it's it's it's you
[SPEAKER_11]: know paying less i mean total active
cannabinoids i think is much more
[SPEAKER_11]: important than total you know thc you know
right because what other cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_11]: in there and what amounts right but but
total cannabinoids in relation to total
[SPEAKER_11]: terpene content the relative ratio that's
like that's more of a measure to actually
[SPEAKER_14]: judge so what is your what's a good
measurement for you that you see in terms
[SPEAKER_14]: of terpenes um you know i mean we see like
anything i think because you see so much
[SPEAKER_14]: that's why i'm asking i just i feel like
it's good for the viewers and even myself
[SPEAKER_14]: to you know because we we've arrived in
this regulated market we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: terms and things that are being thrown
around every day and it all amounts to art
[SPEAKER_14]: and commerce to me at least at the end of
the day and how they quantify that is just
[SPEAKER_13]: so it's there's a lot of opinion around it
well uh so we can thank our friends in
[SPEAKER_13]: italy again for helping another piece of
the puzzle become unraveled right so not
[SPEAKER_13]: only did they discover the the the thcp
and the cbdp c7 cannabinoids so they've
[SPEAKER_13]: now discovered the c6 cannabinoids right
and i posted the link in our chat mark is
[SPEAKER_13]: i don't think i can't post it over in the
in the um i can try to do it right now
[SPEAKER_13]: mark i got it if you guys want to put that
in there but so so this is the this is the
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoid structure but rather than
having the c5 tail it's got a c6 tail so
[SPEAKER_13]: it makes sense that you know all of these
things are in the cannabis that we've been
[SPEAKER_13]: smoking for years the c6 the c3 are the
varins the c7 are the p's and the c5s are
[SPEAKER_13]: the ones that we're you know analyzing
routinely but constantly finding that
[SPEAKER_13]: we're not characterizing the full amount
of what we have well you know these are
[SPEAKER_05]: all pieces that are you're saying that
these compounds are affecting the high i
[SPEAKER_05]: doubt it i found it so i didn't say
they're affecting the high who said that i
[SPEAKER_13]: didn't say they're affecting the high oh
okay i misunderstood well good thing
[SPEAKER_13]: because he doesn't agree with that well
well wait wait this group of italians this
[SPEAKER_13]: group of italians did show that the
compounds are active i think in a mouse uh
[SPEAKER_13]: paw pain assay for noceptive uh pain i i
read the paper really quickly but um it's
[SPEAKER_13]: just another again it's fascinating
because as analytical chemistry is
[SPEAKER_13]: happening and as varieties i think if i
remember correctly the name of the variety
[SPEAKER_13]: was the fm2 if you look at the paper in
nature and i think the paper is widely
[SPEAKER_13]: available it's not like you need some
subscription to a journal so all you need
[SPEAKER_13]: to do is click on that link but you'll see
that they have the cbd version and the thc
[SPEAKER_13]: version that they isolated in very very
small quantities but it just again part of
[SPEAKER_13]: what the plant is making the plants making
these compounds it totally makes sense
[SPEAKER_13]: that the biosynthetic pathway exists and
the thing i'll leave everyone with is that
[SPEAKER_13]: now that they've basically been able to
make cannabinoids in yeast they can now
[SPEAKER_13]: genetically engineer a yeast just to make
specifically now this one with the c6 tail
[SPEAKER_13]: or with the c3 tail and then combine them
later on so you know you're not limited by
[SPEAKER_13]: just plant genetics because you know they
know the biochemical mechanisms and how to
[SPEAKER_13]: basically engineer yeast to make these
compounds how valuable do you think that's
[SPEAKER_13]: going to be long term mark oh i think it's
really valuable i think the i yeah it's
[SPEAKER_13]: incredibly valuable these compounds are
incredibly medicinally active and making
[SPEAKER_13]: small subtle changes to the structure
seems to have impact on the biological
[SPEAKER_13]: activity so i think those small subtle
changes to the structure just even if you
[SPEAKER_13]: compare thc to thcv or if you compare the
seed the ones in the cbd a family i mean
[SPEAKER_13]: all of these compounds basically are
active in the same way the question is is
[SPEAKER_13]: what do the subtle changes in the
structures do impact their safety and
[SPEAKER_13]: efficacy and i think for the most part
that's widely unknown so an open field
[SPEAKER_12]: worth study
[SPEAKER_14]: right no absolutely i agree 100 i would
think so i mean more study more study and
[SPEAKER_13]: regulation yeah it does invite all the
corporate aspects of this but it also
[SPEAKER_13]: invites opportunity to uncover incredible
value propositions which is that these
[SPEAKER_13]: molecules which you know the plant has
basically taught us our biological
[SPEAKER_13]: biologically active and oh yeah by the way
they're also safe for humans have all
[SPEAKER_13]: kinds of myriads of biological properties
that are you know we need to discover and
[SPEAKER_13]: exploit in terms of you know manifesting
it for human health and not taking all
[SPEAKER_12]: this pharmaceutical crap that they're
trying to sell us
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah i've been really i've been i've been
really i've been really freaked out about
[SPEAKER_11]: the frank and cannabinoid you know kind of
future idea yeah prevagen what the hell's
[SPEAKER_13]: in prevagen and some ground up jellyfish
there's commercials on it all over tv i
[SPEAKER_13]: see it on the mainly news i see it all
during you know prevagen it's like some
[SPEAKER_13]: you know herbal supplement that old people
are taking and it says it improves their
[SPEAKER_13]: memory i look at these commercials i'm
like why aren't these people smoking the
[SPEAKER_13]: ganja it'll improve their memory what the
fuck they don't they don't want to say
[SPEAKER_03]: goodbye to the anal leakage they get from
their uh pharmaceutical uh but prevagen is
[SPEAKER_13]: totally not fda regulated it's just herbal
flying under the radar of some herbal
[SPEAKER_13]: supplement bullshit with some nice you
know you know whizbang marketing it's
[SPEAKER_13]: snake oil for christ sakes they i mean
again they say i don't know it improves
[SPEAKER_13]: your memory they say a key ingredient is
derived from jellyfish you know so i don't
[SPEAKER_13]: know just wondering you know i'll stick to
lion's mane yeah sure if you send sam some
[SPEAKER_16]: bitcoin i'll get you some yeah but what
about my beaver anus i love my beaver anus
[SPEAKER_11]: i'm really fascinated too with kind of uh
um and you know and i'm curious too sam if
[SPEAKER_11]: you have any thoughts on just uh you know
because you know a lot of in medicinal
[SPEAKER_11]: mushrooms like um you know cordyceps chaga
all the different you know kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: medicinal mushrooms it seems like there's
trite they're triterpenes that are some of
[SPEAKER_11]: the major compounds behind their medicinal
values and so so just this future of uh
[SPEAKER_11]: combining these triterpenes with
cannabinoids you know and and you know
[SPEAKER_11]: whether you know there might be some
interesting unique kind of you know
[SPEAKER_11]: shifting of you know the way that
cannabinoids or these terpenes are binding
[SPEAKER_11]: the receptors or having effects on the
system are you asking me that what you
[SPEAKER_11]: what do what you think about that yes he
is and you better have the answer i hardly
[SPEAKER_05]: know what to say because uh i never did
any real science on you know mushrooms
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis together other than you know
personally enjoying both but uh i i i
[SPEAKER_05]: really don't know what to say i'll go back
to the that are found in mushrooms whereas
[SPEAKER_03]: we should extend them extensively we'll
send you the paper that josh shared last
[SPEAKER_03]: hash church which is did you check it out
no i didn't read it to be honest what
[SPEAKER_03]: paper check it out i think it'll pull you
in it's called traversing the fungal
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenome i'd love to send it to you as
well alec it's a good one again another
[SPEAKER_13]: thing that i think the hippie and grateful
dead culture got right psychedelics is uh
[SPEAKER_13]: a way to deliver your mind uh from the
oppression of what's going on in your life
[SPEAKER_13]: and uh it's useful for uh all kinds of
folks that i know who started going down
[SPEAKER_13]: and doing the ayahuasca down in south
america who claimed that it basically
[SPEAKER_13]: saved their lives that they would not be
alive today if they didn't go down there
[SPEAKER_13]: two or three times a year and have this
experience and the other thing i wanted to
[SPEAKER_13]: say is that man isn't it just great to see
kind of psychedelics follow in the wake of
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis when you look at you know
policies that are being opened up and say
[SPEAKER_13]: like oregon and denver where now you start
basically saying okay you know what yeah
[SPEAKER_13]: everything's gonna turn into a big parking
lot at a grateful dead shop i mean it it
[SPEAKER_13]: just it goes to show you again you know i
i don't know if there is uh you know an
[SPEAKER_13]: equivalent to like religion or what
replaced religion for a lot of people in
[SPEAKER_13]: their life but whatever that experience
was that delivered them and the dudes who
[SPEAKER_13]: were psyched all week they were going to
see the grateful dead friday and had a bag
[SPEAKER_13]: of shrooms and then they ate those shrooms
and then garcia and the boys came on that
[SPEAKER_13]: was like a moment for that guy well that
was the rapture that was that was the true
[SPEAKER_13]: experience of the rapture that that was
the rapture no faith required right right
[SPEAKER_11]: you had delivered that go ahead alec i so
much love and appreciate uh appreciate
[SPEAKER_11]: where this is going um so for one there's
a book that you should check out if you
[SPEAKER_11]: haven't it's called is it the the
immortality key immortality key yep
[SPEAKER_11]: immortality key it's about yeah yeah
whatever set same page yeah yeah it's
[SPEAKER_11]: about the the root of so much uh religion
dude it's exactly what i was thinking yeah
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah that's awesome and and uh and because
the other part of you know especially over
[SPEAKER_11]: this last year in 2020 is just such a
crazy heavy year you know so you know and
[SPEAKER_11]: the fear is thick you know and the mental
coronaviruses like oh
[SPEAKER_11]: so um yeah so you know everybody's been
freaking out like we're in the apocalypse
[SPEAKER_11]: right and if you if you look at the
definition of the word apocalypse it's the
[SPEAKER_11]: time of revelation or the great unveiling
and and on that idea time of revelation of
[SPEAKER_11]: good unveiling it kind of feels like we're
in that right now you know it feels like
[SPEAKER_11]: and and and and i'm mark i'd love what
you're talking about with uh cannabis and
[SPEAKER_11]: you know because i feel like cannabis and
hemp are the leading horsemen of this
[SPEAKER_11]: apocalypse in a way you know that are
charging and kind of leading this wave of
[SPEAKER_11]: you know providing this great plant that's
helping to alleviate suffering and provide
[SPEAKER_11]: empowerment and kind of and all the all
the tools for the you know new economy and
[SPEAKER_11]: and green revolution that's to come you
know with this plant and and you know and
[SPEAKER_11]: so i feel like it's helping us with to
gain clarity in this time of revelation
[SPEAKER_11]: and and the way of leading the path for
these other plants and entheogens and
[SPEAKER_11]: ancient medicines to have their way
forward and through this pathway you know
[SPEAKER_11]: i feel like are you know they're the other
horsemen of this apocalypse this giant
[SPEAKER_03]: full circle i mean when mark said it's
like we're all instead of you know instead
[SPEAKER_03]: basically the story of the immortality key
in a nutshell is that there was this
[SPEAKER_03]: unknown unnamed religion that had to have
had something major going on in it because
[SPEAKER_03]: it wasn't about faith it was more like
this ancient greek methodology of thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: and sciences and physics and yeah yeah
yeah exactly and that
[SPEAKER_03]: elixir that they were drinking and then
him having to out of that after so many
[SPEAKER_03]: millennium really you know like coming out
of that experience getting back and
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is of course you know the leading
horsemen like you mentioned and and
[SPEAKER_03]: psychedelic cannabis you have okay we can
take care of you know it's very much
[SPEAKER_03]: reminiscent to me of the bag of agitas and
the way they look at yoga for the body and
[SPEAKER_03]: meditation for the mind you've got
cannabis really i i'm sure you can say
[SPEAKER_03]: it's for the mind and body but then you
have this psychedelics that are for now
[SPEAKER_03]: you know outside that five cents spirit
you know spirit exactly like completely
[SPEAKER_13]: removed from go ahead alex a question i
have so as psychedelics become less
[SPEAKER_13]: regulated and more prevalent in kind of
recreational ways are our labs like sc are
[SPEAKER_13]: you guys doing testing of psychedelics or
are is is there testing of psychedelics or
[SPEAKER_13]: what would that look like i mean is that
again an industry that has to kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: parallel the developing of psychedelic
products or mushrooms or whatever you know
[SPEAKER_11]: people are going to be ingesting or eating
totally yeah so um so so real quick before
[SPEAKER_11]: that um just to wrap that on the thought
too you know because on the like
[SPEAKER_11]: immortality key and everything you know
i'm really fascinated by this new kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: field of archaeochemistry you know where
they're kind of scraping the insides of
[SPEAKER_11]: these ancient bound kind of uh you know
artifacts you know of like chalices and um
[SPEAKER_11]: and also a pop a like you know the key pay
which is a tool that you administer you
[SPEAKER_11]: know this these uh south american
brazilian amazon of powders you know uh
[SPEAKER_11]: through your through nasal cavity right um
you know there you know they found one in
[SPEAKER_11]: chili you scraped it did some argue
chemistry on it and found five meo and
[SPEAKER_11]: ndmt bouffantine which you know
essentially you know and the tool carbon
[SPEAKER_11]: dated like 7 000 years ago and so
essentially it predating kind of the use
[SPEAKER_11]: of this tool to administer your vilka
which are two kind of uh you know really
[SPEAKER_11]: powerful spirit medicines you know through
your through your nasal cavity to your
[SPEAKER_11]: nose you know and so and and it's just
fascinating how deep it's going you know
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of and all the compounds they're
finding but but to your to your point
[SPEAKER_11]: question on on testing you know i'm really
excited about you know because right now
[SPEAKER_11]: you know it's it's you know i mean prop
215 set you know in california set forward
[SPEAKER_11]: away where labs could you know had legal
ability or had had had at least a state
[SPEAKER_11]: proposition of coverage to be able to take
you know these federally illegal schedule
[SPEAKER_11]: one substances you know and you know order
analytical reference standards and begin
[SPEAKER_11]: testing so there's a little bit of
coverage like right now there's no
[SPEAKER_11]: coverage right so you know all the
compounds you know that we're talking
[SPEAKER_11]: about that are coming to be liberalized or
legalized are all currently still
[SPEAKER_11]: federally one controlled substances you
know which you know and so it matters
[SPEAKER_13]: right you can't yeah you have to have
standards for it like i said it's like all
[SPEAKER_13]: those compounds unlike the cannabinoids i
think i believe all these compounds are
[SPEAKER_13]: water soluble um there uh you don't
necessarily have to have oil oil
[SPEAKER_13]: solubility but the nice thing is that if
they're the phenethylamines they have a
[SPEAKER_13]: nice chromophore so they're good
candidates for hplc detection and again i
[SPEAKER_13]: have like no clue like maybe you guys know
or maybe just throw up for discussion like
[SPEAKER_13]: when we look at cannabis like this
beautiful picture of the hash church
[SPEAKER_13]: variety we're looking at we see something
that's got like 20% cannabinoids on that
[SPEAKER_13]: on that flower material what what's the
percentage of uh of psilocybin on
[SPEAKER_13]: mushrooms does anyone know i mean is it
like five percent ten percent well well so
[SPEAKER_11]: and so and so and then that kind of leads
to finish that thought though because um
[SPEAKER_11]: because i think that's i mean there's a
lot to that you know to be discovered just
[SPEAKER_11]: like kind of was happened to have noids
and testing cannabis whenever that kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: came to be but in oregon measure 109
passed which is which legalizes psilocybin
[SPEAKER_11]: and now um now the the state has the next
year and a half or two to develop uh
[SPEAKER_11]: licensing and regulation for for for
licensed and legalized psilocybin and so
[SPEAKER_11]: there's gonna be three licenses
[SPEAKER_11]: so there's a there's a cultivation license
there's a therapy center therapist license
[SPEAKER_11]: and then there's an analytical testing lab
license and so and the and this and this
[SPEAKER_11]: and the the oregon health authority is
going to be the ones regulating and
[SPEAKER_11]: licensing the testing labs and we're
already regulated by the oregon health
[SPEAKER_11]: authority to the highest of degree for
cannabis up and you know for we have a lab
[SPEAKER_11]: open tiger just south of portland and so
we're really excited because we're we're
[SPEAKER_11]: hoping that that kind of gives us just a
bit of a shoe in to be able to do start
[SPEAKER_11]: doing that testing because we have a group
that we're we're going to be working with
[SPEAKER_11]: that has over 120 unique psilocybin
geographical discerned varietals that
[SPEAKER_11]: they're looking to have us begin to like
develop testing to identify the micro
[SPEAKER_11]: characterize or whatever to chemo the
other chemo type of all these different
[SPEAKER_11]: mushrooms so i'm really excited to see how
that comes about but until then you know
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of then you have to have a dda
schedule and license what would it be
[SPEAKER_13]: interesting when you walk in you walk into
the dispensary or the the mushroom
[SPEAKER_13]: dispensary or whatever the hell it is
someday and people are buying based on hey
[SPEAKER_13]: that's got 20 this has got 15 that's got
20 oh you know and the chemo bar the chemo
[SPEAKER_03]: bar oh this one's got baiocystin and
norbaiocystin i'm grabbing these yes
[SPEAKER_11]: exactly that's just about you just
finished my sentence i was just going to
[SPEAKER_11]: bring up nor nor nor nor silicin or
norcelose yeah um yeah but there's and
[SPEAKER_11]: then there's certain varietals and have
kind of their own maois in them and so
[SPEAKER_11]: it'll be really interesting to see where
that goes but ultimately one of my biggest
[SPEAKER_11]: passions in life is around ethnobotany and
theobotany and um and to be able to build
[SPEAKER_11]: off of what we've learned and been able to
you know because cannabis you know for
[SPEAKER_11]: what it's worth it represents probably one
of the most difficult matrices that
[SPEAKER_11]: analytical chemistry has ever had to
approach or test you know and to be able
[SPEAKER_11]: to have learned um you know and so it's an
incredibly difficult process to learn and
[SPEAKER_11]: to actually get right because of how much
you know 30 percent resin content up to
[SPEAKER_11]: that you know gunks up all the hp lcs gcs
mass facts and so to be able to develop
[SPEAKER_11]: methods to resolve that matrix so that you
can do the testing accurately and
[SPEAKER_11]: repeatedly is is such an endeavor and you
know i think those labs that have that
[SPEAKER_11]: that do the work and learn how to how to
operate on such level are going to be some
[SPEAKER_11]: of the highest performing analytical labs
in the world you know because i mean it's
[SPEAKER_11]: we're not you know testing dirt testing
water salt you know a lot of water so
[SPEAKER_11]: they're relatively straightforward but you
know cannabis has just presented this very
[SPEAKER_11]: difficult challenge to analytical
chemistry but but from there you know
[SPEAKER_11]: being able to learn and ultimately test
all these other coming you know incredibly
[SPEAKER_11]: important plant compounds you know is one
of my excitements and passions for you
[SPEAKER_03]: know what we're we're i'm going personally
so alec then when i when i start the
[SPEAKER_03]: traversing the fungal turpinome live show
on my channel here which is going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: similar one to hash church you're in right
yeah yeah all in all in thank you so much
[SPEAKER_11]: that's such a beautiful beautiful that's
such a beautiful name of the paper too and
[SPEAKER_11]: i appreciate that turning me on for sure
yeah absolutely dr mark isn't that just
[SPEAKER_13]: funny that you know again not to go back
to the grateful dead but so as a young
[SPEAKER_13]: dead head you would have your shrooms and
you'd have your bag your weed right so in
[SPEAKER_13]: a way they kind of knew they totally knew
what are you talking about forget about
[SPEAKER_13]: kinda it was like 100 are you kidding me
so you know one thing takes you one way
[SPEAKER_13]: and another thing takes you completely in
a different direction i will mention again
[SPEAKER_03]: because i i love saying traversing the
fungal turpinome it's just awesome but i
[SPEAKER_03]: did start a facebook group called
traversing the fungal turpinome and we've
[SPEAKER_03]: been sharing all sorts of edible mushrooms
and psychedelic mushrooms and
[SPEAKER_03]: identification tips and tricks and stories
and books and it's actually becoming a
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty cool little community so if you are
on facebook if you're not and you hate
[SPEAKER_03]: facebook i don't need to hear about it
it's all good but if you are join the
[SPEAKER_03]: group check us out we're uh we're in there
and it'll be the same name of the show uh
[SPEAKER_03]: when i hopefully get it together so i'll
try to send out an email here soon to alec
[SPEAKER_03]: and dr mark and a few other people i've
been thinking about for this particular
[SPEAKER_03]: show it's going to have some different
people on it for sure and we'll be talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about uh you know not just mushrooms but
uh you know a variety of the psychedelic
[SPEAKER_13]: uh plants and fungi that we yeah colin i
got your comment last week you know on
[SPEAKER_13]: hash church you were like oh i wish mark
was here because he lives near kennett
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah you're near kennett and uh yeah and
also as re you know i'm a i'm a big fan of
[SPEAKER_14]: of you know of psychedelics and i was
reading about you know um five mile and
[SPEAKER_14]: the frog and hunting hunting frogs just
from you know it's it's fascinating how
[SPEAKER_14]: the work that was left behind led to
synthesizing that and um perhaps we can
[SPEAKER_14]: get a couple friends of mine to come on
and talk about that um as well as this you
[SPEAKER_14]: know so what are your thoughts what do you
what are your thoughts on on that is do
[SPEAKER_14]: you think that area is going to get
reinvigorated again uh well uh you mean in
[SPEAKER_13]: fungus yeah well fungus is so fungi is so
diverse they have their own goddamn
[SPEAKER_13]: kingdom for christ sakes right i mean
they're their own fucking thing dude
[SPEAKER_13]: they're just like yeah they figured out
how to make very complex molecules and
[SPEAKER_13]: everything from yeast to uh what
filamentacious fungi probably just said
[SPEAKER_13]: that wrong but you know the fungi that are
in our guts the fungi that are behind
[SPEAKER_13]: marcus my family in upstate new york uh
used to be avid hunters and seekers of the
[SPEAKER_13]: so-called hen of the woods which is sort
of domesticated here down in kennett
[SPEAKER_13]: square phillips calls it the maitake
mushrooms which they grow on um on towers
[SPEAKER_13]: that are made i think of a pvc pipe and
they have some kind of meshing where the
[SPEAKER_13]: nutrient around it and the flower bodies
are kind of growing radially from the
[SPEAKER_13]: nutrients that flow through this thing and
um they they really only get to only so
[SPEAKER_13]: big when they're uh when they're grown
commercially but when you find those in
[SPEAKER_13]: the wild those things could be as big as
the trunk of a volkswagen i mean i've seen
[SPEAKER_13]: these mushrooms be so huge and they're
delicious they're wonderful pickled
[SPEAKER_13]: they're great just in any mushroom recipe
you know whether you're making soups or
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever you do with mushrooms i mean it's
a wonderfully edible mushroom kind of the
[SPEAKER_13]: woods i like to gobble them gobble gobble
there's a couple restaurants of noted
[SPEAKER_13]: variety in vermont called hen of the woods
and there are five star restaurants that
[SPEAKER_13]: are absolutely worth going to so if you're
ever in vermont waterberry good in the hen
[SPEAKER_13]: of the woods it's a wonderful restaurant
sweet i'll check that out listen i i want
[SPEAKER_13]: to oh go ahead i was gonna add one one
thing about psychedelics mark and you'll
[SPEAKER_13]: love this is that you know again if you go
like the fish tour where fish tour kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: got kind of crazy is when people started
doing powders and like mdma and all other
[SPEAKER_13]: shit kind of came in there and to me it's
like the truth right all that other crap
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of like was this toxicity in the
scene that was now we're using the word
[SPEAKER_13]: toxicity to mean toxic and to me it's like
the only true thing the only true thing
[SPEAKER_13]: was was mushrooms and you know lsd if it
was good lsd now that's a big if but you
[SPEAKER_13]: know but to me we stay away from
everything else because i just saw that
[SPEAKER_13]: tear people up and make idiots out of
people and eventually lead to people who
[SPEAKER_03]: are no longer here and change the vibe of
the whole scene like it really did change
[SPEAKER_13]: the vibe when i showed up accidentally we
were going right mark right i mean i i
[SPEAKER_03]: showed up in 93 and it felt like it was
still pretty legit it felt like this is oh
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah it felt pretty oh gee it seemed like
it was around i don't know maybe 97 or not
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah maybe even 99 there was a little bit
of it in 97 on the east coast but yeah it
[SPEAKER_03]: is what it is they they made it through
they're still alive they're rock stars
[SPEAKER_03]: they had to have some stories but it was
it was heavy for sure the whole powdered
[SPEAKER_03]: drug thing seemed unnecessary but uh you
always have a choice terrible humans love
[SPEAKER_03]: white powders i don't know what it is well
humans love it seems as though you know
[SPEAKER_03]: not to get too heavy into it but you know
if we can agree on that it's likely that
[SPEAKER_03]: we came from some somewhere maybe a source
maybe we were all one energy and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going all to this one energy and this
particular experience is a splintered
[SPEAKER_03]: fractured ego version that you get to be
you and you get to do whatever you want
[SPEAKER_03]: and you don't have you're not a part of
everything yet you kind of are but you get
[SPEAKER_03]: to make mistakes and you get to make bad
choices and some people are here to make
[SPEAKER_03]: bad choices they want to make lots of bad
choices and guess what that's that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: freedom of life right there they get to do
that if that's so what they choose to do
[SPEAKER_03]: other people we try to make good choices
and we end up making some bad choices
[SPEAKER_03]: along the way so it all seems to be a
challenge around every corner it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: should i eat the mushroom or should i
snort the cocaine and i mean
[SPEAKER_03]: metaphorically because i'm not a big
cocaine snorter at all but metaphorically
[SPEAKER_03]: there's always those two options it's kind
of like should i make take this choice
[SPEAKER_03]: over here should i take this choice over
here and they all tend to lead us to one
[SPEAKER_03]: place where we all get to end up which is
six feet in the ground unless you're
[SPEAKER_13]: getting like prince you know like everyone
we're all gonna die what what what a shame
[SPEAKER_13]: again that that he had a doctor who is
feeding him with all that toxic shit and
[SPEAKER_13]: as talented as prince was and it's
terrible to lose someone and now that just
[SPEAKER_13]: have his musical legacy around but you
know just um yeah we've all lost loved
[SPEAKER_13]: ones to substance abuse and it's it's just
it's terrible and you'd think man if they
[SPEAKER_13]: just would have ate some mushrooms and
smoked some weed they'd still be here well
[SPEAKER_11]: you know and and i really appreciate both
those those those two thoughts you know um
[SPEAKER_11]: i feel like i've been on a mission kind of
uh especially you know kind of doing as
[SPEAKER_11]: much work as i've been doing over the last
decade with with other plant ceremonies
[SPEAKER_11]: medicine work kind of ayahuasca etc etc um
yeah i feel i'm on a mission to help uh my
[SPEAKER_11]: friends learn how to do better drugs you
know and and and and and to be you know i
[SPEAKER_11]: feel like we have an obligation in this
life to be spiritual forklifts for each
[SPEAKER_11]: other and and i feel like there's a lot of
really like basic like low vibration you
[SPEAKER_11]: know vibes that are just overly consumed
and leveraged you know by some of our
[SPEAKER_11]: closest friends and family you know and so
to be able to help you know in that way
[SPEAKER_11]: educate and like live by example you know
how much they've benefited us i feel like
[SPEAKER_11]: we can hopefully help kind of you know
that hundred monkey effect of you know
[SPEAKER_11]: getting off the bad and onto the real
medicines that are actually quite
[SPEAKER_13]: fascinating my my my wife and i were with
a couple other couples and we had dropped
[SPEAKER_13]: some acid we were sitting at this one
outdoor uh restaurant we were just
[SPEAKER_13]: laughing up a storm we were just having
such a great time we were having such a
[SPEAKER_13]: great time that the table next to us said
we want whatever they're drinking so i
[SPEAKER_13]: mean yeah i mean i i think it kind of like
it radiates people know they're like those
[SPEAKER_03]: people are extra happy that's when you
bring them a tiny you bring them a tiny
[SPEAKER_03]: tiny little shot glass and you're like
here you go they're like what the hell is
[SPEAKER_03]: this it's like it's about 250 milligrams
uh here you go yes well listen it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: great conversation today i completely
enjoyed it i did want to finish up one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing which alex just meant in regards to
we need to be spiritual forklifts um for
[SPEAKER_03]: each other and i think that is a very good
term i really like it and what i wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: mention about that was you know i've been
following this guy on youtube for a while
[SPEAKER_03]: even waiting for quite a while now he's a
rapper freestyle guy i've mentioned him a
[SPEAKER_03]: few times harry mac is his name he used to
rap on venice beach and he was at one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the high time cannabis cups and uh he's
got a video out right now on his channel
[SPEAKER_03]: it's called making an emotional connection
through freestyle it's from two days ago
[SPEAKER_03]: i'll share it in the chat i would
definitely implore everyone to go see that
[SPEAKER_03]: because man what he does in that video is
he is he becomes a spiritual forklift for
[SPEAKER_03]: the guy right at the end so this this
heavy set guy comes in at the end he's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of he seems pretty drunk and he's
kind of happy but he's really sad at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time and the way harry connects with
them and freestyles about what this guy's
[SPEAKER_03]: going through from having a two-minute
conversation with him is absolutely
[SPEAKER_03]: phenomenal it'll definitely bring a tear
to your eye and i thought what a great way
[SPEAKER_03]: to end the sunday show uh with that if i
thought it wouldn't breach um a copyright
[SPEAKER_03]: law i would i would share it right here
and now but i wouldn't want to take the
[SPEAKER_03]: chance to lose this episode of hash church

[SPEAKER_03]: to thank everyone for coming out superly

[SPEAKER_03]: offer up their time uh to come on here and
