[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, just hopping in the boat for the
first time of the season and heading out
[SPEAKER_07]: onto the Pacific Ocean here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We call this little section the Howe Sound
and it is my home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got my little dog with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oris, how's it going buddy?
[SPEAKER_07]: You good, you good?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You love on the boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was hoping on getting a few friends
out on the boat today, but for now I think
[SPEAKER_07]: we're just going to head out to the
backside of Gambier, or sorry,
[SPEAKER_07]: Boyer, which is that island right in front
of me there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That little guy that's the closest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And well, I think we'll go have a little
dab session over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't see the next life.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't, they won't, they
won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many are recycled garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't see the next life.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't, they won't, they won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't react before you know now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may act on an impulse that's rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's rough, that's rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your next door neighbor has a wrong
impression of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's rough, that's rough, that's rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filling up folly against someone who is
innocent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's rough, that's rough, that's rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in a folly meditation.
[SPEAKER_00]: With false impressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's rough, that's rough, that's rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't you be sorry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reacted on a false impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to pull before you react.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to pull before you react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't you be sorry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reacted on a false impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to pull before you react.
[SPEAKER_07]: So be sure to pull before you react.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gonna be calm unless the water's
coming up from a particular angle.
[SPEAKER_07]: From up north, from Squamish.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just checking it out to see if there's any
seals on the rocks because well the moms,
[SPEAKER_07]: they come here and they lay their babies
out on the rocks just to hang tough and
[SPEAKER_07]: then they go feed for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go hunt for food.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gonna see potentially out here
we'll see bald eagles, gold eagles,
[SPEAKER_07]: sea lions, seals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Killer whales, humpback whales,
blue whales, and Pacific white-sided
[SPEAKER_07]: dolphins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are all little bits of nature that
you can see out in here and it's pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: damn sweet when you see it, I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_07]: The seals, they blend right in with the
rocks though so they're literally the
[SPEAKER_07]: hardest thing to see on the coast here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's gotta be some here
though.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're always here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty early but...
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll tag along the side of the island
here for a little bit and see if we can't
[SPEAKER_07]: catch a little wildlife to have a session
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: My dog will keep an eye out on things.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you say, Oris?
[SPEAKER_05]: Out on the water?
[SPEAKER_05]: Co-pilot?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dog is my co-pilot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at how beautiful the mountains are
that you don't see very often because they
[SPEAKER_07]: are where I live.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not in my view but those are the
mountains that I live on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised we haven't seen any seals
out here yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually would have seen like 20 or 30.
[SPEAKER_07]: It must be too early.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they're all out somewhere else hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, what a beautiful day it is today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hope D420K and Johnny B can get out
later today to come for a little spin,
[SPEAKER_07]: come for a little puff down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Geez, I guess you could call this ocean
dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: The ocean dab session.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope my buddies out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Show them the beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can live out here for a long time and
if you don't have a boat, it's really
[SPEAKER_07]: quite a different experience from having a
boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably gonna truck around this whole
island once I've had a few puffs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kinda hoping on showing you guys
some seals but we might have to wait for
[SPEAKER_07]: that because it seems like it's a little
bit early.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about 8 in the morning right now so I
really jumped the gun today and got out
[SPEAKER_07]: nice and early.
[SPEAKER_07]: So sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give you guys a little view of what I'm
checking out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the water is down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not as low, low, low as it goes but it's
definitely a little bit low from the tide
[SPEAKER_07]: marks that you can see across the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit more careful around this side
because you have more rocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a seal poking his head out over
there on the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably some out of the water but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another one over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: This could be the mom's hunting.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the babies relax on the rocks but I
haven't seen any babies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually don't go too close into this
little area because you can smoke rocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although right now we are 53 feet,
57 feet so not too bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell you those rock towers can come up
pretty damn fast though when you're
[SPEAKER_07]: cruising along in a boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks as good as any spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get this untied.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bimini.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boat essential for the Howe Sound.
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting a hot summer this year and it is
really, really essential to have this
[SPEAKER_07]: thing down when you're a pasty white guy
like me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Must hide from sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Must hide from sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we made it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We made it to my office.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sitting on the back side.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we're sitting on the east side.
[SPEAKER_07]: The east coast of Boyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boyer Island if you want to Google that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the Howe Sound and it's a
habitable island.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a few people that live on it but
not a ton.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got seals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three or four of them floating right in
front of the boat now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they'll come up to the side and to
the back and we'll see them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today I'm just going to have a quick
little session out here with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't have a ton to talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really figured more than anything
this would be an eye candy video.
[SPEAKER_07]: The boat's on a slow 360 degree turn so
we're going to get the mountains in
[SPEAKER_07]: behind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'll eventually be posting up
towards the north where you can see the
[SPEAKER_07]: Diamond Head and the Garibaldi Mountains
as well as Anvil Island.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the islands here in the Howe Sound.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got my mothership Taurus filled up
with ocean water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rocking the DC glass banger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: DC glass and I brought out a little bit of
rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got that right there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you can't really see it especially
because it's not in the sun but just trust
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's amazing and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah I'm going to invite Johnny B and
D420K out on the boat later on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully they come out for a little
session.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be kind of fun to have them out on the
boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know for me having a boat is really
mostly about just a good 50 percent of it
[SPEAKER_07]: is doing this right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting to where you're going.
Stopping.
[SPEAKER_07]: Having an awesome session.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is boat fun to the T for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other part of this boat that I really
love which we're going to do this summer
[SPEAKER_07]: is wake skating wake surfing and wake
boarding.
[SPEAKER_07]: In that order wake skating is by far my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wake surfing is my second favorite because
you don't need the rope and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: cool to get in behind and jam behind the
boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then wake boarding is kind of on my
third of the list.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got hurt a couple years ago trying to
jump a wave and tweaked my neck and have
[SPEAKER_07]: to admit I've been a little bit afraid of
the wakeboard ever since.
[SPEAKER_07]: The wake skate and the wake surf I'm able
to easily jump off and it is removed from
[SPEAKER_07]: my feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll tell you when you whip when you
when you bail at 20 miles plus an hour on
[SPEAKER_07]: that wakeboard and it grabs the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll tell you that is some serious
ankle pain that you do not want.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that many of you out there can
attest.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess it's time to light this puppy
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Loving the DC bangers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Real thick glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of a little bit of a nerve wrecker in
the sense that you really do need a decent
[SPEAKER_07]: torch.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to have a decent flame to get
this thing hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just burning off a little bit of my last
hit that I took here before I went on cam.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know you got to take that hit just to
make sure it's going to work out.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pre hit hit I like to call it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I take a pre pre hit hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure most of you know they're out
there what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love the portability of the mothership
Taurus as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I don't feel it with my straight
fab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously the thing is huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I definitely don't feel it with my egg
either.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Taurus just really feels like a
piece that you can bring with you
[SPEAKER_07]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I damn near have haven't I.
All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dabs on the ocean.
[SPEAKER_07]: Surprisingly not as warm as you might
think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never got to orange.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Loving the mothership.
[SPEAKER_07]: Loving the rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And loving the house sound today on the
boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting a little bit close.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll back her up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing that you boat people will
recognize.
[SPEAKER_07]: The endless backing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to be too close to that
coastline.
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily for me this boat has a great
reverse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always remember when you're backing up in
a boat to to look.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you if there was anything
floating or you know God forbid like a
[SPEAKER_07]: rope or something from someone's buoy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You pretty much going to say goodbye to
your prop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Goodbye to boating for that day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've learned all the lessons the hard way
that is for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the incredible amazing spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Might head up to Horseshoe Bay or Bowen
Island later.
[SPEAKER_07]: You start getting you stop at this spot
and then you head to the next spot and you
[SPEAKER_07]: can travel a fair distance throughout the
house sound.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean it's pretty big.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping on getting Rob Clark up here
this summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was thinking of heading up to
California.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if he did he was going to try and make
it make it up north to see us for a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob is an avid fisherman.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to do salmon fishing with Rob
Clark video here in the house sound.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the pinks are running this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's totally realistic that we could
that we could get such a thing done.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up Horace.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up little bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: My dog gets slightly nervous on the boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not too nervous but just nervous enough to
give a little a little comfort.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have too too much left to
say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already mentioned a few times
Periscope new app doing some live video
[SPEAKER_07]: footage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quality is not that great but it's kind of
cool how fast you can just go live.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am going to be using that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those of you that enjoy
Bubbleman's world and might feel that
[SPEAKER_07]: you're missing out you can just check me
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Add me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: BCBubbleman.
[SPEAKER_07]: The app works through Twitter so you can't
really avoid that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the app is called Periscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I may just go live right now on
Periscope at BCBubbleman.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this video is not over.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a little bit more boating to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys are coming with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright so just as I started to pull away
I saw a gold eagle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't react before you know now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may act on an impulse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your next door neighbor has a wrong
impression of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filling up folly against someone who is
innocent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for the shitty footage there guys
but yeah that bird was flying at about 35
[SPEAKER_07]: miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: They seem to hang out off the coast of
this island almost all the time where the
[SPEAKER_07]: most place the place I've seen golden
eagles the most is right here on off the
[SPEAKER_07]: coast of Boyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a little bit of the how sound for
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wish I could have showed you a little bit
more wildlife.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be trucking around out here for the
rest of the summer though so I'll try and
[SPEAKER_07]: catch some whales and some dolphins at
least to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always nice to share dabs with the
dolphins and the whales.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess I'll call it a day on this
particular video.
[SPEAKER_07]: I may still get together with D420K and
Johnny B or one or the other if not both I
[SPEAKER_07]: hope.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that'll probably be another video to
ensue as well so stay tuned and keep
[SPEAKER_07]: watching Buggleman's World.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for your support.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times you've been on the other
side someone's making judgment of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong.
That's wrong.
