[SPEAKER_02]: All right, wicked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch your dog, then.
Go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dog will go when the people run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look who's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look who's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Waba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Waba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hi to Bubble Man's world, Waba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time, Bubble Man, respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Years have passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to have you back again, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked, respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: All time, friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Friend for life.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ready?
Go
[SPEAKER_03]: see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my friend's in the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's cracking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys at the Blue Hole know how to hold
it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow good herbs, jump into pools full of
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to do one more.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: You push the power button.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see the red little dot?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting here with Kevin from Steam
Team Jamaica, the original vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the Steam Chalice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've never been, never smoked or
vaporized from a unit like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't believe it until you try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It truly is the original vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That all these volcanoes and other units
that have come years later, this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting in Waba's ganja field at the Blue
Hole is not too bad either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do some six-star bubble
hash dabs on top of the Steam Chalice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing with the Steam Team, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a J.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: thing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really odd, man, vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of cold and melting
deliciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give thanks to the bubble hash niceness,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and if you want to forget this Steam
Chalice, you can always check out the www
[SPEAKER_00]: .steamteamja.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes the vaping experience much,
much nicer, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one at home that I got out here
that I quite enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of getting used to the
procedures of having the husk,
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to create the coal,
being able to, you know, keep your coochie
[SPEAKER_02]: clean and take care of the unit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Changing the water out of the coconut's
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, don't leave that in there for
too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It becomes stagnant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you smoke throughout a day,
no problem, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: dump out water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of it like you would take care
of any pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we keep it fresh and keep it with a
fresh load, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give thanks for blazing up with the Steam
Team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
Respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough respect, B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the greens upon the scene,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Check the greens upon the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're surrounded by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some wonderful tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smells in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so this is a tangy as well?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangy, tangy, tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say that's sour tangy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dank for where you and I live.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just definitively dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter where it's from.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it dank or is it not dank?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't see, like, not everyone's
producing this quality herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Jamaica, true enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder where Geronimo is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to link with him again one day
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I seen him at Step Behind a couple years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Custom trim by Waba himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Award-winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Award-winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Award-winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't leave that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This crazy guy jumping off of trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your name again?
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, I got nothing to say, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica, my boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump, boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh,
girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going?
40k.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still a record, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Limbu, oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me try that chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, we got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steamed team Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go get a different tangent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we steaming that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured something was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't steam it because we have more.
[SPEAKER_02]: If only we had a steamer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a steamer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I like about Kevin's steamer is it's
always steaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never not steaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the next one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the next one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Steamed team Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rooftop session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's a Moringa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uncle Jammin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and they just left them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they still have the tables here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be a great place to fly a drone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the name of that one now that
was the Congo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Twister.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twister.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this all twister?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see the twister just for the
camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Need to get into a better light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this bud the baby just gave me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here with Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we're here about to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are absolutely going to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to film for a few minutes,
and then I'm going to pull out my dab rig,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're going to hit some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love that Waba is just trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all just sitting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always trimming, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just missed your second dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that taste, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet, sweet, sweet goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these beautifully curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cured buds.

[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, come on up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure, Waba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
Thank you, Waba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Waba.

Thank you, Waba.
