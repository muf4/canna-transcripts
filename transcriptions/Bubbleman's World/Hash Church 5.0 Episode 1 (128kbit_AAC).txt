[SPEAKER_07]: All right, recording in progress.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what that means?
[SPEAKER_07]: It means it is time to go live with
Hashturch.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start letting everyone in once we go
live.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll give a big old welcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we will.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're getting close.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always nervous while waiting to go live.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: How long can you take?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
Redirecting.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's let everyone in and we'll figure it
out together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just trying to organize the disarray.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going live here for the first time in
almost over a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to see if it's going to go live on
a new page or if it will be live on the
[SPEAKER_07]: same page.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to figure this out right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashturch 5.0 episode one with wave
laughter in the house, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man, it was nice to see your email
come in, being like, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll join for an episode of Hashturch.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been too long.
[SPEAKER_07]: The funny things that come and go in our
lives and we sort of don't even realize we
[SPEAKER_07]: miss them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is one of them for me,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed hanging out and seeing you on a
weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, let's do it today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to figure out if it went live
on the same page that I created or if it
[SPEAKER_07]: created a new page.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having a hard time figuring that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not live on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I don't see you live on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we're live on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can send you the link if you like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it in front of me, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll try refreshing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It went to a different page, Thomas.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does it to me all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I go to open live on Zoom and it opens a
completely different YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm a little bit not doing it right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have to help me for next week.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the meantime, we're live on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 59 people watching right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all I usually do is I go in to the one
that's live and then I go into the one
[SPEAKER_07]: that's not live and I just send the link a
bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it seems like a ton of people,
they must have gotten the notification or
[SPEAKER_07]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ryan's in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Papa Sith.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my homie in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_07]: He runs the bubble man brand in the lab
and makes all of our live hash rosin and
[SPEAKER_07]: hash hits and traditional hash and all the
products that we're making over in
[SPEAKER_07]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ryan really, yeah, he's been
indispensable help over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he he helped.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought, well, I'm going to invite him
on the hash church, create some some new
[SPEAKER_07]: panelists.
[SPEAKER_07]: So welcome to you, homie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: And welcome to Mojave as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Richmond's in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Little rusty.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, no, Thomas, you'll have to help
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I give all the key and the this and the
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I must have done it wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why it didn't go live on the
actual.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, we'll be able to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can help you with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also edited it right at the end of the
day and changed the I added episode one,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that might have also glitched it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for whatever reason, it shows that
we're live.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got 75 people watching us at 903.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels good, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know skunk man Sam can be popping in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Dr. Mark said he would be making
an appearance, so I'll just hit up Sam
[SPEAKER_07]: real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure he's all good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is out of town, so we won't be seeing
him today, but hopefully we see him in the
[SPEAKER_07]: next.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, in the next couple of weeks or so,
if we keep if we keep going here.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time I started Hash Church,
I think I did 162 Sundays in a row.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was that was absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Around 140, my wife sort of pulled me
aside and she's like, what's wrong with
[SPEAKER_07]: you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so stressful trying to make sure
the episode was perfect, that the
[SPEAKER_07]: panelists would show up, that everything
would start on time, that I would have
[SPEAKER_07]: Internet depending on the country that I
was in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's just much more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm happy to just catch up with you
guys, you know, get a little get a little
[SPEAKER_07]: update from everyone in regards to how
you're doing and what you've been up to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's been a long year,
and I'm sure life is been a hard year,
[SPEAKER_07]: not just a long year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been one of those years that's kind
of like, whoo, jeez, get that one under
[SPEAKER_07]: our belt and move on to the next year if
we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bizarre world, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a bizarre world year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been a bizarre world year.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, anyone that's eaten enough
psychedelics can know that the the energy
[SPEAKER_07]: in the world right now is is very intense.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's almost like you can just feel
something going on underneath in a way
[SPEAKER_07]: that, hey, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, how are you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought this was a video.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be back.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So audio is good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Marcus says the usual mic settings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the audio OK?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fall before the storm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it did just say something went wrong
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Host on YouTube live.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something went wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, something went wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we lost our.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, no, we're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's live.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought he just popped in.
[SPEAKER_07]: In and out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you, if I ever took a hit and
the smoke came out, the color of the smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: on Thomas's room right now, I would
absolutely I'd be like, what the fuck is
[SPEAKER_07]: this?
[SPEAKER_06]: I obviously clicked on the wrong window.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, welcome back, I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought maybe you were like,
this is an official.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to hit a nice little dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, Ryan, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just sent I just sent him the link on
Facebook two minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: He definitely said he was going to be
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have to give him time.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did it go off again?
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, there we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to close that link.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure we're live.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure we get the chat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And load up a bowl and start some
conversations with you guys because it has
[SPEAKER_07]: been way too long.
I.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's it's been.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long, a long year as we were
mentioning a little earlier on,
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking maybe Wade, it would be
great to get an update from you.
[SPEAKER_07]: See what you've been up to in the last
year and.
[SPEAKER_07]: Catch us all up man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, glad to throw you all in,
but I'll start by saying there's not been
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of warm, fuzzy, fringed groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cancer is a bear to keep it as simple
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dealing with multiple myeloma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you all know that,
but that's my situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was first diagnosed in the fall of 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, according to my medical
records, I had innumerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great phrase, innumerable lytic
fractures, bone fractures from my skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: My jaw, my neck, my chest, my rib cage,
my pelvis and my right femur, innumerable
[SPEAKER_00]: lytic fractures where the bone gets eroded
by the cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make it really short, the real
issue here is pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here to testify to the beauty and
efficacy of cannabis in the relief of
[SPEAKER_00]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my oncologist asked me to stop
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I make tinctures, high potency
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I eat Rajan and hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that there's really lovely tastes
available by consumption into the gut
[SPEAKER_00]: versus inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a whole conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, I've just started treatment
therapy again after being off of it since
[SPEAKER_00]: May.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose one of the things that I'm
really looking forward to chatting with
[SPEAKER_00]: you all about is I came across a paper in
a journal called biofactors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at three different
multiple myeloma cell lines and compared
[SPEAKER_00]: those multiple myeloma cell lines to how
did they react to quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_00]: minor phytochondromoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out, hello, CBG, as in golf,
and CBN, as in Nancy, have really
[SPEAKER_00]: remarkable effects at slowing the growth
of multiple myeloma cells and at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: dose, triggering cell death in multiple
myeloma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came across that paper on Monday of this
past week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've already, I put out the word here
in Nevada County in California asking for
[SPEAKER_00]: help, specifically asking some of the
manufacturers who had access to CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: material and or CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG, I'm really grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our local manufacturers supplied me
with almost 30 grams of the high potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 plus percent oil of CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still working on trying to get some CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to say, I feel really blessed to
live in Nevada County, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small county.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got about 100,000 people altogether
in this county.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somehow or another, this is one of the
places where organic agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in the cannabis realm,
took root back in the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the fellows I know here locally has
been into minor, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochemicals long enough that he bought
the web domain name, cbboil.com,
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day, for $8 and change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long he's been in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to name names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vital, I tell extracts, Laska,
I could go on and on, Emerald Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these people are making high
potency oils and providing them not just
[SPEAKER_00]: to me, but to any person who shows up at
our local dispensary with a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a program to give these products
at no cost to the person to need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time, I'm actually a
recipient of the program that I helped set
[SPEAKER_00]: up that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just sort of summarize my
situation at the moment to say my spirit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel very full of myself in the spirit,
but the body is really having a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will note that for most people,
multiple myeloma is not a fatal condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's other things that happen as a result
of treating the condition that usually
[SPEAKER_00]: results in death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here for years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep doing Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love talking about hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to love smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I love eating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really looking forward to hearing what all
of y'all are up to and what's been going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'll go back to listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love and thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really enjoy this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to some of the people I respect
so much in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, agreed, Wade.
[SPEAKER_07]: And great to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And listen, if you want to share any of
those names in the chat, I can put them in
[SPEAKER_07]: the description.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe some people who are living in
your area hear what you say.
[SPEAKER_07]: And rather than, you know, enable to
shorten the ability for them to get to A
[SPEAKER_07]: to B, we can remove sort of all of the
middle things by just putting up a few
[SPEAKER_07]: links for companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not trying to blow companies up that
are doing good work and donating.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would also say perhaps for some of
the growers that may be watching as well,
[SPEAKER_07]: if we put up these links, you know,
maybe they won't just be people reaching
[SPEAKER_07]: out who need oil, but there'll be people
reaching out who have biomass to donate
[SPEAKER_07]: for companies like this that can give that
oil away because without that aspect,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's really just out of pocket for the one
group.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what a great thing to be a part of,
you know, gifting out oil to people who
[SPEAKER_07]: are really in the need.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a lot of people are looking to
fill a hole in their soul right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't happen with new Nikes and
Bugatti Veyrons.
[SPEAKER_07]: It happens by serving the people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you can do that, you will feel,
you know, God or whatever it is you
[SPEAKER_07]: believe in in your heart by serving
others.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I always feel it when Wade comes in
and shares with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so crazy to think 10 years ago,
he was sharing about the Harlequin and
[SPEAKER_07]: about like creating and doing this work
himself, giving away biomass.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now he's on the receiving end of it in
this beautiful sort of karmic retribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where it just came right around and said,
hey, homie, like you took care of so many
[SPEAKER_07]: people for so long.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now there's going to be people taking care
of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really quite powerful to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to Best Friend Farms who just
popped in.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're just chilling out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You probably caught the end of Wade's
update.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been fighting the good fight against
cancer and looking good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, and looking good, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, didn't even give a beat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doctor told him he couldn't smoke anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like he's gobbling it down,
which I will say I have never seen a human
[SPEAKER_07]: being eat more cannabinoids in my life
than Thomas up in the corner of the screen
[SPEAKER_07]: with the rain falling down.
[SPEAKER_07]: That fucking guy ate like 24.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time I say this, he's like,
oh, it wasn't that much, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was only like 1800.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was 2400 milligrams for a plane
ride.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember if it was Berlin or
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of those places.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is this gets into the chemistry
and the science of the body.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, Mark, we're all metabolizing at
different rates.
[SPEAKER_07]: How is it that someone can get destroyed
by two milligrams and another person can
[SPEAKER_07]: take twenty four hundred milligrams and
totally be cognitive talking to me like
[SPEAKER_07]: right sitting next to me like,
hey, man, you want a bagel?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easy to eat now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: THC is what he was he was consuming.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just yeah, it's mind blowing to think
that someone could consume that much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mind eating it myself,
but I'm kind of like once I get into the
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 milligram range, that's like I'm like,
oh, I'm like more high than I want to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm good with 10 and 20.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about the rest of the group
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably got some hundos in the mix,
but oh, yeah, available.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, but does it not also depend on how
you metabolize in your liver?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, yeah, it's a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's if it's THC, a right,
it's one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's THC, it's another right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I think that like if you're just
eating hash, if just a lot of it is just
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be sort of, you know,
making it down to the gut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's probably entering in the system
and more in the stomach than in the liver.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think it's bio available,
you know, when it gets metabolized.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I mean, that's probably helping
him in great ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, again, this is like
the full, what did we call us the
[SPEAKER_06]: hunterage effect or ensemble effect or
whatever the fact that CBN and CBG both
[SPEAKER_06]: play a role.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'd imagine that, you know,
you could almost dial that in to a
[SPEAKER_06]: specific oil that's got a specific amount
of CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was going to ask you,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like what what's effective in
terms of CBN concentration in the products
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're taking?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is it highly concentrated CBF is
actually there is CBN isolate,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think it's completely synthetic
that's out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's also just tied, you know,
in concentration CBN oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you doing more of a full spectrum or
isolate treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not had any success so far in
sourcing CBN, particularly at the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities of milligrams that I'm hoping
to be able to access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have access to abundant CBG still
working on CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my point of view, one of the
things I think is most interesting is the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that are produced very early
in the plant's life cycle and the
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation products at the end of the
plant's life cycle show the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: promise for this particular cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's intriguing to me that as a
consumer of cannabis, I tend to avoid CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I don't see any anti-cancer
effects from my cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was always puzzling to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so there's a there's something
that's going on to make sort of so called
[SPEAKER_06]: compliant distillate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when they distill, you know,
quote unquote hemp, like it's like a 21
[SPEAKER_06]: variety or better or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you still have enough THC in the
distillate.
[SPEAKER_06]: What they've been doing is if you heat up
that distillate and bubble air through it,
[SPEAKER_06]: the air will oxidize the THC and convert
it over to CBN such that you can actually
[SPEAKER_06]: make a quote unquote, compliable oil
that's below the point three threshold,
[SPEAKER_06]: because a lot of these distillates are
like a couple percent in THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even you could do this at the crude
level, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just like a crude ethanol extract,
if you bubble air through while you're
[SPEAKER_06]: heating the oil, the air will convert the
THC into CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might be able to do that on your
own and not have to rely on somebody else
[SPEAKER_06]: providing it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be talking to some of our local
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they do that to make so so called
while they call it remediated oil or
[SPEAKER_06]: what's called tea free oil or tea free
distillate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way that they're pulling off that
stunt is, yeah, by in that process,
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't lose a lot of your CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could eventually start converting some
of your CBD, but you could sort of finesse
[SPEAKER_06]: that process to basically remove THC or
get it below the detectable limit or at
[SPEAKER_06]: least below the point three limit and make
it what's called tea free.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you see that category of tea free
distillate or tea free crude, that's
[SPEAKER_06]: probably how they did it, which is this
remediation process by using just simply
[SPEAKER_06]: air.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we have it available in Canada by the
leader.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBN is fairly pure, but it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the last time I checked,
I think it was eleven thousand dollars a
[SPEAKER_07]: liter, whereas like distillate like THC or
CBD is, I want to say, like below two
[SPEAKER_07]: dollars, like maybe under a dollar even
somewhere around there anyway per gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could buy CBN isolate for cheaper
than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, CBN isolate down here is
somewhere like about three or four
[SPEAKER_06]: thousand a kilo.
[SPEAKER_07]: This will be from a plant like derived
right from cannabis for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that Canada allows any type
of synthesis on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is completely synthetic, Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I knew that's why I mentioned
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured you were talking about the
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually talking with someone
yesterday and they said it was twelve
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred dollars in Canada for distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was ninety two percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of at mine by a dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, well, what's the point of
growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy it at that cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to ask Wade, are you taking
everything or orally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: My cousin, 18 months ago, was diagnosed
with stage four liver cancer and he can't
[SPEAKER_02]: take anything or orally, just he gets way
too high and he can't really smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's been taking it suppository and
it's pretty it's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just did like like they tested
all his tumors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did x rays and in three months they
haven't had any growth at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been just take.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he he was told he only had
six months to live 18 months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was he came and actually stayed
with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been just like taking so much oil
and he goes in in a hyperbaric chamber,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's called with pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like the combo combination of
these two, it's pretty incredible that
[SPEAKER_02]: he's still with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks, Tom.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always good to share the like minded
stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, I wanted to introduce Ryan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ryan's going to kind of give us a little
lowdown.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ryan's kind of like, you know,
how do I put it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like one of these younger gung ho
guys that you see yourself in,
[SPEAKER_07]: like his passion and his excitement about
hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't have my brand in a place like
Michigan without Ryan or someone exactly
[SPEAKER_07]: like them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, someone that has the passion,
someone that's been like, I watched the
[SPEAKER_07]: hash churches.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've studied what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I listened to every video.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've learned from my own mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went off and did my own mistakes and
created this knowledge that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: you just obviously we need great growers
and we need a variety of things to do a
[SPEAKER_07]: brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: But really, without without a guy like
Ryan, the brand wouldn't be going anywhere
[SPEAKER_07]: fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why don't you introduce yourself,
homie, and tell us about a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: about you, like where you came from,
how you got into this, and now a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit about what we're doing together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my name is Ryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a hash maker in southeast Michigan,
from Cleveland, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I moved to Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been up here on and off for five
years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Marcus reached out last May and
we've been teaming up, bringing the bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: man brand here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, lately we're working on some brick
hash and some hash hits that we're about
[SPEAKER_03]: to bring to the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also have two flights of rosin
pens, like 70, 90, 120 of two flavors of
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry lemonade and queen of diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we did some more full spectrum
pens too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put you on the spot there, hey,
sometimes it's not so easy just jumping on
[SPEAKER_07]: the old hot seat at hash charts and be
like, all right, tell us about yourself,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to
change it to just one person screen when
[SPEAKER_07]: they're talking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually forgotten this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a update for me, Thomas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in the top right, we're in the view.
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's you.
[SPEAKER_07]: With the LED lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you tell us a little bit about
yourself, Thomas?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you've ever been on hash
charts.
[SPEAKER_07]: People have obviously seen your show on my
channel.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Thomas and I have been working
together for a little while now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's been six months or
even if it's almost a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, he's got the Grandmaster LEDs,
the UVC lights, the whole variety of
[SPEAKER_07]: insanity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thomas is kind of like a mad scientist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Savant when it comes to producing and
creating light that if you tell him he
[SPEAKER_07]: can't do it, he will absolutely fucking do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my team kind of gets mad at me that
sometimes because, well, just even the
[SPEAKER_02]: light that you're looking at, we
redesigned it three different times or
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll, you know, when doing something,
you have a completed product and then all
[SPEAKER_02]: of a sudden you see a better way of doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been in the lighting business for
seven and a half years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing outdoors since 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: Been growing outdoors since 94.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really big passion for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, like I obviously I got involved
in this originally to make money,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then just obviously fell in love with
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had like a really big
breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a couple of things that I
really wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the biggest breakthrough is the
UVC and using it as a pesticide because,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, in all my years of growing,
we've broken the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: By just using a little small amount of
light with a small amount of wattage for a
[SPEAKER_02]: short period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've developed a way to be able to
completely just eliminate the need for
[SPEAKER_02]: predator bugs and pesticides when you're
to deal with thrips and other pests that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're still working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been really, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that's like just absolutely
huge that's changing, growing for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody is under canopy lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been highly debated for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually, two years ago had designed
an inter canopy light where it kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: goes in the middle of your canopy and it's
kind of like a low wattage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we just did not see really good
data or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw other clients of ours using
under canopy lighting and having stupid
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say stupid, we're talking 30 to 40%
gains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, at the same time,
eliminating all your bee buds and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: color differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people have been making this
argument about, oh, it doesn't line up
[SPEAKER_02]: with the science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the science of it is the light is
actually going through the leaves and
[SPEAKER_02]: being caught.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing that makes sense
because we've just seen incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing that we've just kind
of finished developing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just kind of exciting seeing what's
been happening because it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: changing the game and just, it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've been seeing for some of the
people, like depending on where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: producing, I know, well, Michigan,
we just set up shop in Michigan ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's cause it's so much cheaper to
operate and real estate is so much cheaper
[SPEAKER_02]: over there than California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I was seeing the cost of what
people are having to deal with and
[SPEAKER_02]: operating in California, it is insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I thought we had it bad here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the California rent and just the cost
of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so many of my friends that have,
I mean, I'm sure Mommy and Wade have a
[SPEAKER_07]: bigger list, but just lots of people
dropped out, dropped off.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just were like, fuck, I can't fuck
with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is absolutely impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had like seeing people paying $37,000 a
month rent at like uncertain places and
[SPEAKER_02]: these $20,000 bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just, I would just, it would be so
hard to operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can only imagine just seeing the,
and some of the red tape, like Canada has
[SPEAKER_02]: some really disgustingly bad red tape,
especially like, but it's gotten easier to
[SPEAKER_02]: do things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's so much easier to become.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like five years ago, becoming an LP took
like millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you need to almost need like $5
million liquid cash five years ago to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely did.
[SPEAKER_07]: We rented our house.
[SPEAKER_07]: We rented our facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: My partners rented the facility before
they brought me onto the company.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, I came and looked at the
facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 45,000 square feet, three stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just gigantic building.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, how much are you paying for
rent?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, Oh, it's like 60 grand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like $60,000 for rent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then because there was a cannabis shop
right down the street from us called the
[SPEAKER_07]: Zenibus, we figured, well, this is a no,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we'll be able to get in all day long.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got licensing came fast from the
government within reason, like six months
[SPEAKER_07]: fast, but the city of Delta decided that
they were going to do a case by case study
[SPEAKER_07]: on each company that wanted to bring
cannabis to their, to their city,
[SPEAKER_07]: because they were convinced that what we
were really going to do is take the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis out of the facility and go down
to the high schools and sell it for $35
[SPEAKER_07]: and eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the mentality of these people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it costs us an enormous amount of
money because they didn't give us the,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the, they're okay for us to put
a cannabis company in that building for
[SPEAKER_07]: almost two years paying $60,000 a month
rent.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can imagine Thomas, how's that for
a burn it to the ground?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what are we doing here guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Oh my God, I was so naive.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought as long as I make cash,
we should be okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as every day I've just got the
equipment operating and making hash,
[SPEAKER_07]: we should be okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the end, that company was not okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: They flailed it, fucked it right into
bankruptcy, but it still exists.
[SPEAKER_07]: My new partners, we have no debt.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, you know, no equipment debt,
no CRA debt, no partnership debt.
[SPEAKER_07]: The company is a unicorn in Canada for
processing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we still have the same facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just on one floor of the three
stories, all the equipment.
[SPEAKER_07]: The equipment's paid off and we're full up
with, you know, rosin presses from
[SPEAKER_07]: Sasquatch 55 tons.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the Sambo Creek filtration,
electroplasmatic dry sifting unit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the Whistler 300, WT 300 washing
equipment.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a ton of, well, not a ton,
but like three XL resonators with a
[SPEAKER_07]: walk-in freezer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have the ability to get a lot of
stuff done without those crucial mistakes
[SPEAKER_07]: that were made by early companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And wow, did we ever see it a lot in
Canada?
[SPEAKER_07]: And you got to think like that's people's
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's not just like some dude
like burning it to the ground because he's
[SPEAKER_07]: incompetent.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like, it's an entire team of people
all from what I saw.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not like they were all terrible
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just seemed like they were coming from
corporate America or corporate North
[SPEAKER_07]: America because they were all Canadians
and bringing all the things that they
[SPEAKER_07]: learned the marketing people were like,
we're going to bring all the things we
[SPEAKER_07]: learned at marketing school.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I would try to tell them you
can't, it won't work that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't come across as authentic.
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually have to, you're going to have
to start anew with your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an opportunity for you to pioneer
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can take the little gems that you
brought from your education, but what
[SPEAKER_07]: you're going to need to do is you're going
to need to shift your perspective and
[SPEAKER_07]: apply something new and novel to how you
bring this to the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've seen little bits of it happen,
but for the most part, there's highly
[SPEAKER_07]: regulated rules that say, you know,
this is what your package can look like.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, in America, it looks so much
nicer, but in Canada, that's what you get.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is a totally different
product, totally different product in
[SPEAKER_07]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine like that is insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: People go into stores, they don't
recognize the products at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're kind of like, so there's still,
we're not under prohibition the same way
[SPEAKER_07]: as we were, but they're still stifling.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're still like, let's see what key,
like I swear they must've had a think tank
[SPEAKER_07]: of brilliant people because they could not
have accidentally fucked this up this bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: This absolutely has to be on purpose.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a paranoid delusional person.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying that these people,
government officials and the people that
[SPEAKER_07]: are passing these regulations really
don't, Health Canada, less than two years
[SPEAKER_07]: ago in Canada said, we still believe
there's no medical factor and there's no
[SPEAKER_07]: medical aspects of cannabis in any way
while interacting with the human body.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they made a statement, even though
they have a medical platform all across,
[SPEAKER_07]: one of the only federal medical platforms
in the whole world, you know, one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: first, and yet they still don't
acknowledge it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably need another dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say that, you know,
that's like in California, California is
[SPEAKER_05]: like the fifth largest economy in the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Agriculture is a huge component of the
economy here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had, we have a serious heritage
legacy with cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the story, the worldwide story and
California dropped the ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's almost like, it's impossible to
think they dropped the ball that much,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like, and I'm not a conspiracy
person at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, but I think it is a weird,
it's super fucking complicated,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and I do get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That nobody really understood what to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think your point about the
leadership that we didn't, there was no,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, I have this, like you could think of
a company like a car company or some
[SPEAKER_05]: invention, it starts with like the
founder, it builds, it becomes bigger and
[SPEAKER_05]: bigger, and then it becomes a giant
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then maybe someone else takes it over,
like the outside influence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you could build, you could build a
manufacturing company and then 30 years
[SPEAKER_05]: later, you're super successful and your
new CEO is from insurance or entertainment
[SPEAKER_05]: or whatever, or the CFO.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you bring in this other guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we, as an industry, we brought in that
guy from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as we transitioned, all the
leadership across the board was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, we need business specialist guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need people who know how to do
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: But none of them were ground up cannabis
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of them understood cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them made really bad decisions
and influenced policy in a big way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And no one, no one really predicted what,
no one ever thought what would happen if
[SPEAKER_05]: prohibition didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is cannabis really worth?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the real value of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just to people as a medicine,
but the commodity to the farmer,
[SPEAKER_05]: the manufacturer, the distributor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody thought like what's a real number.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that's the real number,
then that's the number we're all headed
[SPEAKER_05]: towards.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we're all headed towards that
number, then how do we transition from
[SPEAKER_05]: where right now it's 3000 bucks a pound,
but it should probably be 100 or 200 bucks
[SPEAKER_05]: a pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're paying $8 a square foot for
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The state shouldn't have allowed that
because, and then you're paying a half a
[SPEAKER_05]: million dollars for a license and spending
$80,000 a month on rent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like the state, the ag state should
have like had the foresight to say,
[SPEAKER_05]: look, in order to transition out of
prohibition, we got to be realistic with
[SPEAKER_05]: people about what their opportunities are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because everyone, everyone wanted to
transition out of prohibition and not have
[SPEAKER_07]: jail anymore, but nobody wanted to let
that prohibition dollar go.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that prohibition dollar,
the people came in, they were like,
[SPEAKER_07]: all right, we're going to legalize this
and we're going to change everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute, Bill, let's not change the
prohibition dollar.
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to make sense getting,
you know, say 3000 us dollars a pound,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is like 4,500 Canadian that is like,
we're growing it for like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: in the nineties, maybe 2000, you know,
1500.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the profit margin of weed from Canada
to America was just astronomical.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it was that way because if you got
caught, depending on the state,
[SPEAKER_07]: you were probably doing like a five or a
10 year sentence, depending on where you
[SPEAKER_07]: got caught, the higher, the money amount,
like if you're going down to Arkansas and
[SPEAKER_07]: getting 6,200, well, you're definitely
doing the 10 if you get caught,
[SPEAKER_07]: like even with like a zip, let alone,
you know, a hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it made sense in the, in a sense,
it didn't really, but it made sense in the
[SPEAKER_07]: sense that this horrific jail sentence was
the reward or the, the anti reward,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, of making this enormous amount
of money.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got rid of the jail sentence.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then suddenly the, they wanted to keep
the same prices.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The algorithm, the algorithm changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the funny thing is the corporate guys
who first, the first rush, the first wave,
[SPEAKER_05]: they were chasing that prohibition dollar
because they didn't come ag.
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't ag tech people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't people who were
ethnobotanists.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't really understand cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were like, Oh fuck man.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of money being made.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if it's 500 bucks a pound,
we're still making crazy money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now the can costs more than what's
inside the can.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about even crazier?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll, I'll step it up for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I go to cannabis stores and I try to
explain to everyone, cause all the
[SPEAKER_07]: corporate people want the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, we need to stabilize and
shelf ready these products.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, Oh, you want us to take a
volatile compound and stabilize them for
[SPEAKER_07]: the shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that I don't know a ton about a ton,
but that sounds very difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then what do they do?
[SPEAKER_07]: You go to the store and the only thing
that is being made cold are 10 milligrams
[SPEAKER_07]: shots of distillate nano emulsified into a
beverage in a little can sitting in the
[SPEAKER_07]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like looking at all the hash at
room temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at all the weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to explain to them that all of
your volatile compounds, they're,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're, they're, they're boiling right
now at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're, Oh yeah, the vote smells
amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no, no, the, and the companies
are so new that they've gone so big so
[SPEAKER_07]: fast that they're not growing exceptional
cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are, some are doing a great job,
but many are not.
[SPEAKER_07]: So already you have the disadvantage of
the, the volatile organic compounds are
[SPEAKER_07]: already in smaller amounts than they would
have been had they been grown more
[SPEAKER_07]: properly by better people under better
conditions with better cultivars.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and now they're boiling those off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, dude, it's only 1.5% as it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: By the time the guy gets it and he it's
dry and the terpenes and all these
[SPEAKER_07]: beautiful volatile have boiled off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the same experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, that's where you get people
being a little bit disgruntled with,
[SPEAKER_07]: with their purchase.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's come a long way in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say there's a lot more companies
that are sort of on the par for producing
[SPEAKER_07]: nice things.
[SPEAKER_07]: People from the black and gray market that
have transitioned over and understand that
[SPEAKER_07]: growing smaller amounts is probably a
better option.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a better idea than trying to grow,
you know, a million square feet when the
[SPEAKER_07]: only thing you've ever grown is fucking
chickpeas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were talking about,
just about government screwing things up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy to see what's happening in
Germany right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, boy, if they like, they have just
really screwed everything up where I think
[SPEAKER_02]: they're basically limiting or limiting
people to only be able to do like 55 light
[SPEAKER_02]: shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget how many people they can do it
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you have to extend groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, we've been talking with multiple people
out there and it just, it just sounds like
[SPEAKER_02]: such a headache and just such a bad idea,
a bunch of real bad ideas that aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be sustainable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who would have thought that the Germans
would come up with a bureaucratic
[SPEAKER_07]: nightmare for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I would have never thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: So weird, like a weird, it's like,
it's like a Spain weird hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a club membership based thing
they want to do in Germany.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: A quota based perk patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's impossible for any businesses
to make money really.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're like, I think the logic was
like, well, we'll figure out a way for you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys to smoke weed, but no one gets to
make money off it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: They figure it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They figure it out to make it be like,
if you do the numbers and I can't remember
[SPEAKER_07]: the exact numbers, it's like five keys a
month or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or some small amount.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do the math, you're allowed to have
a certain amount of members, 200 members
[SPEAKER_07]: or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're allowed to buy a maximum amount of
cannabis twice a month.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you do the max numbers and all of
those guys are buying, then it's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: okay, this is an okay little business.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the problem is, is unless you're
producing great cannabis, they're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be a part of other groups.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to get cannabis from a
multitude of places.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll dilute your sales.
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't be selling a hundred percent and
your numbers already small.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like, uh, and then they're all,
they're all investing in their own grows,
[SPEAKER_07]: which from, you know, the grand master LED
perspective is like, woohoo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like instead of just like a bunch of big
companies coming in, it's literally going
[SPEAKER_07]: to be like, I think they put the cap at
10,000 and I couldn't be wrong,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I thought I heard when we were in
Berlin, that they're going to allow 10,000
[SPEAKER_07]: private clubs, uh, throughout Germany,
be growing their own weed, processing
[SPEAKER_07]: their own hats and selling it to their own
private members.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a, that's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think 10,000 people are going to
find success in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want you all taking a dab right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want Brian to tell me about what his
best hash dash Rosin is that he's,
[SPEAKER_07]: that he's growing and smoking right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I, I miss your deep radio voice
describing in detail Rosins and hashes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grabbed a couple just in case we're
talking about that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, this is Rosin form, but this is
some lime peels.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm calling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend, uh, Jacob have hash friend
bred this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shared some breeding technique in my
last year out in Humboldt, which was eight
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: We worked together in the field and he
sent me some seeds he made a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: years back and this was a lemon peel by a
lemon peel again on, on ghost train,
[SPEAKER_04]: banana sherbert by Z face that like really
creative he made.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's super duper loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like can't wait to share it with him back.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, there's a look.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to smell through the computer,
but it's definitely like you stepped on
[SPEAKER_04]: some like gassy lime peels and it's right
in your face.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the taste is almost louder than the
smell on this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the translation is almost overboard
out of your ears.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really on the taste that even from
the smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm liking this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a really good sativa kick to in
that profile, but lemon G on the I-95
[SPEAKER_04]: shines in this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm liking that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stick to my gas mask heavy, and then I
just did finish, um, while breeding and
[SPEAKER_04]: working with my new 207 headband kind of
threw back to the old East coast headband
[SPEAKER_04]: clone I came into when I was first moving
back here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of on the gas ticket as usual,
but working with some, I got a whole list
[SPEAKER_04]: of interesting new ones coming up to talk
about when the time's right, but I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to hear, I want to hear about every
one of them for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you holding the jar in your hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got a few new ones I'm turning
that is I got a strawberry headband I made
[SPEAKER_04]: for my strawberry Midas into the headband
clone I call strawberry headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I crossed that into the gas mask for a
strawberry gas mask.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also am like checking females outside on
these projects right now and seeing which
[SPEAKER_04]: ones shine, which ones keep or make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got a, like the strawberry
headband lines into some different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it just shines so well outside last
year is actually most of that reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did a sour banana sherbert on the
strawberry headband for like a straw Nana
[SPEAKER_04]: band type of thing, like an, you know,
contemporary straw Nana.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got that citrus smoothie, which is the
comes that's what the line feels.
[SPEAKER_04]: I named the Fino, but it's actually his
creation is called citrus smoothie,
[SPEAKER_04]: Jacob, the half hash creation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm tying that like, yeah, like a male
in that shine, the same lemon G profile on
[SPEAKER_04]: me, like the, the lemon peel profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm working those on the yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to see, like we talked about this,
I think a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I see a really good resistance kick on
the lemon or the lemonine terpene out into
[SPEAKER_04]: Maine as far as like health carry through
the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got some different, interesting gas
mask on GMO is a new one that I'm really
[SPEAKER_04]: working with calling gasmo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that one popped up one that said that
skunk man would like Sam would like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I got like a really skunky Fino on that
one and one that lean more towards the
[SPEAKER_04]: GMO.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of them just, or one of them dumps
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only imagine the other Fino next
time we wash it, we'll, we'll do the same,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could go on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all kinds of that love for the,
for the strain work and just trying to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I just love how you articulate
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, you can just tell and hear the
passion in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can hear the, like, this guy has
not only grown and touched and like
[SPEAKER_07]: experienced the expression of this plant,
he's also like processed it and,
[SPEAKER_07]: and, and dabbed it out on all levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and you're able to articulate that in
a really good way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm telling you, I, I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask you about the East coast
headband?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I have a, I have a kind of strange
relationship with headband just real
[SPEAKER_05]: quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: My good friend, I think he's known in the,
in the, on the social media as Manny in
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole story of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the guy who put the seed in the
ground, but in the pot, he wasn't the,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's a long story.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he, he's a close friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when he came out to the West coast in
the late nineties, I did a swap with him,
[SPEAKER_05]: with sour diesel and Kush before it was
called OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did a trade and I gave the OG guys,
the sour for the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I gave the sour guys, the OG for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And long story, crazy story short,
but when he was up in the Bay area,
[SPEAKER_05]: seven Oh seven, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: First he was up in Mendo area,
but when he was in Sonoma, I told them not
[SPEAKER_05]: to, I suggested not calling the OG OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get Kush because it was a weird,
a weird time in the scene, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: not that many people had that cut at the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just a little bit volatile and
just the weird money element around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, he called it headband.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where the seven Oh seven headband
came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole story was that when he back
in the East coast, when he was a kid in
[SPEAKER_05]: the eighties, you know, late eighties,
early nineties, they used to use the term
[SPEAKER_05]: headband as a descriptor for like a
certain effect, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we, we've all had, you know, that rubber
band coming off your head.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so, so the question I had to him,
and I've asked this of other people who
[SPEAKER_05]: were on that scene back in the day is was
there ever a real, was there ever a cut
[SPEAKER_05]: ever called headband that survived through
that transition?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because from what I know, everything
that's called headband today came from
[SPEAKER_05]: that renaming of OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was selling OG and sour at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of it was called headband and
some of it was seated and some of it was
[SPEAKER_05]: just OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've always been trying to chase like,
if anyone can have an origin of an
[SPEAKER_05]: original East coast headband cut that
predates like 99, 2000 era, it's a great
[SPEAKER_05]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of around Kim dog and OG and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are great pieces you're throwing in
right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the history.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think like it's none of it's well,
it's written down when none of it's locked
[SPEAKER_04]: in, you know, written into stone where a
lot of pieces move with the OG story and
[SPEAKER_04]: the sour diesel story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only really know like what my history
line with it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And definitely raised up on that real ECSD
cut that I've heard sourced back to the
[SPEAKER_04]: Albany called such things.
[SPEAKER_04]: This had been, when I was out West,
I lived, in NorCal and did this work
[SPEAKER_04]: medical work for 11 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to touch some really good
genetics out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I did work through a different,
a batch of pushes to get to that true OG
[SPEAKER_04]: cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called out of Southern Humboldt
circulation from Oakster dam or Oakland
[SPEAKER_04]: area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really loved that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say as far as the headband out
West, I tried the 707 and maybe another
[SPEAKER_04]: Lumpica or something, a couple,
few of them that like my glass blow or
[SPEAKER_04]: friends up in Arcata were in love with
that 707 and a couple of variations that
[SPEAKER_04]: were more Cush sided out there that I
noticed, definitely more OG sided.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when I moved back here,
I just had a friend kind of bless me with
[SPEAKER_04]: some plants when I stepped into in the
first light doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a super lemon haze cut that
was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was this headband cut just
reported to me as it moved through the
[SPEAKER_04]: lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: People shared it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was definitely like East coast heavy
headband cut that some people reported to
[SPEAKER_04]: be possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly what's termed or original diesel
or the day wrecker that's been thrown in
[SPEAKER_04]: the mix with it, which it might be that
same synonymous, same cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what I noticed part of the story
as well, when I first went out West myself
[SPEAKER_04]: in 06, 06, 07, I had a friend from out
East doing work out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grabbed a cutting from Vermont.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were in Maine, but he called it all
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He called it East coast, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was not the Albany cut that I was
used to, but it was so dank like peanut
[SPEAKER_04]: butter, fudgy, thick, like not your mass
super skunk as much cited.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more thick, like a Kush thickness
to it versus, you know, the ECSD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that was East coast,
that was sour diesel, them East coast,
[SPEAKER_04]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I heard other people out there
when I was in working in, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Santa Rosa Sonoma area with some
actually a market, like a farmer's market
[SPEAKER_04]: and such, some people had some clones and
some medicine or some flour of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people termed it the mistress
cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've heard that one
thrown around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the sour diesel you cheat on your
other sour diesel with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: There could be another story attached to
the mistress cut, but that's maybe getting
[SPEAKER_05]: a little too personal.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but that's a really interesting story
because I think, so the first time I
[SPEAKER_05]: showed these guys the OG around 98,
99, they took a look at it and go,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where'd you get diesel?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, like, and these are the sour
diesel guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, you mean sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, no, no, no, diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause sour diesel is just Kim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour diesel is just sour Kim.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they just change it to diesel
because diesel was a popular, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be one I think I can ask about,
cause you have some of this folklore,
[SPEAKER_04]: the store, my friends that circulated
around the first early cuttings,
[SPEAKER_04]: like 99, 2000, even 2001 that came around
for us back then years later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I came back, a friend of mine said
that he had heard the sour diesel story
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out of this, you know, the East
coast side actually pertaining more to
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was diesel was like a term,
like you're saying that referred to like
[SPEAKER_04]: strength power.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, you know, that power house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what I heard is the sour got
flipped onto it because if you had that
[SPEAKER_04]: real cut of that diesel, then other crews
were sour over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard that one a lot?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's soured relationships.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was originally, it was the first
seeds were from Kim dog and it's unknown
[SPEAKER_05]: male for two to two generations,
basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the whole mass super, super skunk side,
nobody really knows, but the seeds were as
[SPEAKER_05]: far as I remember, you know, and my memory
fades, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just, it was our Kim on the seed pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the little film box.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they put the S in front of our
Kim.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was sour Kim.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, and then once it, because it was
Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once it hit the market,
when people started purchasing it,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was like, Oh, it sells.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll sell it as sour diesel because
diesel is like chronic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like saying fire, you know,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was waiting for the PIF to get
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't worked with any of that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any variation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just have a nice little download on
the stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Molly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it, is it really supposed to be PIF is
just a, is a, I'm supposed to be purple,
[SPEAKER_05]: purple haze, purple haze, purple haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw this on some video that the PIF,
they call it the PIF because the Dominican
[SPEAKER_05]: guys that were selling haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're calling it purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was NL five haze, but they were calling
it purple haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause haze and purple haze just were
attached and the guys who were hearing it
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't get the accent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's just an internet
story, but I've always wondered where the
[SPEAKER_05]: word PIF come from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to know the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: How to get those Miami guys in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all, we called it haze back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then PIF came later for me,
actually, after I moved back even five
[SPEAKER_07]: years ago, it was always haze for us,
us up in, in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it was that that's what it was
18 plus week flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big monster plants, little tiny buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, I was so lucky to truly that as much
of a commercial grower, as my mentor,
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron Hickey was, cause he was just all
about like building these like secret rows
[SPEAKER_07]: and houses all across.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was also, you know, one that would be
like, let's just grow this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's 20 weeks of flowering and just
like, people would be like, Whoa,
[SPEAKER_07]: what are you talking about Ron?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we could hammer off like three crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we can't, we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Oh, we're, he'd be like,
Oh, we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that weed was just so spectacular to
have that in my history of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people would come into the room
and they'd be like, they'd think it was
[SPEAKER_07]: like perfume, like literally just on their
tongue, in their mouths, down their
[SPEAKER_07]: throats.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what is that perfumey smell?
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's the haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in fact, this is an amazing thing
because my wife is not a huge proponent of
[SPEAKER_07]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a cannabis, obviously she has an
appreciation for the fact that it's been
[SPEAKER_07]: funding our life for the last 35 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she has her own relationships with
wearing hemp and CBD and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, just not overly a huge cannabis
proponent.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when my first son was born and we
named him Tosh, she suggested that we use
[SPEAKER_07]: the name Hayes for his middle name,
which in fact is his name.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's Tosh Hayes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just thought that was such a cool
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I even asked her later, I was like,
what made you do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what made you say that?
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's like, you would always just get
so excited about the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to transfer a little bit of that
over to our son.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hayes, it's the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how excited we would be.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys know, I'm sure you're the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife did the exact same thing with my
son.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so weird you said that, man,
because she was, she suggests my son's
[SPEAKER_05]: middle name is Sage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my wife is not a smoker and she like,
it didn't even really like, she doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: even like follow the whole heritage of me
as a breeder and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a big part of our lives and our
narrative.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, well, what about the words?
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Sage?
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that a cool?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, honey, you realize that it's
kind of weird for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, just do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, yeah, but it's a cool name.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really cool name.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, dude, listen, that is
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you bred both of those Sages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's right, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the Sage breeder.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sage breeder on multiple fronts.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is super cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the wife and how cool they
are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't do it without them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Couldn't do it without them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, man, what a nice chill out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been about an hour so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good for a little bit more and puff
some bowls and missing Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping that everything is OK with him
and that maybe he just maybe had some
[SPEAKER_07]: family or something else going on that he
couldn't make it today.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to hear from each and every one
of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Rob was just out there for his
birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Living the birthday life.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I could go and travel around for
people's birthdays.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob is the compliment traveler.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always the traveler.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kept it consistent, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did not slow down as he got older.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just like, I'll just keep visiting
countries.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll never forget really that it kind of
blew my mind that he had this apartment
[SPEAKER_07]: that he didn't really live in,
but it just held like boxes of all of his
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was always just like, dude, that is
neat.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't count the amount of times that
I would go visit him at that apartment
[SPEAKER_07]: deal going on the Oscar out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he would have just gotten back from
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'd have all these crazy tools from
harvesting hemp in Vietnam and cloths and
[SPEAKER_07]: beads.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just going through Rob's stuff with
Rob was one of my coolest memories of
[SPEAKER_07]: hanging out and getting to know Rob.
[SPEAKER_07]: You really get to know that guy when you
let him go through the stuff that he's
[SPEAKER_07]: collected around the world and sort of
express his passion that he has.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for the weeds and the culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, I'm attracted to passion.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really have an attraction to passion.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't even have to be passionate
about something that I personally love.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's palpable and the person is just
truly authentic in their passion for the
[SPEAKER_07]: thing they're sharing with you,
it's a pretty lovely experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if more people put their phones
down, in fact, and hung out with people
[SPEAKER_07]: next to each other, rather than,
sorry, what were you saying here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did you see this?
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to check this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I don't want to check that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to relax and connect and cough some
dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thomas, are you going to tell us about the
UVC lights a little bit?
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like we should probably talk about
that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I can actually... Let me start it
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'll start off is how... Thomas I've
known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's Grandmaster LED.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a popular YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_07]: He has lots of traction.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's always been doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was only about a year ago he was
reaching out to me on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a terrible way to reach out to me
for anyone that wants to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's much easier to just hit me up on my
bcbubbleman at icloud.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find it almost in all my social
medias.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he hit me up on Instagram and I get so
many messages on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not always quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had sent me maybe three or four
messages and I hadn't gotten back to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like, I have something... The
messages were like, I have something
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to check this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I got to get back to this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to get back to this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lose the messages in the list.
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally get back to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, I got this light that kills
bugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, okay, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he starts telling me about this UVC
light.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, he got me hooked.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will admit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to go and photograph the garden that
he showed, which was full of... I think
[SPEAKER_07]: the first one he showed was full of
thrips.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a grower, I haven't been growing
every day for the last 35 years,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I started growing almost 35 years ago
and I've grown some crops and I know what
[SPEAKER_07]: it looks like when you get bugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know how devastating it is when the
plants look the way they looked when he
[SPEAKER_07]: showed the crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: With the thrips.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he showed a crop, you know,
the same crop later.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was 30 or 40 days
later.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was when he really first got the
light and didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still a lot to learn about this
light.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he was using it for very, very short
intervals.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like five minutes a day on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're just little five watt strip
lights that point up under the canopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they disrupt these bugs in a big way.
[SPEAKER_07]: What were the other ones?
[SPEAKER_07]: The aphids.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were like literally running away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Thomas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you spotlight or pin my video here and
I'll hit play.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let me see how I can do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spotlight for everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is actually like the thrips in my
own medical garden on the very first day
[SPEAKER_02]: that I was testing them out myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's like really crazy about this is,
well, before I'd even started this,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had already done tests and been totally
successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were taking basically a tent,
taking just like one plant and introducing
[SPEAKER_02]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started off our very first test were
spider mites, where we're introducing five
[SPEAKER_02]: to seven mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within seven days, we're completely
beating them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm talking like at this point,
I thought, OK, I can beat spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also beating thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was only like on an individual
plant with like one or two thrips and or
[SPEAKER_02]: with only like five or seven mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was the first thing where we
actually have an actual thrip infestation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see how they're just like bars
that go underneath your canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're only five watts each.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were only doing five minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just trying to think right now at this
point, we were only doing that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five minute treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is actually going to jump 10 days
later of doing five minute treatments and
[SPEAKER_02]: seven or three days before this footage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we have about 15 hours worth of
footage crammed into about 15 minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But three days before this, I cleaned the
bottoms up and I moved the lights up and I
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't really find any thrips or thrip
damage at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right before I took this footage,
I had found thrips in the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to show it in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one area where I didn't strip the
leaves, like I totally forgot to strip the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like the one area where the
lights not retreating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was on the at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like basically the footage is just trying
to show like you can't really hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't hide the damage that thrips do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has like almost like a slug paste that
goes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where this is right where I
found him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see I moved the light into the
corner right before I had taken the
[SPEAKER_02]: footage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see they went right into the
corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the crop went on, I thought like I
considered it 97 to 98% protection because
[SPEAKER_02]: we couldn't kill them or beat them at five
minutes a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you couldn't see a trace of any damage
in the top 30 plus inches, which to me was
[SPEAKER_02]: beating them because you can't normally
beat them and they will just spread like
[SPEAKER_02]: just insanely fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, we started then wanting to use
UV to stress out the plant because UVA and
[SPEAKER_02]: UVB have been or UVA is commonly used to
like enhance THC and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, UVB, there's a lot of
evidence that it works a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we started, you know, UBC has a
much higher efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started doing two 15 minute
treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And six days later, the thrips were
completely gone from the room,
[SPEAKER_02]: completely just like you could not find a
trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: We we flew Matthew Gates out from
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like an IPM specialist just to see if
he could find any.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just kind of mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We accidentally... Dude, I came out there
with my macro fucking lens and
[SPEAKER_07]: photographed that crop looking for thrips
or any type of bug.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the macro photographs.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a bug.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no bug shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no sign of any bugs, which was the
thing that caught my attention.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my full circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just kind of mind blowing to
kind of see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we didn't even end up beating them
until like the sixth week and when we were
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to enhance THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point right now, this is
another shipping container I have where I
[SPEAKER_02]: had three tents and there was another lab
that participated with this and then
[SPEAKER_02]: someone else in Michigan and someone else
in Oregon where we're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this point, when I was developing
this, there was all different types of UVC
[SPEAKER_02]: diodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have different types of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have kind of different types of
wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were trying to determine what is
going to be the most effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were also using different diode
counts and we were running different
[SPEAKER_02]: milliamps through the diodes, just kind of
developing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, this is when we were
testing spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, this is when we're
taking... Like on our very first test,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're taking five to seven spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're taking hundreds of spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with Lima being leaves that have eggs
and letting them establish for hours while
[SPEAKER_02]: these ones, what you're looking at right
now, this leaf was clean 12 hours ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've had 12 hours to like what you
can see the damage of what they've done in
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty mind blowing what they can
do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It hurts my soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then all the footage that you're
seeing, they had 36 hours to establish
[SPEAKER_02]: like, well, this is at the 12 hour mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with this treatment, before we
actually started using the light,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had 36 hours to establish and we
started doing 10 minute treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like we're about to do a whole bunch
of more testing on spider mites,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's still pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is seven days later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can remember what they did to those
leaves in the first 12 hours and we can
[SPEAKER_02]: come to the very top leaf and it's totally
clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like they're still alive on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the simple fact that after they get
treated, they get suppressed and they just
[SPEAKER_02]: start walking around almost aimlessly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the adults are they're on the
plant and they're but a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not doing setting up shop what
they normally do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It screws with their DNA and their RNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we have a unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working with a university that is
assisting with the white paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have all the science on it
yet, but we do know that it just it
[SPEAKER_02]: totally disrupts them without question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's slowing the spread down by 90 to 95
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not to say that when we with
two 15 minute treatments that we like we
[SPEAKER_02]: have a chance to still potentially beat
them because we couldn't like 10 minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: treatments could not like we couldn't beat
thrips with two 10 minute or with a 10
[SPEAKER_02]: minute treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But two 15 minute treatments, we
absolutely can beat them where they are
[SPEAKER_02]: completely gone, eradicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right behind here, you can see these
are kale plants that have hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: regular aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we it's within a couple of days,
you can see that there's like a trail of
[SPEAKER_02]: them leaving and dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's extremely it has a very high
efficacy on aphids within 14 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over 90 percent of them are dead on the
plant, just right in their tracks breaking
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will say the first crop that he
showed, which was that death baba with the
[SPEAKER_07]: thrips, I went there, I photographed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we harvested it, he harvested it and
we ran it through bubble bags in my living
[SPEAKER_07]: room, because I just wanted to see to me,
it didn't seem possible that a plant could
[SPEAKER_07]: get that out of an infestation and not be
drastically affected in its yield and or
[SPEAKER_07]: quality and caliber of resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it came out like five star resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we I think we got about 22 or 23
percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the yield was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: The quality was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that that was really sort of the the
nudge I needed to be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: This seems I just remember being a young
grower and how I mean, listen,
[SPEAKER_07]: from the perspective of like even food
production, peppers and all these other
[SPEAKER_07]: different things like this is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty insane when you think about it now,
obviously, I have always concerns about
[SPEAKER_07]: disruption of DNA and RNA, and I wouldn't
want to be in the room while this thing is
[SPEAKER_07]: on Thomas suggests.
[SPEAKER_07]: That you're not in the room while it's on
because you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this can cause cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you absolutely don't want to be
anywhere near this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to use it in the middle of
the darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we came across an article
that kind of led to everything and how
[SPEAKER_02]: everything developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bugs are attracted to light in the
middle of darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though you be five watts might to
our human eye doesn't look like very much
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not enough to disrupt the plant
sleeping, but it's a lot to an insect and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's enough for them to be kind of like
attracted in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really exciting here is what we
haven't discussed yet is we had a timer
[SPEAKER_02]: failure that led to another really
incredible discovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have like I already brought up
that people it's commonly known that
[SPEAKER_02]: people use UVA to enhance THC and
terpenes, which UVA is basically like a
[SPEAKER_02]: blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's three fifteen nanometer to four
hundred nanometer wavelength.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, going back almost seven
years ago, I saw a whole bunch of people
[SPEAKER_02]: that participated when they're going going
and using UVA against UVB.
[SPEAKER_02]: UVB is two eighty to three fifteen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw like a like the UVA there was
almost no gain, but the UVB there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge gain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we knew with UVC with like one hundred
nanometer to two hundred and eighty
[SPEAKER_02]: nanometer that there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's going to have the highest
efficacy for hurting or doing damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, we had a timer fail and came
in the room and the plants, every part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant was completely fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so that's when we learned that the
light can be systemically admitted into
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something that we're going to
be playing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also really good that this actually
happened because we realized like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, oh, my goodness, if someone has a
timer failure, they could kill their crop
[SPEAKER_02]: with these lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to develop our driver.
[SPEAKER_02]: The MCU and the driver so it can only run
for 15 minutes at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I don't really have too much more
than that on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, simple fact that we're developing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a utility patent, too,
on how it mounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I believe in two years from now,
anybody that's doing commercial growing
[SPEAKER_02]: will be using it or like a knockoff of it
because it breaks the rules of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all it's also the very first EPA
certified pesticide light in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thomas, can I ask you can I ask you a
question about how is it is it drawing
[SPEAKER_05]: because you said a small amount of light
to attract insects.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it drawing the plants to the UV and
then the UV is having the effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I definitely draws it to them and
then it's screwing them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like we were confused by the science
when we absolutely like eradicated them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first time like when I thought
that it was, you know, stopping them from
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to reproduce initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was thinking, OK, it's taken us five
or six weeks to get to this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now all of a sudden they're gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then and here's another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the very first test, we were also
moving the lights up to get it as close as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible to anywhere where it was
infected, where on the following crop we
[SPEAKER_02]: realized we didn't have to even move the
lights up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just ran it for those two 15 minute
cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like they were gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I definitely think that they are
attracted to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say I can't say just all the
science behind it, but all I can say is
[SPEAKER_02]: that 100 percent eradicates thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I actually believe that spider
mites it's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we we already have like 90 to 95
percent protection with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if like two 15 minute
treatments could have a similar effect on
[SPEAKER_02]: like as it is to thrips and, you know,
thrips and spider mites are what I would
[SPEAKER_02]: consider the two biggest pests and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, there's a lot of, you know,
fungus gnats and aphids and obviously root
[SPEAKER_02]: aphids are another kind of level and broad
mites and russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually believe it would be very
effective against broad mites and russet
[SPEAKER_02]: mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with root aphids is they can
stay their whole life in the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if they're a full adult.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the idea that as a preventative,
you know, like for sure, there's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be people initially that are like,
I got an infestation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go out and get these lights
and blast it hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I like it more as a just have
them in your room.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're five minutes twice a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just preventative.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you said, Thomas, it's not like
you're going to get 20,000 spider mites at
[SPEAKER_07]: once.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be like a few.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you've got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it also someone's I saw someone in
the comments asked about mold and it will
[SPEAKER_02]: factually kill mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you could put it right in front of
mildew and it will kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not going to kill or solve a
mildew problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a mildew problem is like if you're
for example, if your VPD is totally way
[SPEAKER_02]: off, the biggest reason why people get
mildew, in my opinion, is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: nighttime, the cycle, it gets too cold
with your humidity that gets too high and
[SPEAKER_02]: you get a dew point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like how it's it can't can't
fix or it's not going to solve something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, it definitely is going to
fight and help microbials, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like the ultimate like it
works to enhance THC and terrapins.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fights mold and it fights bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for such a low wattage and like,
let's be realistic, even using 10 watts
[SPEAKER_02]: for 30 minutes a day is not going to make
it's not going to change anybody's bill,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically.
Perlite.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're tiny, tiny little little
dodgers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always interested in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, obviously, my all time favorite is
outdoor, regenerative, organic,
[SPEAKER_07]: like that's that's that's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do love the fact that like,
I've even grown some incredible cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: like just indoors, just with food that I
bought at the store.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was an organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I used like what was that shit
called earth juice, I think was something
[SPEAKER_07]: I used like 25 years ago or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just not like fish emulsions and other
like death tea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Open that shit up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone was like, oh, my God,
did someone die in here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, no, man, it's my earth juice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to put a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit, I got some on my hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to smell for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But concentrated like really strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was super concentrated.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would come out like like a little did
not pour very well that earth juice,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially if it aged for any amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I was meaning was I still
appreciate cannabis expressed in all these
[SPEAKER_07]: different ways, obviously.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a big fan of cannabis that's been
sprayed by deadly chemicals because I am
[SPEAKER_07]: going to vaporize the materials and inhale
them into my lungs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, organic is definitely it's
crazy that we have to use a word for just
[SPEAKER_07]: normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, no, no, it's organic, organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, no, it can't be like it has to
be more expensive to buy chemicals and
[SPEAKER_07]: spray them all over your plant than to not
put chemicals on your plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what kind of fucking crazy
world we're living in.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Bizarro world that Mojave was talking
about earlier, where they just subsidize
[SPEAKER_07]: things so that it makes no sense in the
economy, because clearly what you see in
[SPEAKER_05]: scandal here in California over the last
couple of months with the.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the LA Times went and pulled
products off the shelf at a few
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensaries and had them tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: By a far more comprehensive lab than the
state mandated labs and found they were
[SPEAKER_05]: filled.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, they were filled with things that are
banned in the U.S., not just banned for
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, but banned in the entire U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had some stuff that was in the single
use potential harm realm, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: just for irritants and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and Paclobutazole, which has nothing
to do with fighting off any it's not going
[SPEAKER_05]: to kill your crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just about rock hard nugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so it was still everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically what it comes down to is in
the whole California supply chain is
[SPEAKER_05]: fucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's like illicit shit that makes
it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it gets all flopped around.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the crazy part is now they're
realizing that out of the three big
[SPEAKER_05]: distillate manufacturers in the state,
you could have as many as 80 farms
[SPEAKER_05]: contributing to one vape pen because
they're literally dumping it all in the
[SPEAKER_05]: big back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if one out of the 80 farms is a
dirty player, which there were and there
[SPEAKER_05]: probably were more than one out of the 80.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just the idea that we've gotten to
this point where it's this big giant,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, corn syrup world that we live
in, you know, high fructose corn syrup
[SPEAKER_05]: that came from how many different corn
fields and the fact that there's still the
[SPEAKER_05]: greed element is a big part of it and
failing farms and all the problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone's like, oh, I got to make
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reality is, you know, and the sad
part was, you know, the DCC had just done
[SPEAKER_05]: a five million dollar campaign to show DC
is the Department of Cannabis Control use
[SPEAKER_05]: tax money collected from cannabis revenue
to do a five million dollar campaign to
[SPEAKER_05]: show people that buying cannabis was safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could walk into a dispensary and just
like we test it and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they test it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it exposed the dirty supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also exposed that the labs aren't
necessarily testing as much as they
[SPEAKER_05]: should.
[SPEAKER_05]: It exposed that some labs don't do some
labs give you a pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, some labs will say like,
you know, hey, we'll give you a pass,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, shop with us and we give you the
highest THC numbers and we also pass your,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the whole the whole industry is all
fucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and it's kind of the fast food side of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the sun grown, you know,
family farm boutique organic thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the big commercial failed farm trim
market, you know, where people are selling
[SPEAKER_05]: five or ten dollar pounds of of trim or
moldy weed or whatever and turning it into
[SPEAKER_05]: distillate and isolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, you know, we've got a huge vape
and gummy and, you know, edible market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just it's been exposed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now shops are like going through like,
you know, a lot of a lot of customers are
[SPEAKER_05]: showing up saying, hey, is this safe?
[SPEAKER_05]: So some shops have taken it on to actually
test their own products with the expanded
[SPEAKER_05]: panel that the state doesn't mandate,
because we now know that there's things in
[SPEAKER_05]: there that they're not even testing for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just far out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, so all these years later,
you know, working in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's still a mess and there's still a lot
of people, you know, that came into this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry to make money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and the state hasn't managed the
transition well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this vape pin thing was really a big
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can look it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a L.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: Times piece and it's got a lot of
traction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why I need hash church in my life,
because I would not have been exposed to
[SPEAKER_07]: this otherwise.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm always happy to hear about things
like this and make sure that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going deeper with our own hardware
for the brand, like make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: picking and choosing the right things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, we're already on the conscious
side of things in the sense that we're not
[SPEAKER_07]: using moldy material.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not using chemically sprayed
material and we're not making distillate.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're making live hash rosin, which is,
yeah, it's so crazy how greed is such a
[SPEAKER_07]: crazy factor that it turns into these
monster scandals.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like people don't start out evil.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just they just kind of like one step
at a time as they get into a deeper hole
[SPEAKER_07]: and they need to be pulled out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, well, I can just sell all this
moldy herb to the lab and we could turn it
[SPEAKER_07]: into distillate and we can put it in with
terpenes, botanical terpenes that also
[SPEAKER_07]: have contaminations.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think when when Horatio bought
his delimiting, the contaminant was called
[SPEAKER_07]: citrus oil and it made up five percent of
what was in that five gallon drum.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a full liter of just like
orange, strange shit that he pulled out of
[SPEAKER_07]: a clear liquid, which I think you might
have helped him with, Dr. Mark,
[SPEAKER_07]: if I do so remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's a it's a good show.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what what what?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's hard to even know where to
begin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you have to begin at least.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we haven't been on hash
search too much since the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just it was never intended,
I think, when they signed the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they got snookered on seeds,
oil and rope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't I don't even think they
contemplated CBD because CBD at the time
[SPEAKER_06]: had just gotten its approval as the active
ingredient for Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was no and yeah, you the the the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act prohibits the
[SPEAKER_06]: use of FDA approved active ingredient in
food feeder cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, that means the whole CBD
industry as it exists was never
[SPEAKER_06]: contemplated because they're basically in
violation of federal law.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting because if you read that
law, it basically says for interstate
[SPEAKER_06]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess as long as you keep within a
state, I guess it's OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's where it it kind of started,
Marcus, really.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think, yeah, I mean,
this this vape pump thing is the fact that
[SPEAKER_06]: you can chemically convert CBD into THC at
about one tenth the cost of.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Mojave will tell you,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on, you know, what your
economics and your supply chain are.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when CBD has cratered to two hundred
fifty dollars a kilogram, it only adds a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit of cost to now convert that
into Delta nine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the people who were originally
converting it were converting it into
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the see all these Delta eight
products really proliferate for the most
[SPEAKER_06]: part in states where there isn't,
you know, good cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, California, again, is a notable
exception.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's a lawsuit between several
dispensaries in the Los Angeles area and
[SPEAKER_06]: these hemp manufacturers who are basically
making eight dollar disposable vape pens
[SPEAKER_06]: that, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really depends on like what your cost
of production are.
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever the cost of production is,
the hemp guys are a whole lot cheaper
[SPEAKER_06]: because they don't have the regulation and
they have a much larger addressable market
[SPEAKER_06]: as soon as they could sell on the
Internet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two clicks after saying you're 21 years
old, they're asking you for your credit
[SPEAKER_06]: card information.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, how do you compete and how do
you expect a population of people to go to
[SPEAKER_06]: the dispensary and buy stuff at the
dispensary when they could get stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: online or at a gas station?
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole lot cheaper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a lot of these places you could
still go to jail for smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the way to jail, you could stop at
the gas station and get yourself the Delta
[SPEAKER_06]: eight pen or, you know, some gummies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now that they're in gummies and
beverages, Mark, you know, like beverages
[SPEAKER_06]: is huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: What Minnesota did.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's just a patchwork of regulation
down here in the States.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what Minnesota did is the liquor
people who sell alcohol in Minnesota saw
[SPEAKER_06]: this THC beverage thing come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of a sudden they're like,
okay, liquor stores in Minnesota could
[SPEAKER_06]: sell 10 milligram CBD, you know,
cans of seltzer and pretty soda and shit
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that just opened up this huge market
because basically, you know, let's face
[SPEAKER_06]: it, we are a commodity in a commodity.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need to reduce your production
costs at all wherever you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in reduction of production costs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of the day, why am I going to
spend 10 times the amount of money to make
[SPEAKER_06]: that 10 milligrams of THC when I could
chemically convert that from cheap ass
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in my building, I'm bringing in CBD,
right, which has been made legal because
[SPEAKER_06]: of the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I'm chemically converting that or
what people really want, not CBD,
[SPEAKER_06]: THC, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the converters have gotten
sophisticated enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: So their chemistry at first was their
chemistry game wasn't as good as it should
[SPEAKER_06]: be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were basically dumping everything
into Delta eight, which is basically the
[SPEAKER_06]: thermodynamic product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Delta eight is not made by the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta eight is a debt is a regulate is a
is a degradation product, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant only makes Delta nine configured
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Delta eight that's there is
usually just in trace amounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually, I think it's just a artifact of
the measure measurement itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in that sampling of the process,
you're actually converting some Delta
[SPEAKER_06]: eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no Delta eight in the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no Delta eight made in that
biochemical pathway, only Delta nine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like Delta eight is not mentioned in
the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it created this loophole for people to
say, OK, as long as I convert my CBD into
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta eight, people get high.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can just put some sponge Bob kind of
cartoon character on some label.
[SPEAKER_06]: And next thing you know, gummies,
vape pens, soda pop, all that shit will be
[SPEAKER_06]: sold and not as a dispensary and not the
kind of products that you guys like like
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus and, you know, quality growers and
quality single source hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just THC, the molecule in some
fruity drink or some free candy that kids
[SPEAKER_06]: can eat and sneak while they're in high
school.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I think it's a real big problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's probably only possible because of
prohibition itself that this problem
[SPEAKER_06]: actually exists.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't exist if if people had access
to good quality weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wouldn't need Delta eight and HHCP
and THCP and and acetate.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a lot of people going to the
hospital because the THC acetate that's
[SPEAKER_06]: not very clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess what they now found is that
when you heat up THC acetate, it converts
[SPEAKER_06]: into something called ketene, which is
something you don't want to be breathing
[SPEAKER_06]: into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, all artificially made because of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some friends out in North Carolina
and they they're super conscious,
[SPEAKER_07]: like they grow organically, they process
everything themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do live hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're in that world.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't do the Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just literally making the you
know, they're using that that weakness in
[SPEAKER_07]: the farm bill and exploiting it to get
right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: With live hash rosin, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they do it in a way that's like,
I can't exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's the other thing is that is
that when they read the farm bill,
[SPEAKER_06]: it only references THCA or THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we all know that THCA is the precursor
to THC in the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these people are all hiding behind the
so-called loophole, sinking that somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you read the Code of Federal
Regulations, and most lawyers would,
[SPEAKER_06]: it says that you have to apply gas
chromatography, which, as you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: will decarboxylate your THCA and convert
it into THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is no real loophole there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you'll see like cookies and other
brands like this, Mark, selling THCA
[SPEAKER_06]: diamonds that gram out of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it depends like some state like
Vermont doesn't allow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't ship it into Vermont.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in certain states, you can ship that
shit over line, over state lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing that's happening is
they're taking cheap bulk hemp that's
[SPEAKER_06]: grown outdoors and they're spraying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not only spraying it, they're actually
adding THCA isolate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could actually add THCA isolate to
hemp flour and then putting it into the
[SPEAKER_06]: pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how fucked up is the market that
that's that's like throwing sand down at
[SPEAKER_06]: the beach, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So can I explain the way that they
actually do get that loophole?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the testing of the flour is a USDA
umbrella.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that has a 30-day harvest window.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you need to test 30 days before harvest
to show that you're below 0.3% delta 9.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is combined total THC,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where it gets decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're growing a 60-day variety,
I know everyone is going to like just like
[SPEAKER_05]: jaws are going to drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're growing a 60-day variety and
you send in your harvest sample at day 30,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's not a lot on the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so then you pass your delta 9 USDA
inspection, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you go to full harvest on that
plant and you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you know that you're way over on
the total THC, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you now got a right plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: USDA, it's no longer in their purview.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, all that needs to happen is that your
COA has to show that you're at 0.3% delta
[SPEAKER_05]: 9.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now the THCA number, regardless of
whether it's a total THC, it never gets
[SPEAKER_05]: decarboxylated because it's separate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now all you got to do is keep the
supply chain cold enough that your 0.3
[SPEAKER_05]: never goes over 0.3.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you can sell that all over the
place, even though your total combined
[SPEAKER_05]: could be in the 30s, it could be all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a ridiculous loophole.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all about the harvest window.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other thing that I find
interesting, because the guy Rod Knight,
[SPEAKER_05]: the attorney who's had a lot of,
he's the guy who's been kind of... Rod
[SPEAKER_06]: Knight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rod Knight, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the guy who's I think is on the
Cookies website.
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, what he says is that even
though they only mention delta 9 in the
[SPEAKER_05]: farm bill, they exclude a bunch of other
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that they put an exclusion in
there implies that it was on purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning if they excluded derivatives,
they excluded alkaloids, salts,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever other things, they said,
let's give it broad language.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're saying it's only delta 9?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all these other things?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not mention what the other things
are, but let's just say not all the other
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to remember Mojave would all do
respect that he is a paid shill for the
[SPEAKER_06]: hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy... Hey, before we get to off
point, Wade had his hand up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want him to be able to speak on what
we were talking about before we go too
[SPEAKER_07]: deep into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we can get back to the paid
shill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I just got to speak up as a
patient and a longtime advocate for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, the ready availability of
hemp products, if they are free of
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants, it's a real gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a boon to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inexpensive, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, as we've discussed,
greed comes into it and people will do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they can to create a product that
will sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happening in the California
market is the people who are good actors
[SPEAKER_00]: are being undercut and undermined by the
whole hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sad part is there are actors in
the hemp industry who are good actors,
[SPEAKER_00]: who are doing good work, who are creating
good products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know who they are for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you go into the legal market,
to what Mojave was talking about with this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing down in LA, yeah, what we're seeing
is cannabis crops showing up with
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that are not listed in the
prohibited compounds under California law.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're prohibited under federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, California didn't call them
out extra, but they're showing up in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that's in legal dispensaries
because California law doesn't require
[SPEAKER_00]: producers to test for that particular
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I'm ranting, I may not be
making a lot of sense, but to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: the real tragedy here is, again,
prohibition has created all of this crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit that is not serving anyone other
than maybe some bureaucrats who are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to keep the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, grow your own and do it
regeneratively.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your own medicine fairly
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't do it, come to Nevada
County in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of regenerative
practitioners right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Wade.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, back to the paid shill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that the point that we're all
seeing is that is it a loophole and how
[SPEAKER_05]: long are people going to profit during the
loophole?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what's going to come on the other
side?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because something will, and they'll
definitely ratify it or change it because
[SPEAKER_05]: it's kind of cuckoo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also just to follow up on what Wade
said, all the hemp products and the THCA
[SPEAKER_05]: products and the THCP and all the
different things that are sold all over LA
[SPEAKER_05]: at head shops, those are dirtier than the
products that were tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's not assume that the hemp versions
that are being sold in gas stations and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff are cleaner than the state regulated
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, we're not even being tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't even have, it's just wild,
wild west.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just kind of mess.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't even know what to say about
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a gentleman in the chat named
Dennis K.
[SPEAKER_07]: He wrote, the loophole was almost 30 pages
that defined D9 as the controlled
[SPEAKER_07]: substance.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a loophole.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an intentional act.
[SPEAKER_07]: He also mentioned while you were talking
about how to keep the numbers down,
[SPEAKER_07]: he said, I run a grow in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_07]: We test our plants at week two of flower
to get less than 0.3% THCA-delta-9,
[SPEAKER_07]: then do an independent freeze drive sample
at week nine to get a clean COA just prior
[SPEAKER_07]: to harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wanted to throw that in.
[SPEAKER_06]: He seemed to have some knowledge in
regards to... Well, so like with the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulation at harvest, the USDA's
regulation ends.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like if you wanted to produce corn and
produce cans of corn, then you would need
[SPEAKER_06]: to build a factory where your productions
of cans of corn are regulated under FDA
[SPEAKER_06]: guidelines, because you're now taking that
harvested crop and you're turning it into
[SPEAKER_06]: food, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is where the ball's been
dropped, which is that the Food and Drug
[SPEAKER_06]: Administration is supposed to regulate
crops after they're harvested,
[SPEAKER_06]: because that's where the USDA sort of
washes their hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so with no regulatory pathway that's
compliant to bring CBD products to market,
[SPEAKER_06]: what did they expect to happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: So now all this CBD was produced.
[SPEAKER_06]: The beginning of the farm bill,
a kilogram of CBD was like $7,000 a
[SPEAKER_06]: kilogram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then maybe a year later, it was about
2,000 bucks a kilogram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that same kilogram is down to $200 a
kilogram.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the conversion of CBD into THC has been
known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not a clean process, and it
depends on how well engineered that
[SPEAKER_06]: process is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna get multiple products.
[SPEAKER_06]: To say that we don't know what's in these
products is not entirely accurate,
[SPEAKER_06]: because if you look at like Josh Swider
from Affinity in San Diego for one,
[SPEAKER_06]: or Chris Hedala from Pro Verde in
Massachusetts, they'll show you on the
[SPEAKER_06]: COAs that they test for all these
non-natural isomers, not all of them,
[SPEAKER_06]: but like things like ISO Delta-8 and ISO
Delta-48.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's now certified reference materials,
so third parties can basically test for
[SPEAKER_06]: those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so people like Josh will tell you
that, yeah, I could distinguish a
[SPEAKER_06]: synthetic THC that's been chemically
derived versus a natural THC, which has
[SPEAKER_06]: been extracted from cannabis plants,
which I think is where we all wanna be.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this synthetic thing kind of popped up
because of what Wade mentioned,
[SPEAKER_06]: the one word greed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also mentioned from the fact that
they unleashed this 800 pound gorilla in
[SPEAKER_06]: the room, which is the hemp industry,
without properly contemplating how to
[SPEAKER_06]: properly regulate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's not a drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess Epidiolex is a drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's approved drug that you can get a
prescription for, that you can buy at a
[SPEAKER_06]: drug store.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's an approved drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: But cannabis, for the most part,
is a medicated herb, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they need to come up with sensible
regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even the FDA threw up their hands and
said, yeah, this doesn't really fit into
[SPEAKER_06]: our monomolecular medicine model,
which you take an active ingredient
[SPEAKER_06]: through clinical trials to show that
statistically, the outcome for that
[SPEAKER_06]: patient works better when they take that
medicine at this particular dose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, cannabis doesn't work like that,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if Mashewn teaches us anything,
teaches us it's not just about a single
[SPEAKER_06]: ingredient, it's about all the ingredients
that are in there and everything that we
[SPEAKER_06]: like about the varieties that you guys
breed and the hash that you guys make.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just, it's an incredible
thing, but it can't be regulated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the hemp industry and the
cannabis industry are fighting at one
[SPEAKER_06]: another.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in some estimates, they decide that
hemp industry is being greater than $60
[SPEAKER_06]: billion.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's greater than all of the
collective cannabis industries in all the
[SPEAKER_06]: different states.
[SPEAKER_06]: You add all that together, the hemp
industry is bigger than that because
[SPEAKER_06]: larger dressable market, everything's
about cost, everything's about making the
[SPEAKER_06]: cheapest thing that suffices out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, how do you, how do you tie that
together?
[SPEAKER_06]: Somehow you got to figure out a way to tie
that together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big beverages now in here because of
what's happening in places like in
[SPEAKER_06]: Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you have, you know, these canning
wines that could make literally thousands
[SPEAKER_06]: of cans an hour of this hemp derived D9 10
milligram beverage.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell you, when it's nano emulsified
Mark, even seasoned THC users like us,
[SPEAKER_06]: I can taste it about halfway through the
can.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have them like, whoa, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That nano emulsification really does
something to the biological activity and
[SPEAKER_06]: the onset of activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll stop there, but I just think that,
yeah, Mojave, I don't know what you're
[SPEAKER_06]: seeing in California, but everywhere else
in the United States, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry and the profitability are in the
toilet because they have to compete with
[SPEAKER_06]: this unwieldy hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I think they're losing the battle.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the hemp farmers too, if they only
really understood that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's huge money in the grain of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like here in Canada, our hemp industry is
not CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not a big part of what we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: We grow grain, we grow the seed and then
the seed gets either crushed into oil or
[SPEAKER_07]: it gets de-hulled and sold as hemp hearts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is a massive business.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is not a drug variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not growing a canopy.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just completely different.
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually follows the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, Mojave, don't you think that
the people in Washington were snookered on
[SPEAKER_06]: exactly what Mark is saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they viewed hemp as being
this industrial grain that makes seed oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, there's new studies that show
what we predicted back on Hash Church many
[SPEAKER_06]: years ago, that if you feed hemp seeds to
chicken, those chickens are healthier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now Tyson has got that data and it's
just, yeah, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: We predicted it on Hash Church with its
clappings.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I think our government was
thinking seeds, oil, rope.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did not contemplate CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if Robert here, he would say,
because we've written about this quite a
[SPEAKER_05]: bit, it's just simply what is hemp?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's the big discussion in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've consulted in Minnesota for the
past almost four years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's pretty weird, the transition
that's happened there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of like become this petri
dish for what is cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the big C genus cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it started as a no-flower medical
only state where it was just vapes and
[SPEAKER_05]: gummies in the Delta-9 world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then quickly CBD became a thing and
people wanted to grow it, but they didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: know, literally farmers were growing
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: The farmers themselves didn't know what
the downstream product they were making
[SPEAKER_05]: was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone just literally showed up and said,
hey, plant these seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be good for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they kind of had an idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it CBD?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it fiber?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it grain?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was literally that confusing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell you stories about literal
harvests where people backed semis filled
[SPEAKER_05]: with plants into big manufacturing floors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they didn't even know what was the
product that was gonna be made because
[SPEAKER_05]: they jumped so fast as farmers,
like, hey, we grow plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said, this is a big economic boom
in this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, over the years, it's transitioned
to the most, almost the most liberal model
[SPEAKER_05]: for cannabis on earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I drive from Minnesota,
a gas station to gas station, every single
[SPEAKER_05]: gas station is selling cannabis beverages
and vape gummies.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get cannabis beverages on tap at a
bar in Minnesota, which I don't even
[SPEAKER_05]: understand how that works because they do
have regulations on per serving amounts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on tap, it's pretty vague what 16
ounces is or 12.
[SPEAKER_05]: And anyway, and they have adult use.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can grow up to eight plants at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been incredibly forward thinking
in their social equity program with the
[SPEAKER_05]: tribal relationship in terms of giving
tribes a headstart into the rec market.
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, the whole thing is still
wacky because it's an island in the middle
[SPEAKER_05]: of this big crazy continent of cannabis
laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they also have an interstate commerce
bands on what can and can't come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the far out thing is just like other
states, it's not based off of federal DEA
[SPEAKER_05]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's their own, like in California,
you can't order a BB gun on Amazon,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll ship it to you in other states,
but you can't order one because that's
[SPEAKER_05]: just a California law.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't take BB guns online.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Minnesota it's like, well, we also
don't take THCA online.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's not whether a THCA is
legal in the state or whether it's legal
[SPEAKER_05]: wherever, but we just have a ban on
imports because they know how threatening
[SPEAKER_05]: it is to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're going to go to other
emerging market that California,
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado, and Oklahoma, who are now not
even, you know, now, and that's,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is the big question, Mark,
is that it's CBD is so cheap because
[SPEAKER_05]: people grew so much that they couldn't
sell or process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they now going to be growing THCA
instead of high CBD varieties in order to
[SPEAKER_05]: just circumvent the processing completely?
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that going to be the new farm-built
crop in these states that are still?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the problem with, well, there's lots
of problems there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I come from the regulated
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I know about the hemp world,
but I'm more along the lines of like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, getting licensed operations
growing, you know, and we have to do
[SPEAKER_06]: background checks on all of our employees.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to have security cameras 24 seven,
you know, the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is like the cannabis industry
treated like nuclear waste kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Believe me, I'm not about the over-owners
regulations that apply, that they apply to
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you look at it again, I don't think
the intention of when Congress passed the
[SPEAKER_06]: farm bill was to unleash active
pharmaceutical ingredients on the farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think that that was the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think, again, they pot,
I think they were snookered on seeds and
[SPEAKER_06]: rope and oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they ever thought about,
you know, the CBD versus THC and
[SPEAKER_06]: converting CBD into THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, that chemistry is as old as Roger
Adams.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the worst thing is that there's
products like THC and CP, which don't come
[SPEAKER_06]: from hemp and don't come from CBD that are
just completely synthetic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they're completely synthetic,
well now where can you get completely
[SPEAKER_06]: synthetic active ingredients?
[SPEAKER_06]: Pharmaceuticals made places like China and
India.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now it's just, you know, again,
these are, these aren't being extracted
[SPEAKER_06]: from plants that are grown in the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're chemicals that are made in the
laboratory that are exploiting the
[SPEAKER_06]: wonderful activity and safety really of
phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've heard from a few people that have
tried this THCP thing and it is serious
[SPEAKER_06]: business.
[SPEAKER_06]: It like puts you down in your chair and
like for two days, you don't want to smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: anything or be around anything like weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, that's not a very
pleasurable experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you turn up the volume of compounds
that can agonize your CB1 receptors?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way medicinal chemistry works.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's something that's great about
the cannabis plant is it's got more than
[SPEAKER_06]: just THC, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll know that your experience with
cannabis doesn't necessarily have to do
[SPEAKER_06]: with the THC level.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why the THC level is so
important in commerce is because of
[SPEAKER_06]: prohibition and because of like when
dispensaries and distributors are doing
[SPEAKER_06]: bulk buying and they're like, gee,
am I going to buy the 25% or am I going to
[SPEAKER_06]: buy the stuff that analyzes for 15%?
[SPEAKER_06]: Chances are the stuff that's analyzing for
25% is really 15%.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just cherry picking their data
that they're getting their COAs made on.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of this is just an artifact of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think like the last thing just about
the hemp thing is that, yeah, probably
[SPEAKER_06]: people who are going to listen to what I
say and say, oh man, you're against the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant, you're against taking it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, no, I'm all about the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if people want cannabis and they want
THCA, they need to end prohibition because
[SPEAKER_06]: only when prohibition is, so I've said
this many times before, as long as there's
[SPEAKER_06]: prohibition everywhere, anywhere,
there'll be a black market everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like in California, for example,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter what the laws are in
California, the laws are fucked up in
[SPEAKER_06]: other places.
[SPEAKER_06]: So California becomes basically the supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the worst thing that's
happening now, again, is that there's this
[SPEAKER_06]: war between businesses that are trying to
get products out through the hemp channels
[SPEAKER_06]: versus cannabis channels are in law suits
together right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because again, the folks in Southern
California, because they've had to pay
[SPEAKER_06]: large dollars to get their places licensed
and to get their places up and running.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now there's an unfair competition from
this competitive landscape that's outside
[SPEAKER_06]: their jurisdiction, that's bringing cheap
products into their state.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the perfect storm.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be interesting to see how this
changes, if it changes at all in the next
[SPEAKER_06]: version of the farm bill, which as you
know, Mojave, they just kicked the can
[SPEAKER_06]: down the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's an election year, who knows?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe things will happen and they'll end
up deregulating the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think moving the schedule three is an
absolute non-starter because if you read
[SPEAKER_06]: the regulations, none of the cannabis
supply chain that exists today would be
[SPEAKER_06]: compliant with schedule three listing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this is basically an invitation
for a big farmer to come in and start
[SPEAKER_06]: acquiring MSOs that are positioned to get
their GMP certifications.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know I'm doing a lot of talking here,
but yeah, things are fucked up down in the
[SPEAKER_06]: states, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: But hopefully everything will move forward
because of people's love for the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like to almost put it back to like
micro-brew.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, once you let the micro-brew kind
of bug out, there were no going back for
[SPEAKER_06]: some of us who will never drink Budweiser
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll only drink a locally brewed
micro-brew, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think maybe with cannabis,
again, artisan quality will really come
[SPEAKER_06]: through on that and that'll end up winning
anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much about Walmart hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's no shortage of it for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always a balance, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the whole time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you most people are happy with the
vape pen, gas station, THC, P diluted with
[SPEAKER_07]: CVS or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are the anomalies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our group is a special group that's like,
you know, part of a smaller group that
[SPEAKER_07]: will grow just like I'm sure IPA beer has
grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the percentage of IPA
beer is versus like Coors and old
[SPEAKER_07]: Milwaukee and Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean like locally brewed micro-brew?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, compared to big beer, you know,
what does big beer own of the beer
[SPEAKER_07]: industry?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it like 50% or is it like 80 or 90%?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Mojave, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, my costs go down here and I
could certainly buy huge pallets of Bud
[SPEAKER_06]: Light, but right next to the Bud Light,
there's locally brewed Vermont beer.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so much better, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But people aren't buying it by the pallet,
probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll put it this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny because me and Rob write a lot
about the comparison between hops and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis and also the craft beer and craft
cannabis kind of issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as craft beer grew, what happened,
Marcus, was the big alcohol bought all the
[SPEAKER_05]: craft companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are now, that's why micro-brew
became a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, now it's actually nano-brew
because even the micro-brews are often
[SPEAKER_05]: owned by Anheuser-Busch.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to that point, it got the,
and I say this, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, if it made their beer better and it
expanded and said, hey, we're
[SPEAKER_05]: Anheuser-Busch and we think we can sell
that to our customers, as well,
[SPEAKER_05]: then to me, that's a better world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think our quality of cannabis,
the issue, the big issue to me is that
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis is really complex, but growing it
is just agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as soon as we figure out the growing
part, it's actually not a lot harder to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow amazing cannabis that tastes amazing
and has a great effect versus complete
[SPEAKER_05]: shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once they figure it out, it's like,
you can get, I mean, I can go and buy
[SPEAKER_05]: blueberries from Chile or I can buy an
apple from New Zealand and it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like the whole supply chain,
we can grow amazing weed for people and
[SPEAKER_05]: they can be big giant corporations that
will be involved and there'll be small
[SPEAKER_05]: companies that'll be involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: But ultimately right now it's just a mess
because there's so much data and so much
[SPEAKER_05]: transition going on that people,
you know, it just opens up a can of worms.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think like when, like,
and that's one of the biggest issues for
[SPEAKER_05]: me is like, you can't hold the plant to a
higher standard than other plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't blame agriculture for wanting
to be involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't blame business as usual for
being involved because that's just the way
[SPEAKER_05]: it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've always tried to normalize the plant,
but like we're supposed to be like the
[SPEAKER_05]: shepherds that make it through that
transition to hand the plant over to those
[SPEAKER_05]: people who are going to take it anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, so we have a little bit of like
protector kind of entitlement over like
[SPEAKER_05]: shaping the future industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cool thing is I think we can I
think like working with the right people,
[SPEAKER_05]: becoming successful with your brands and
your genetics and all that shit really
[SPEAKER_05]: shapes the future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, you know, I just,
I don't, I don't think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's all doom and gloom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that it's going to be a
completely different thing on the other
[SPEAKER_05]: side, you know, and that's cool because
that's what we all kind of wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's just, it's difficult to
hold the hand through the transition and
[SPEAKER_05]: take the blame.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you look at, if you look at
like what's happened in retail in general,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we've reduced it down to Costco,
Walmart, and Jeff Bezos, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the whole distribution business
model, I mean, those big corporations you
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about Mojave, those are the ones that
are basically predicated on roads and
[SPEAKER_06]: cheap gasoline for their trucks to
basically go from their fulfillment
[SPEAKER_06]: centers out to those stores and put all
those goods.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like when you're in Walmart,
and when you're making Walmart purchase,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, it would be great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, again, I don't know when Walmart and
cannabis are gonna team up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when they do, you know, it's gonna be
like, yeah, it's just gonna be part of
[SPEAKER_06]: your shopping, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, I can get a pair of blue jeans,
I can get motor oil, I can get,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, a pack of chicken breasts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And oh, yeah, I can pick up some weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: All underneath one roof, because they own
that distribution channel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's super powerful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because like, when you're looking at like
dispensaries, like, I was giving some
[SPEAKER_06]: advice to a client of mine around,
you know, they're like, okay, we gotta,
[SPEAKER_06]: we gotta think about where we want to put
our dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, you know what, next to the BMW
dealer, you know, you, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's like, like, today in retail,
I mean, you have to think about so many
[SPEAKER_06]: different patterns about like,
how humans purchase things and where
[SPEAKER_06]: humans go to get things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my god, when you're sitting at the,
I don't know, McDonald's drive thru,
[SPEAKER_06]: let's hope you're not if you're watching
the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're looking at I don't know,
some sign of like, hey, you know what,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna go pop over to that store.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I just was looking at that sign
while I'm sitting here, waiting for my
[SPEAKER_06]: kids and their Big Mac.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like, today, retail is a
completely different game is completely
[SPEAKER_06]: different, just even in the last four or
five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know, I mean, like,
if you're going to introduce like retail
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, I mean, my god, actually,
the companies that have put a lot of money
[SPEAKER_06]: into their dispensaries, you have to,
you know, really, did, again, draw people
[SPEAKER_06]: in, you have to have aquariums,
you have to have like nice coaches and
[SPEAKER_06]: everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the differentiator at cannabis
retail, and ultimately, like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: what are you up against?
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone who's putting an $8 vape pen on
their credit card, you know, that they're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to get shipped to them a day later,
with their Jeff Bezos package from Amazon,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, it's a different retail
marketplace, it really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and you're not even getting into
predictive algorithms that actually
[SPEAKER_07]: manipulate and predict the buying patterns
of the humans, because it's not just about
[SPEAKER_07]: fitting in and finding your place.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a rabbit hole that unless you're a
complete and total sociopath, you probably
[SPEAKER_07]: don't really want to go down that rabbit
hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Marcus, I don't mean to make cracks
at like, some celebrity branded cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I've always thought that, you know,
if you need celebrity branding to sell
[SPEAKER_06]: your cannabis, find better cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I should feel like that too,
in a way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just like this whole branding
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you might buy that Bob Marley jar
once, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, oh, you got that nice jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you do with it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Put it on the shelf with all your other
jars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, I'm more interested in the branded
ones that like the name means something
[SPEAKER_07]: with like a hash maker, or a grower or
both who's doing you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: And at that point, it's like, I think of
my brand more along in the lines of that,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, people are like, okay, this guy,
like, sort of helped pioneer the water
[SPEAKER_07]: extraction thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been like focused on producing
quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hash before hip hop, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, geez, I think we've done two
hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty good for me today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I really appreciated the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very natural, like it was a year
plus ago, just getting into it and having
[SPEAKER_07]: good discussions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I learned things today that I didn't
know that were going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm definitely going to look deeper into
that LA Times story, Mojave, about the
[SPEAKER_07]: vape pens and the hardware and the shit
that they're putting in those.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not a good scene at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian, always a pleasure, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you come back with more flavors.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have another Hash Church here next
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mojave, thank you so much for your
perspective and your knowledge and your
[SPEAKER_07]: stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love the stories when you and Brian were
going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that old history, you know,
because it really is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: we need to get Chris Bennett back on the
cannabis historian because Chris has
[SPEAKER_07]: always gone further back into the history.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think his ability to keep history,
to receive these stories and to put them
[SPEAKER_07]: to pen would be a very valuable addition
to our community.
[SPEAKER_07]: Papa Sift, Ryan, thanks for showing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Homie, thanks for making the good hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe next time we'll talk about the
differences between the Osprey and the
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag because you're one of the few
people that have both of them in your lab
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're operating simultaneously with
both of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll get you talking about that next
time, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Marc Saldon, thank you, dude,
from Vermont on the good side of town.
[SPEAKER_07]: You and Brian must not be too,
too far away from one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like four hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's worth like a dab session.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys should link up one of these days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, Wade, thank you so much for
coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for sharing your story and your
vibe and your positivity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope to see you guys again next
week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do it again, invite a couple
of new people.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have anyone that you're thinking of
that you want to get invited on for next
[SPEAKER_07]: week, just send me an email.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the meantime, thank you guys,
everyone on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just went under 200 people,
but we had over 200 people watching for
[SPEAKER_07]: the full two hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big thanks to Bingo Lombardi for holding
down the chat and all the good folks that
[SPEAKER_07]: are in there chatting away and keeping it
going and agreeing and disagreeing with us
[SPEAKER_07]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a big thank you to Thomas from
Grandmaster LED for hooking me up with the
[SPEAKER_07]: knowledge on how I can change the view for
coming in and sharing your great new
[SPEAKER_07]: addition to the panel here on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will say, may the full melt bless
you sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're all welcome to say goodbye and then
we'll end it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to talk with you, Mojave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to hear from everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
