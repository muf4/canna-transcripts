[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, welcome to Bubble Man's
world!
[SPEAKER_01]: I just bumped into this crazy bastard
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I better take that down, I look like I'm
glowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does he put into my hands,
right when he arrives, this is what he
[SPEAKER_01]: puts into my hands, a Marcel, like,
ready, air-trapped, sick Sherlock,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then with the D-Rex marble on the
other side, which I personally am friends
[SPEAKER_01]: with both these dudes, have been friends
with them for a long time, not as
[SPEAKER_01]: connected with D-Rex as I used to be,
but still, when I saw it, it put a smile
[SPEAKER_01]: on my face, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first time I saw one of these
marbles was a long time ago, and on such a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what do you got going on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Full melt the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, excellent, full melt the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the full melt the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Padded out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Padded out, finally, finally, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go, kind of grabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we got to light?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this torch as well, in case we
wanted to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we just bumped into each other because
we are taking our sons to a movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: My son's first movie, so this is a pretty
epic moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be funny, it's The Penguins of
Madagascar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he loves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually with me, with my son, I usually go
see sort of more of an older person kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of movie, but today this was the choice,
and I thought, you know, I should let
[SPEAKER_01]: these guys know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it was really nice to invite us,
because Owen is beyond excited to A,
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out with Tosh and you, and B,
see The Penguins of Madagascar,
[SPEAKER_00]: which he loves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's a family affair here on Bubble
Man's World today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a ripping, awesome rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I just took on Bubble Man's World
here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing actually raged.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit it like a dab though, I didn't like
smoke it like a Sherlock, I literally just
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked it through in one hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got the first shipment from the
stuff from the Pipe Masters collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it's... Let's see if you guys can
catch that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I got this, and I got the Gordman J.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maplesden Sherlock rig, and this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found my dabber eye as I was searching
for the tools of the trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure what you had exactly,
but I brought some gifted hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is I believe chemo bubble from our
good friend Hirant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some, it's sitting in
sweet skunk dry sift, and then I also have
[SPEAKER_01]: some D420K, that uber-goober like
ridiculous dry sift that's a year old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And has just greased the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll hit ya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, we thought before we went and
saw this movie, we would share a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bong rip with you guys, a little Sherlock
rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give props to Marcel, give props to
D-Rack, give props to all the growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the hash smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: From the industry, let's go watch a movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go watch a movie!
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys in a bit.
Thanks for watching.
