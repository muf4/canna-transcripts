[SPEAKER_10]: Hey everyone, welcome to Bubbleman's
World.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kind of gearing up for Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today's the day John Berfello did his
interview with, I guess, the National,
[SPEAKER_10]: CBC National.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be on March 31st and April
1st.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can check that out all across Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: And today we're leaving for Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are off to Spain.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're flying out of here in a couple of
hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought I would start the video of
the journey to Spain with a beeline rip.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know that D-nail is packed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, maybe you should put some hash in the
bowl there, Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to hit a little watermelon that
we made up with Ron up in Proctor there
[SPEAKER_10]: some months back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really nice punch to this hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great spicy flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Extremely dried.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bowl didn't want to come out there,
which does happen sometimes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not so much when you're hitting the
D-nail, because you don't really need to
[SPEAKER_10]: pull the bowl out.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess that's locked in there a
little bit from the last time I had the
[SPEAKER_10]: D-nail in this bowl.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to deal with that later.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, super excited to get to Spain,
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're flying to Amsterdam today as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'll be nice just to kick down in
Amsterdam for a few hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, we're going to bring you along
for a little bit of the journey.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up, I'll be at the airport bumping
into John.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go finish packing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And enjoy the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope to see some of you in Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we have arrived at Vancouver
International Airport.
[SPEAKER_10]: And who's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: John B.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to Spain?
[SPEAKER_09]: Spain, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I just.
[SPEAKER_10]: My ride just pulled out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at how long that is.
[SPEAKER_10]: My ride just pulled out.
[SPEAKER_10]: They just dropped me off.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess we're going to go drop our bags
off and maybe go and have some trip a
[SPEAKER_10]: stick session.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's remember something, John.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to get in there, get our bags
put away so we can go enjoy some Puff
[SPEAKER_10]: Wednesday here at the Vancouver
International Airport.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.
Hey,
guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: John and I here at the Vancouver
International Airport departures.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just had a little bit of lunch,
a little peanut butter sandwich and an
[SPEAKER_10]: orange and kind of feeling that it's that
time to show me where you're trippy.
[SPEAKER_06]: John forgot his trippy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's rephrase that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be sharing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be sharing in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I also have a chamber and an
extra glass chamber from Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my battery is still charging.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a high five.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's more like a fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a sweet cut.
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll be able to sit down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I've been to Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful city, beautiful people,
really great event.
[SPEAKER_10]: The spandamus is amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very busy, kind of cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be, you know,
the Spanish have a lot of leeway with the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're able to do a lot of things pretty
much since 2002 or 2003 when Switzerland
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of closed it down.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people moved to Maghreb.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be nice to be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be nice to check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: A little trippy rip.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are at the International Airport so
there's a lot of buses and traffic going
[SPEAKER_10]: by.
[SPEAKER_10]: Constant.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got ourselves a nice little spot
here in the sun though.
[SPEAKER_10]: Literally our bags are checked.
[SPEAKER_10]: All we've got is the carry-on bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: By carry-on bags, I do mean we have the
D-nail with multiple whips, mothership,
[SPEAKER_10]: quartz bowls, tie bowls, ceramic inserts,
the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you hold the thing on, yeah,
it's not really hitting.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we need to push that down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll give you a really good grip.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you making?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we're going to be eating some
caramels, some high CVD canatonic caramels
[SPEAKER_10]: from the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a couple each to wolf down on
the plane.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I guess Puff Wednesday today is
going to be in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be in Amsterdam and it's
going to be in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, it's going to leak into
Thursday because of the nine hour time
[SPEAKER_10]: change and the nine plus hour flight.
[SPEAKER_10]: But for us, Puff Wednesday is going to be
an international Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we'll be chatting it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so nice to feel that it's just legal
for us to enjoy our medicine, our
[SPEAKER_10]: caramels, which I think I'm going to eat
one.
[SPEAKER_10]: So these, once again, are from the Great
Gardener.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice high CVD, canatonic, not overpowering
by any means, very tasty.
[SPEAKER_10]: They just give us a nice, relaxed vibe on
our flight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much at this very spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is our spot if you're ever in
Vancouver and you're at the International
[SPEAKER_10]: Airport, come by and hit my and John's
bench.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look around, you might find a
treat.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always best to leave something
behind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fly safe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, we're going to continue to puff
and we will see you, I guess, maybe on the
[SPEAKER_10]: plane, more likely we'll see you in
Amsterdam at Schiphol.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sound good, John?
[SPEAKER_10]: We never stopped puffing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, why would you?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're still here puffing at the spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: The trippy stick's hitting like a
champion.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, just push that resin down and
she gives good rips.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so a couple of CVD canatonic
caramels down the throat.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so beautiful in the day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: What a great time to be in the beautiful
sky and that view as we're leaving
[SPEAKER_11]: Vancouver and just flying over your house
in the direction we go and fly right over
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike's place.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much an exciting day.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll see some buddies in Amsterdam and
then split out of there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably we'll be on the plane with some
friends, so we'll take wages as to who
[SPEAKER_10]: we're going to be on the plane with.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it going to be Soma?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it going to be Ed?
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's going to be on our plane?
[SPEAKER_10]: See you later.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so John and I have arrived at
the, I guess it's kind of the food court.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's like schwaggy food in the
background, actually milestones over
[SPEAKER_10]: there, which is probably where we're going
to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where we are.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the cool part here is check out this
aquarium in the Vancouver airport.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, you know, some 10,000 gallon salt
water.
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's like, that's all alive.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the whole place is amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're pretty cool too, the way the fish
are like swimming around backwards.
[SPEAKER_10]: Starfish stuck to the bank there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see them all down there,
all the starfishes and the ling cod down
[SPEAKER_11]: there looking like they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's one in there under the rock.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like a sucker of some sort.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, let's go hang out and get some
food.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey JB.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, looks like we found a nice little
rooftop terrace here in Schiphol airport.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, should we set up the camera and do a
couple of reps?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, welcome to Schiphol international
airport in Amsterdam, everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're sitting here, me and John,
just enjoying the beautiful Amsterdam day.
[SPEAKER_10]: We flew here in under nine hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_10]: The caramels lasted nice on the plane,
the trippy stick session before we just
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of had a little trippy stick session.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't really want to attract any
attention, so we're having a mini trippy
[SPEAKER_10]: stick session off cam.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're sitting here well-baked and we're
going to head down to Barcelona in about
[SPEAKER_10]: two hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we will be in Barcelona, coming out of
the airport and we will definitely be
[SPEAKER_03]: setting up the camera and having a fun
Wednesday, trippy stick session in
[SPEAKER_03]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barcelona, as they like to say here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned, pull up a chair,
pull up a bong and we'll see you in
[SPEAKER_03]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got Simon, we got Jason, we got Don,
Ed Rosenthal somewhere over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Johnny's in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if he's going to put on his
purple wizard outfit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, the purple wizard outfit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to put any outfits on?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabs, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll be dabbing with you guys soon in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: See ya.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Welcome to
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please remain seated until the faster
seatbelt sign has been switched off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the end of our flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to say goodbye to you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to die alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank you for flying KLM and we hope to
see you soon on board one of our KLM
[SPEAKER_00]: flights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy your stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and goodbye.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, freshly landed in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_10]: About to jump in a cab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just head over to DNA's hotel and maybe
get a D-Nail session happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got dabs, they got tangy,
we got watermelon.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I think your bag just fell.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that puffing?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to pull my trippy stick out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're here at Don's room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Aaron's coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: John is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The D-Nail is in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by D-Nail, you're not talking about
Don.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about the actual D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual Nail of D.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you don't smoke flowers,
but I know you appreciate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
Can't get the resin without them.
There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just can't get the resin without them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the legal Dutch... Look at the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don Morris, 12-6-2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still carry the same containers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't paying that 12 euros a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the idea of what people in
Canada are going to do too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just not going to be paying that
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's a new one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's called 24 karat gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kosher tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like kosher, but then... That's
nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking crazy, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fire, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, 24 karat gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kosher is Jew gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kosher is Jew gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The crew that grew it called it Jew gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what they called it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you could see it a little better
because it looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't want to call it Jew gold because
it's not really a name you can market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kosher kush, but all we did was
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Jew gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the Jew gold,
the pink kushes, all that, and I got all
[SPEAKER_04]: different beans for all this kind of crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: The kosher times the tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since kosher is really Jew gold,
we call it 24 karat gold.
[SPEAKER_06]: You heard it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we do make regular seeds,
we'll use the tangy, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also flame, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be the dankest weed we see while
we're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a Skywalker cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an OG cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't really have a lineage.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have different versions of their
Skywalker or whatever, but that would be
[SPEAKER_04]: the runnage for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aaron has some tangy on him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought some tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That smells killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get this detail on and it's
going to be like ... I'm glad that one
[SPEAKER_10]: plug worked because the other one didn't.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so glad.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always a little bit nerd racking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so rank.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, let's say, I'll smoke a joint of
it because it's nice and I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't really get me so fucked up,
so then I'm always feeling that I just
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked and I still need to smoke.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I got the camera on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just chilling.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hang it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have gifts from afar, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gifts from afar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice when you show up to the
hotel and the woman hands you a box and
[SPEAKER_04]: says, by the way, this is a package that
was delivered for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you said, this is called bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called on the phone, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is called bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, open it up, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what we have.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, gifts are so great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for putting that water in,
John.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: That definitely gets you the first rep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably the color on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does get water hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weed will be one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's grown good and it's organic,
but it's aged and it's Spanish style.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be killer, but it's not
going to compare to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: 73 to 160 mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't do any VHF.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks like oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuck to your nose, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's definitely a nice black
little shiny turd.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can see it right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: John, you're up, buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all using it medicinally,
but let's just say you're using it a
[SPEAKER_10]: little more medicinally.
[SPEAKER_10]: You heard what happened to John?
[SPEAKER_10]: He fell 30 feet, broke his neck in two
spots in his back, shattered his leg.
[SPEAKER_10]: His hand smoked the wall on the way down
and it got all cracked his jaw and broke
[SPEAKER_10]: his back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where did you fall, bro?
[SPEAKER_10]: He has a lot of pharmaceutical drugs
living underwater.
[SPEAKER_12]: He has a lot of pharmaceutical drugs
living underwater.
[SPEAKER_12]: He has a lot of pharmaceutical drugs
living underwater.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where did you fall, bro?
[SPEAKER_12]: He uses cannabis as his pain map.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't use anything else at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing interviews with CBC National,
I see TV news and I'm published all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, where did you fall from,
bro?
[SPEAKER_12]: I still don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had Genie 2000, I live and talk to it by
trade, I'm a blazer by trade.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which one did you hit?
Watermelon.
[SPEAKER_12]: You hit the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to try this one.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's what it is, you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pull myself out of a wheelchair room.
[SPEAKER_12]: You fucked yourself up, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, he fucked himself up so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show you guys the quality that
we're dealing with here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what Don just opened up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the quality or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a gift from the south of Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Further south than we are now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful gift.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the other one too, that was the 73
through 160.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see it's just shiny as fuck.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got a couple of strains as well,
Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_10]: What, PK, purple kush?
[SPEAKER_04]: PK, yep, and candy kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or kosher, but when I smell it,
it's hard to see because it's hard to tell
[SPEAKER_04]: because I think it's been aged hugely.
[SPEAKER_10]: They look like they were aged,
all those buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this might have been last year's
apple.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my first Spanish bubble since I've
been here and it looks absolutely
[SPEAKER_10]: full-mouthed and delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just showed it to you on the camera,
so let's give it a rip.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm looking at it to see how well,
I mean the stuff is just like,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's turned completely to oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: Completely to oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like, that's a 90 or a 73?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 73 through 160.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up, Cardinal, how are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got your package.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to tell you thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with Bubble Man and Aaron and we
just sampled your goods and that's the
[SPEAKER_04]: first Spanish love we've encountered this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I'll put you on speakerphone.
[SPEAKER_04]: There.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful hash, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just smoked it out of the D-nail with
the mothership.
[SPEAKER_10]: It melted into a liquid, dissipated with
little to any residue and a beautiful high
[SPEAKER_10]: after a 10-hour, 14-hour flight,
let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we appreciate it as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, man, absolutely, that would be
really cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: John and I are here in this elevator with
a ton of crap that we barely fit and we're
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna go see Tony and Jibs, so let's make
our way.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right,
[SPEAKER_10]: so we just got to Tony's apartment linked
up with Giddy up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jibs, John's still in the house and
we're just about to rip up some bubble
[SPEAKER_10]: hash in the D-nail, so I guess we're gonna
rearrange the apartment first because it's
[SPEAKER_10]: just not quite the way we want it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love how Giddy's exhausted so you have a
moving furniture.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll be back soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Jibs is loading up a hit.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we got there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Some Mendo, Frost with some Beelzebub.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_08]: I see, you're disking it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony, you ready?
[SPEAKER_08]: You better get ready, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you too, man, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at me, I'm just like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they bringing over all the camera
equipment?
[SPEAKER_08]: Put it on, that'll inspire the watch.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on, Tony.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony, it's on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's on.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice and slow and steady.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this ceramic?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's nice and slow and steady.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's frothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just goes to nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was so good for the camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he didn't even do that on purpose.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just a loving guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mila's on the computer chatting in the
background.
[SPEAKER_10]: The mothership.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Viva la Espanola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transdermal THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pure CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is it CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure CBN.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if anyone has seizures, and there's
five types, but if you feel that you want
[SPEAKER_07]: to test that out, instead of chasing the
strain, chasing the rainbow if you will,
[SPEAKER_07]: and access, these are available on both
sides now.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where people really had a
