[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just saying hello to my beautiful little
ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are producing some real nice,
heady, heady resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just so excited about having a little
prop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, as some of you know who
have been following my social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so fucking stoked that Matt,
the great gardener, passed along the sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't think you realize how happy
I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate the bubble barb,
and I appreciate the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are huge gifts as well, and I'm
going to go on about those, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the sweet skunk I have a history with,
and I just wanted to say thank you,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great gardener, house of the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are good folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick up their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their high CBD marker seeds are going to
be coming out soon with Warlock and Renee,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they've got Haoma, Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are literally going through the whole
gamut of their strains and adding the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: marker from the Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check them out if you need some high
CBD strains, or if you just really want
[SPEAKER_00]: full melt certified genetics that I can
assure that you will love the taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor, and the potency of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to say goodbye to these little
ladies because I'm heading up to Whistler
[SPEAKER_00]: for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go see Phil from True
Genetics and a couple other good folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully we'll do some wet washing
while we're up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a little video to show you
my little measly crop that I got going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just six plants and a little tiny two foot
by four foot tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't be happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thanks for watching Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a ton of good videos coming up for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puff Wednesday with John a couple of days
ago where we did some really fun things
[SPEAKER_00]: and that video is really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then literally the next day I went
over to the great gardeners and we filmed
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some good videos coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
