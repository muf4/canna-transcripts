[SPEAKER_06]: Jamaica has decriminalized marijuana,
a bill passed by legislators on Tuesday
[SPEAKER_03]: night.
[SPEAKER_03]: A major step was taken on Tuesday in
modernizing Jamaica's ganja law.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have states legalizing marijuana
for recreational use here, it sends a
[SPEAKER_01]: message to other countries that,
hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't something worth wasting
resources on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should stop criminalizing and
incarcerating people for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: People say it's going to be better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was a lot worse before because
every week there are a bunch of cops
[SPEAKER_03]: coming up here and burning up the plants
and doing all kinds of crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only thing I love, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only thing I know how to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a mason, I'm not a carpenter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a plumber.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, when you find
something you're good at and something
[SPEAKER_03]: people respect you for, you just keep
doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm up in the mountains in the
government land, so when I get myself
[SPEAKER_03]: legalized, I go down to my family property
and farm, like, a bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is
[SPEAKER_02]: the colonial path that made ganja illegal
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica didn't have a ganja problem,
but because Britain, Britain had a ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: problem, a opium problem first in China,
a ganja problem in India, and that was how
[SPEAKER_02]: Britain decided to impose the illegal
aspect of ganja in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1912, prior to that, we had no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many brothers were brutalized,
killed, imprisoned for ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today, when we have these festivals,
we must honor the ancestors that went
[SPEAKER_02]: through so much to make us able now to be
able to use ganja freely.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at the Stepping High Ganja Festival,
the 13th annual Stepping High Ganja
[SPEAKER_07]: Festival.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first year out of 13 years
that they've had an exemption from the
[SPEAKER_07]: government.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the police that are present aren't
arresting people, obviously.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're allowed to have ganja.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're allowed to have ganja sales on the
property.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a really wonderful, beautiful
ganja event here that's been going,
[SPEAKER_07]: what's up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Ganja plants right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, aye.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_07]: With the police right behind him,
you gotta love that, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's walking right by the police.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got the ganja plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a photo right there, like bang,
bang, shebang.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cop's like, I don't even know what to
say about that, but that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the vibe that's changing here
in Jamaica with the decriminalization,
[SPEAKER_07]: with the allowance of 56 grams or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ganja, ganja should be free, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Free like the bird in the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ganja mean everything to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't care about the police.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell the purpose, the white widow,
the AK-47, the blue fairy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all those stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not having a biased opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, you follow the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here, we're just doing what we have
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can smooth the ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coconut water and ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like sperms and egg together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the coconut water is the sperms and the
ganja is the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's raw and it is medical and it's really
helping the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Strengthen the immune system against Zika
or any little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: And learn also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's up to them, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because somebody would look to you to
learn when they could still learn from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they could learn from both.
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way, dude, enjoy your day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Profit margin was based on the prohibition
of the plant, which is actually based on
[SPEAKER_07]: people going to prison for the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely black youth have been locked up
for cannabis at an accelerated number
[SPEAKER_05]: compared to white youth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've dedicated the last 25 years of my
life to cannabis and I have been arrested
[SPEAKER_05]: for it and I have had my problems for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The vibe has really picked up in a unique
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Live from Negril, Jamaica and surrounded
by beautiful bugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Real shout out goes to this gentleman
right here for winning the People's Choice
[SPEAKER_08]: Awards with pretty much the nicest herb in
this country that I have been able to find
[SPEAKER_08]: so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why they don't fully legalise
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, if they do, that's a poor man
that will get rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: See it?
Thank you.
