[SPEAKER_03]: This is the awkward part of my knee.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did that wrong with the elbow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a funny bone but it's in my
knee.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a funny time here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff Wednesday with Johnny B in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm always well, you know what.
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to meet my little boy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got to come over.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been busy myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you, of course, being a new dad.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like I'm in the dark here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm in the dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to move forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, being a new dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you saying there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just saying it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It looked good on you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, I decided to make hash and
I wanted to come over and bring you,
[SPEAKER_12]: of course, what I love so much is the Medi
Kush.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, I'm so stoked on your Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_12]: Grabbing the 73 right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right to the 73.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right to the 73.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, I just made it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's also some of my little pony
right here, too.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, nice little ponies.
[SPEAKER_15]: Little ponies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, today, John and I are going to make
some hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge surprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to surprise you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to make some hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to dry sift and we're going to
wet wash.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not going to waste our ice like we
did last time, actually, because last time
[SPEAKER_12]: we did a video, we had ice.
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually did an ALS bucket challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We dumped it on our heads.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this time, we're actually going to,
well, just to reassure, I decided to bring
[SPEAKER_12]: a bag of wheat, actually, and I'm going to
do some crushing of some nice watermelon
[SPEAKER_12]: that has now been getting really closely
and dry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is crispy and, of course,
I'm dumping it on that screen over there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll probably show you doing that as,
of course, I got really not too much dry
[SPEAKER_12]: sift.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's the way on my screens,
but this is something I wanted to share
[SPEAKER_12]: with you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: We wanted to do a quick little,
we'll show you a little trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've showed it already a few times and
it's a quick and easy way to access near
[SPEAKER_03]: pure gland head dry sift in smaller
amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: John was going to do it here last time he
was here, but the herb was a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: moist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told him to take it home and dry it
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's dried it out real good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crispy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it seems like we'll be able to see
the results along with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they're going to be pretty
good results because it's really nice
[SPEAKER_03]: herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the 120 going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: 73 I just hit?
[SPEAKER_03]: 73.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to hit it with the dabber?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to hit the 120.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hit it with the dabber.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think I'm risking it here right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going all out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to choke though,
so I might only do half.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you're going to choke.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a pretty wicked hit.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you should hit it all.
Champion.
[SPEAKER_03]: There she goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor saver really does make quite a
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we're looking forward to showing
you a little bit of that hash that John
[SPEAKER_03]: brought here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to photograph it with my macro
lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a really pretty thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be a popular shot already.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you flipped it upside down and
that's why we're not popping it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our good friend Mike,
who was on the show not too long ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: came with me, did a little boot up towards
Squamish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He brought me the God, the Oh God crossed
with the purple metallic haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some turps to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get you a rip of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what you think of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a congratulations on your new sun
hash, which has been really cool to
[SPEAKER_03]: receive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's pretty awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super melty and nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just presses into a most beautiful,
transparent.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's beautiful.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mine's still a little gooey.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe yesterday.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: His is like three or four months old.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not going to give me that whole
thing, are you?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for you, John.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_15]: John's ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, you're not going to give me
that whole thing, are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's just major boiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to share dads with good friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today is actually a sad day on the memory
banks for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the anniversary of my father and his
wife and their accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine years today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did that feel?
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you say to that, eh?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm speechless.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm speechless.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a great hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the Oh God purple metallic haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can taste the God bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you taste that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That very pronounced.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always compared it to that weird purple
gum that tasted like soap that they put in
[SPEAKER_03]: your mailbox in like the 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a marketing campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of you guys remember that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tasted like soap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Free gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Showed up in the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird Canadian thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be interesting to see if anyone
remembers that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect that we will have people that do
remember it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only that, they'll even name it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still recovering over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we go recover and we'll set it
up here so we can dry sift some of this
[SPEAKER_03]: bud real quick and then we'll whip off a
quick batch of the bubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so it's time to do a little
quick dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the two, I guess these would be
what, three feet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Two feet by two feet or is it one foot by
two foot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Two feet by one foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say these are.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pick them up at freshheadies.com
in the dry sift section and this is a 90
[SPEAKER_03]: lines per inch or mesh count and a 60
lines per inch or mesh count.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those numbers accord.
[SPEAKER_03]: 60 is a 250 and 90 is a 180.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're counter intuitive numbers from
Micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, these little screens offer a nice
ability to acquire a full melt dry sift,
[SPEAKER_03]: pure 99% gland heads in a really quick
amount of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got Johnny B's Astro Boy here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I figured we'd put a couple of handfuls of
that down.
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that ever smell awesome?
[SPEAKER_14]: And the fact that my hand is also now
smelling awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a real small amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: We dropped, you know, less than an ounce
onto the screen and we did it in a way
[SPEAKER_03]: where we really caused very little
friction whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just check it out to see what
fell through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a very, very small amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks almost all like just pure heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's put a little bit more on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know we've got, well, I guess I
could try to cart up the bottom first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll use the Method 7 sticker,
the good people at Method 7 sent over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's a super small amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Petty.
[SPEAKER_14]: Small.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do a little more.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I haven't crushed it yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll get some of this crush on there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the crush.
[SPEAKER_14]: So how long did you dry this for?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's actually been sitting in a
bowl since the last time I was here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which was what, a week or two ago?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, a week ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: Last Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was actually hanging for about two
and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Must have been two weeks ago because I
think my son was born on the last Puff
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it means.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would mean two weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: So last Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_12]: Before your son was born, sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was thinking out loud in my brain
without saying anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: Today I'm camera gunning.
[SPEAKER_12]: You are.
[SPEAKER_14]: Rocking it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so I haven't really broken up
the buds too much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just gonna have a gentle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a gentle.
[SPEAKER_12]: Packing it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, just to see what we got this time
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a bit more has fallen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really looks almost all glandular
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very small amount of contaminant there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I guess on the camera you can see
there's much more contaminant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we got off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's more visible there this time
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Color on that is quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, just, and you could do
that over and over and over again by
[SPEAKER_03]: moving the material gently.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we can also get that second batch
that's just sitting on top by just giving
[SPEAKER_14]: it a flick.
[SPEAKER_12]: The trick.
[SPEAKER_12]: A flick trick.
[SPEAKER_09]: And once again, you can now totally see
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: See how the canucks go this year since we
have the gold canucks?
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the different colors even though,
hey?
[SPEAKER_05]: See how the one's a little lighter?
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty sure there'll be some macrophores
on this.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to make some buds?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I think it's that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to dab up some of that first
dry sift that we just made?
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely do.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well the smaller pile is the A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you take that one?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna go for the A.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go for the A.
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to do that the other way around.
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's going to become a little
difficult for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I think you got this.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man, you got this.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: One hit here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I see too well in there,
but melted out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice taste.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can definitely, I'm getting used to
the taste of the Astro Boy now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Love the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got our energies back and we're
gonna make this hash, aren't we John?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna make some wicked fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got super bubbled up yesterday and it
was my, that anniversary of my dad and my
[SPEAKER_03]: step mom and it was just kind of,
I just wasn't feeling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I'm feeling it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's right here and ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've hit a couple of rips already
as you can tell by John's slur.
[SPEAKER_03]: The slur.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know what it was?
[SPEAKER_12]: It was actually, we went from this
beautiful God.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh God, purple metallic haze.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cross with some of course, Nettie Kush and
then we haven't even looked at this.
[SPEAKER_12]: What Flav left.
[SPEAKER_12]: What Flav left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flav was here earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't manage to get any film on him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was only here for half an hour,
but I am going to film with Flav in the
[SPEAKER_03]: near future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you will see an upcoming video of Flav
and his garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, there's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have seven years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven years.
Seven years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seven years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seven day early.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey,
[SPEAKER_15]: what might that be?
[SPEAKER_12]: Just crushing some of that over some
screens and are you going to do some fresh
[SPEAKER_12]: frozen?
[SPEAKER_12]: I say so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: So first we're doing some dry sifting with
some Astro Boy that I had and now we're
[SPEAKER_12]: going to run your fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this has been sitting in my freezer
for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like since before I went to Jamaica,
I think maybe even the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: First time from this summer's trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I actually have two bags in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured we can do all this in one run.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, 100%.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to be a decent little fresh
frozen run.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not huge.
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought we might have some My Little
Pony and I brought some My Little Pony
[SPEAKER_12]: fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to see.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a beautiful, beautiful herb.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: How many plants was this?
[SPEAKER_12]: Was this two or three?
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe two, maybe three.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even remember.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, that's actually.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was two actually for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ready to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just get to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think so, you know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got ice.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not the half moon ice that we talk
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not the best, but it is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a nice layer for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I just moved the hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: See that?
[SPEAKER_12]: You did a very good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just moved the hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: So something that I did is I just cropped
up the buds last time.
[SPEAKER_12]: That smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course.
[SPEAKER_12]: Organic growing only.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, some nice O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Subcool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Bad Boy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, because I've been growing that
out and it's given me some amazing
results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks, Ron.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank Ron's friend, who we had to go
to the house and pick up the murders.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we're going to layer ice on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the layers of ice, layers of herb,
layers of ice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Layers of herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do a bit of squishing on this,
because we're definitely going more in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not broken up too big either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most everything's down to a reasonable
size.
[SPEAKER_03]: A piece might still be.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a great job there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a while ago that I cut these
down, but you know, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just pop them in the freezer and wow,
they break up nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: The resin, you guys, like really,
you can see it glistering here right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all over my hands.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one thing I like.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Astro Boy, the Barbara.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I know.
[SPEAKER_12]: They all melt just so beautifully.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is just another one of those.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see the raw heads on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I always talk about a smell cam.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to have one of those coming up
one day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it will be a smell cam.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll be able to push a button.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll be able to smell a wee smell.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't that be cool?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: This one's crispy.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_12]: Coming out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: Crisp.
[SPEAKER_12]: Crisp and snappy.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, it's freshly frozen ice dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, this is, makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular batch of herb came out
nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Figured as he's doing that, I'm just going
to do this rip and maybe even pass it to
[SPEAKER_12]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take it brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good call.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're well-deserving of a rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you guys think Johnny B's
well-deserving of a rip?
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going for all of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're stuffing that bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So probably each bag weighs roughly,
I'm going to say, I bet you each bag's
[SPEAKER_12]: about a half a pound wet.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's probably a pound of wet.
[SPEAKER_12]: So probably looking at about a quarter
pound of dry, would you think?
[SPEAKER_12]: I bet you it's probably a hundred grams of
dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so you know what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can definitely see that that is some
killer, killer fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're always talking about this and I
don't, I've done it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_12]: You always got to make sure that you tie
this bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tie the zipper.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty darn important.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want the thing leaking out
into your, I mean, I still use a 220 bag
[SPEAKER_03]: as you can see in the bucket behind me.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, I was talking to you about that
because I haven't been, I mean,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, thinking the bag would do the job for
me, but I mean, uh, instructed no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I'm not instructing no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do as you please, but I think it was a
great advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if we can't get this ice to rub
some of that heat.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it doesn't melt that ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: More water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Melt things down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one missing bud.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll let you make the decision.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is what you should be doing with
your fresh buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's what John and I like to
do anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, a lot of people kind of can't
wrap their heads around it, but we always
[SPEAKER_03]: go back to the sort of education that
we're seeking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if you ordered pizza,
you want to eat the pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you're growing herb, you want to
use the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at how green that came in right away,
John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trippy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really trippy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well let's, uh, let's get her going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go for, what do you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Six, six to nine minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out with the smell of smell of
vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real nice color on it too.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the water that you drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is some turpeen rich bubble hash
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're definitely going to be taking a
sip of it once she's done mixing up and
[SPEAKER_12]: we're ready to pull the bags ready and we
got to turn the machine to the side.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to walk over here like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to set the bucket right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your actions, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this thing is, uh, just stopped
mixing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, wow, nice colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a good smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say that's fucking a good smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I guess rather than wait any
amount of time, cause we know there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: reason to leave that shit soaking in water
for longer than you need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can leave that down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just drop this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's going to get right up there
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sand being collected immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I can, uh, turn it in and show.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're used to seeing it all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've seen it so many times.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta love Johnny D.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are with the Congolese and some
sorrel plants from Jamaica with the Ortega
[SPEAKER_03]: in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thought I'd introduce everyone.
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't actually been formally used to
the Ortega yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not growing in my garden yet,
but the Congolese is doing amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely going to do another run
on this almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be loud and annoying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I guess we could just leave this
right now rather than, cause right now
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not in water.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll pull the bags and then we'll get
this guy running.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way they can kind of stick with us
while we're pulling the bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise it's that terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to take off the jacket and do some
work now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you got to do is pack bowls.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what the best part about this
actually is the reward you get from what's
[SPEAKER_12]: coming out of this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is us smoking the hatch when we're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is right here why I have an MMAR
license.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the entire purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I wouldn't say mainly, I would say
only to procure the triangular trichome
[SPEAKER_03]: heads.
Perfecto.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's just a little bit of
contaminant on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we could still collect though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always worth something showing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like stigma hairs mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I brought my spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't even know where I see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually have a little spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we'll see what happens today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be freezing what we get.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be frozen until probably
tomorrow and then it'll be microplained.
[SPEAKER_03]: 160 is pretty much empty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiny little bits of 160.
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost an insignificant amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually in these fresh frozen runs that
are very, you know, that they could be as
[SPEAKER_03]: low as 50 to 60 grams of dry material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show a ton of contaminant.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can't see that bucket there,
I can just put these directly back into
[SPEAKER_12]: the bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're going to be doing this again
right away.
[SPEAKER_12]: We do this right again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the one that should be using this
bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very tiny amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much like a dab, which is okay on this
bag, but I wouldn't want to see it on the
[SPEAKER_03]: next three.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one just needs to be rinsed first.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little rinsed.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now the 120, my color, as you can see
with the shirt that I'm wearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drinking slow.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess there'll be a little bit of
bubble in this one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can definitely see it from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little bit of bubbles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little bit of that nice creamy color.
120U.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the hash looks damn near orange when
you're flipping it around in the bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a nice big blob there, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a nice little blob for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: We do.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely knowing that we got a
little something going on.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's like you can actually see
all the resin that's floating inside the
[SPEAKER_12]: water here right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually pretty, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never taken a good look at it,
but as you pull that, you can just see all
[SPEAKER_12]: this.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can explain it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can definitely see it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's cool, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take a good look at your next water run
and take a look at the 90 water before you
[SPEAKER_12]: pull the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks almost like you're looking at a
lake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold that one, guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scissor rinse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: See that we can get that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great way to save heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any little bits that are on the,
on the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great way to get them off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially that 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the creaminess that it was,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to take it inside the bucket
for easy cleaning?
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: 90U.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is right here why I have a license.
[SPEAKER_10]: Almost in the bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the reason why I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love the orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the black.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the white.
[SPEAKER_02]: It puts a smile on my face some days.
[SPEAKER_03]: The black bag, the 90U.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a great bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is me wanting to help, but I'm just
going to not stay away.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little, little pile there of some
creamy goodness.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can definitely see a difference in
the water.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you can see it's less, like less
mercury.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got all that resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: We pulled out quite a bit, didn't we?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually, that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a real nice, like unbelievable
gooey pile of, like right now I'm jumping
[SPEAKER_12]: for joy inside.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually jumping for joy for him.
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can see the smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_12]: And just the yield is twice the size of
the 120 that we just pulled.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you know that that 73 is going to be
really nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say it's close to three times.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say three times.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just with the thickness of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a, it's a beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful sandy color.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do know that that's going to be some
picture taken quality right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to look really nice on the
walls.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to look so nice on the walls.
[SPEAKER_12]: So nice to be making a batch.
[SPEAKER_12]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at the sky out here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got Puff Wednesday.
First week of September.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Fowl is upon us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the 73 bag is the heaviest of the
three so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely, I've learned in genetics
that we are running right now are really
[SPEAKER_12]: heavy resin yielding.
[SPEAKER_12]: We do get really good quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited to be running the barb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the smell of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so incredible.
[SPEAKER_12]: Smell camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tasty.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at the way that came up too.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks purple almost.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you're color blind, but.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm seeing, uh, I'm looking at just the
way it's, uh, though the Y it looks pretty
[SPEAKER_12]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks to be like potentially more
than the 120.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then the 45, you know, was actually going
to be probably really good too.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be creamy and white.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all creamy and white.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the 90 and the 73 about the same,
maybe a little bit more than the 73.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you're going to be able to see all
this.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a little bit just great.
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can see, I'm always speechless when
I'm looking at just epic residents.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's those little minutes that I'm
just like, Oh wait, I was like pushing
[SPEAKER_12]: back and taking out the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I was passing it over, I could see the
niceness on the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I'm making a mistake here.
[SPEAKER_10]: 45 micron bag drained in about five
seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, there's a pile of cream.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's fun to bounce.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always balanced.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like to like bounce and look at it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like, for me, it's a, wow,
look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big old puck.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's more than a little puck.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a big puck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick little cleaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a little tiny bit on the bag and just
use water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny.
[SPEAKER_12]: The water goes through the screen and the
resin stays where you want it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice little.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a big, big batch.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice pulls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice pulls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any sort of clarity.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to keep them all in order.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the last thing I pulled off
this was Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anything's on here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful spoonful there, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's real nice and out.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long did you flush for on this one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Six weeks, I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: Six weeks of water?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: 42 days?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You did.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Doesn't show any difference with your
resin pressure.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just makes it melt better.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't need that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't need this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think this resin's all going to
really melt nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: Last bag, 25.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to hunker down for this one,
guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, it just smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: The screen here.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys can't see me off cam.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, they got you in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're in the cam.
[SPEAKER_10]: Halfway in, halfway out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the wide angle on, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the next thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing the best I can here.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're doing great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Taking it nice and slow.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a nice, relaxing puff line for Astro
Boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking it easy.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot going on in the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: Things are happening on a huge... Take a
look at what's happening all around the
[SPEAKER_12]: world with cannabis legalization,
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're awaiting all these cool things to
occur in the next upcoming year.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be just exciting to see.
[SPEAKER_12]: What will be exciting is when we can start
going from country to country and puffing
[SPEAKER_12]: on resin like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sharing our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're all able to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a lot of people are looking
forward to that one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're going to see it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got sticky hands from the last one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's water in here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to pour that water back in
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking of using that water.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty turp rich.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got some more ice over here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pour that back in there, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, we'll just clean this bag,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will put them all back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these two that we have right here will
be put in the freezer immediately,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I'm going to do right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I'm going to do, guys,
is I'm going to get right to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get right into putting these
bags right back in the bucket because
[SPEAKER_07]: we're doing the second round right away.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one thing I do find is when I'm doing
my second round, I find it easier to put
[SPEAKER_12]: the bags.
[SPEAKER_12]: So start with the 25 right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_12]: End with the 45.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we didn't show you this on the last
one.
But it's
[SPEAKER_12]: pretty easy, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: On that last little turn, I was a little
quick with things.
[SPEAKER_12]: My back is not doing a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: But as you can see, it's quite easy.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really non-stressful, long,
strenuous.
[SPEAKER_12]: By the time Merck gets back here,
we'll have these bags ready.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be able to turn on that machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, one thing I just did is I turned the
bag inside out.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I always want to have the label when
I'm folding to the outside, not to the
[SPEAKER_12]: inside, the way the bags are structured
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you're putting the bags in,
always make sure that when you fold it
[SPEAKER_12]: over, you see the bubble now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bubble bags, I should say.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has been easier for the resin to sit in
the bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't get caught on the lip.
[SPEAKER_09]: That would not be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, we are now moving
this
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty much done with that right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm jumping right in here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go with the My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some stuff that I ran, actually,
last Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_12]: I ran this as Merck was waiting for his
son to be born.
[SPEAKER_12]: I figure I was going to run some bubble
hush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B's hitting bulls.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple more bags and we'll do that in a
second.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I was working away, and then my back
was actually bothering me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So then I was like, OK, I'm just going to
do a rip right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, I think you were smart.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is the MLP.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a good dunk.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I did this one for about 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was definitely a good long flower
owner.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, but it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: How long did you take yours?
[SPEAKER_12]: How long did you take yours until the end?
[SPEAKER_12]: What did I do?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: How many weeks did you do?
[SPEAKER_12]: I did mine for like 14.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just pushed it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it could have came down.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm taking it down on day 63, day 70.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to find the one that would
best be.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, that turp water's nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got the bee right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's been hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a wasp.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to bite Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's just like, what's going on,
guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, can I have some of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B's not getting bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's landing on my hat.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's definitely sounding the turpies in
that water.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what he's after right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I want to put those other two bags
in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_12]: My hands are a little wet, so trying to
press open the hatch isn't working out
[SPEAKER_12]: that well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll get another batch going
here and mix them up.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just move that ice over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other batches in the freezer, freezing
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's plenty of ice inside here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might as well put the rest in there,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's where it does the most work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inside the bag?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: In contact with the herb.
[SPEAKER_12]: That Medi Kush is just so tasty.
[SPEAKER_12]: So is that My Little Pony, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, want to get that in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a goal of contact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that all three bags?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left one bag downstairs, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only brought up two.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, especially with this cold
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to squeeze that away for just a
second?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to ask you to carry this
because it's heavy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I looked at it twice, and all I did
was work around it.
Mm, that's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, shall we rock it out for
another six to nine minutes before time is
[SPEAKER_03]: done?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: They clicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went clickety-click.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went clickety-click.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do quickly need a little daffodil,
though.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to guess it's some type of an
OG.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I know Dave really likes his OGs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_12]: A little MK All-Tree.
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as he's doing that, I'm doing a
clicky-click.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got these guys quickly doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: More bubbly goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making bubbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water is incredibly cold.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm always excited to see the second run
to just see how much residue got off the
[SPEAKER_12]: first one.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for me, I did three runs there a couple
last week with Mike.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I realized is I so over-packed
everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I did three runs is because he
made mention to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we over-packed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no, you definitely didn't.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I'm thinking too is going to
be.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mine was over-packed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I could tell by the first run.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did learn that for the first time for
me, but just by getting excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only real bummer about that is the
exposure to the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what we have?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sure, because you're rubbing
terpenes from the water as you wash.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those terpenes are, I guess,
maybe on the gear here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flip it inside out and then closer down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, take it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're forced to be reckoned with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that I have just enough spots for
all my bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely less, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still quite nice looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give you that bubble you got when you
thought you were going to get the best,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you kind of got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You expect this as your second batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that 90 up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, that does look awesome to
let that go.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like losing a few more grams.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even want to lose the resin on the
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let alone.
[SPEAKER_12]: You would actually pull the bag and it
would be dry and ready to smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a new product.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm leaking them already.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's some new stuff that's going to
be coming out in the near future.
[SPEAKER_12]: The near could be within the next 25
years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't ever forget that.
[SPEAKER_12]: For 25 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the second run and it still
looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the flip.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, new screen.
[SPEAKER_12]: New screen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just move this over for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's just kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to show them that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're hiding it from me.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: The concentration.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm scooping up a fine, big bowl.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I smoke a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if I don't smoke it, it ends up in
my coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time I used 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put the barb dry sift of 99% heads.
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely do not smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: No?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you do with it?
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you make it into some products though?
[SPEAKER_12]: I throw it in the pizza there for a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot in the 420 pizza.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's different ways of getting it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just throw it into food at this point.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not decarboxylated yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: None of it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've got to heat it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I find with the stuff that doesn't burn
that well in the pipe, does great well in
[SPEAKER_12]: my food.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, edibles.
[SPEAKER_12]: And eating those cannabinoids help you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Edible friendly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Keeps everything moving properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so there's something to go over real
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you were say diagnosed and you
found out you were fairly ill and you were
[SPEAKER_03]: looking to answer the question,
what do I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting this question quite a bit
lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm telling people is that the
best thing really that I'm finding is to
[SPEAKER_03]: A, join the group on Facebook the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a group of people on there that
are sharing like-minded information,
[SPEAKER_03]: sharing information in regards to THC's
cancer shrinking properties and to CBD and
[SPEAKER_03]: different cannabinoid profiles and their
anti-seizure properties and so on and so
[SPEAKER_03]: forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one good spot to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in regards to what you do to actually
help yourself using cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: my answer is that you saturate your
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live in a dispensary friendly city,
that would mean acquiring salves and
[SPEAKER_03]: patches, sublingual drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would still vaporize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would consume a cannabinoid infusion of
either the Rick Simpson's oil or a bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: hash infused coconut oil or any variety.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's all kinds of varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the main point is that if you've been
diagnosed with something serious and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're quite ill, you would want to eat a
good solid gram of those pure
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically a gram of bubs a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that involves removing a carboxylic
acid ring from the molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So THC A becomes delta
tetrahydrocannabinoid and CBD A becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the different D acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Removing that molecule activates these
cannabinoids and this is how you can
[SPEAKER_03]: really improve the quality of the health
of your body.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's basically what you want to eat.
[SPEAKER_12]: When the hash would come around,
I wouldn't be eating the 45.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be eating the 73 and the 90 and the
20.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you want to look at the saturation of
THC and that's what they talk about with
[SPEAKER_12]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's really, you can do it with the
Rick Simpson oil as you can do with some
[SPEAKER_12]: people making it with grain alcohols or
vodka.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's all different ways of stripping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you and I make it with screens.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we do it with screens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, often coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to be a real nice sort of natural
way that the dry sift and the wet wash
[SPEAKER_03]: melts just so nicely into the heated
coconut oil, decarboxylates it and then
[SPEAKER_03]: allows you to either put it on your skin
or eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it on your pizza, anything you want,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it dabs up, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit a little of this bubble
that my friend Mike gave me as a
[SPEAKER_02]: celebration of the birth of my son.
[SPEAKER_12]: A week old.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did they have a one week birthday party?
[SPEAKER_12]: They had a two week birthday party?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good way of actually having,
you know, I'm going to celebrate every
[SPEAKER_12]: week because those first weeks are
important.
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus then you get more gifts.
[SPEAKER_12]: A hidden gift, didn't know about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first thing he said, well,
let's pump it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still haven't taken a bow.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fed me a few puffs of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I fed you a few puffs of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I, myself, I'm going to be hitting the MLP
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Loving the bub hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Loving the fact that we just whipped off
another batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to freeze it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be frozen for some
several hours and then I'll microplane it
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show that off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do some macro photographs of
the hash before and after microplaning and
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully some melt videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're puffing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Always.
[SPEAKER_15]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just get some of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get some of this water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm holding, I was holding the mothership
like up like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm watching that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, well, you know, that's safe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Medi sedating.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to put you to sleep.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to give you the MLP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, the MLP.
[SPEAKER_12]: The MLP.
[SPEAKER_12]: This was for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like just pouring it in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a little pour and you're not going to
see what's in there, but we have a,
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to grab it, but it's kind of
what's left in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was full.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe we just whipped off two
batches of bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the terpene rich water.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my personal product right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be pouring that into my plants and
we'll see whether or not there's any real
[SPEAKER_03]: ability for a plant to uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a way for a plant to uptake its,
its intake of a particular thing to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce more terpenes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if we understood it, it's
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't pretend to understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hash on the back of that tab.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a bigger piece there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you realize that?
[SPEAKER_12]: As I'm putting lids on here as that one's
picked up and flips upside down.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So here we're going to double the top and
bottom.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to probably cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're doing here on bubble
man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see that the weather's kind of
coming back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was miserable and rainy yesterday when
we did our dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We decided against making the bubble batch
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes like mints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mints.
Old school hash.
Nice.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Old school.
I'm trying not to cough here.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're doing a great job, John.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what else do we got?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get to chill while that happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hash waits to freeze.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like I say, Puff Puff Pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do some Puff Puff Passing and we'll
see you guys back in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to the beach?
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to smoke that hash joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to take the camera?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, push the button to start this car.
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?
[SPEAKER_14]: Which button?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this one that says start engine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mine's up here.
[SPEAKER_12]: You even have a key spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your wife's car.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's telling you to put on your seatbelt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely a seatbelt warning thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was watching this screen right here,
guys, so I can kind of give you an idea
[SPEAKER_12]: what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_12]: This guy's killing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's killing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is killing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, I was going to give you this
for the birth of my son instead of a
[SPEAKER_03]: cigar.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you feel like puffing it down
at the water, so be it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take it home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it home?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: You brought two, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess I'm puffing this joint.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what not better time to puff it up?
[SPEAKER_12]: What time is it right now?
[SPEAKER_12]: Boy, it's 4.59.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's almost 4.20 somewhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: We might be lighting this at 5.10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: 5.10.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the birth time of my son.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we made it to the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess John's decision is that he is
going to puff his puff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pure hash joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not sure if we're going to go
over and do it on the dock or if we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to sit down here on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess we'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I made a decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: That tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: You made a decision?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That we should puff this joint within the
next seven, eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can do it up the window.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Johnny and I came down to the Oceane,
Pacific Ocean, the Howe Sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's looking pretty beautiful out there
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of wishing my boat was in the
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: What better place to smoke this pure hash
joint?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got yourself all sorted with a
lighter and everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two tubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always looking forward to a pure hash
joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially on a puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a week since your son was born.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're at about this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we're at about 5.10 right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, 5.09.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spock it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything just works in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Considering Wednesday at 5.10,
one week ago, I was having a Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: 5.10, there it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: 5.10, there it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations on a healthy one week old
baby boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just happened that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was really planned.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just ended up down here as we spent the
last 10 minutes trying to find a spot to
[SPEAKER_04]: even light the joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wanted to get this beautiful view in the
background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so nice out there today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to be out on the boat on a calm
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like today, it's good to go seek out
whales and dolphins and different pods of
[SPEAKER_03]: cool different fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Salmon will be coming in, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the trap and crab and prawn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prawn, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Docks even pretty empty.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not that many boats on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wish my boat was in the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, an idea maybe you could
share what you guys do on a puff Wednesday
[SPEAKER_04]: with us in the comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, tell us how you guys enjoy your puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys inspired to do something
special on Wednesday and get out there and
[SPEAKER_03]: puff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us some inspiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can go do something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we don't want to just sit in front
of the same old same old spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we try and come down to different
venues, show you an area that maybe you
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't seen before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I can't believe how resinous my mouth
is just from lighting this joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one thing about just puffing on
really nice resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking to lots of boats.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked about that with a lot of
people lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's asking more and more questions
on the bubble hash, on hash, on the
[SPEAKER_04]: tri-combs, how it's better for different
ecstasies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's a lot of good
information that people want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you just want to come and puff a
bowl and maybe catch a good tip here and
[SPEAKER_03]: there, puff Wednesday is always a good
spot to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect little hole in the ash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to show this, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: I turned around and saw that and put a big
smile on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And just the way the wind hits it,
it's like, it's making me upstart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what usually happens after
about two or three puffs on a pure hash
[SPEAKER_03]: joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, it's, I always say really,
it's an ideal thing for, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 people can each get like two or three
really nice rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, or sometimes maybe just
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: As they know, you've probably seen it on
the channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I could almost swim today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of swimming, there's kids
swimming just literally on the other side
[SPEAKER_03]: of where we're hanging out right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised we can't hear them screaming
and yelling.
[SPEAKER_04]: She would be nice though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe what a gorgeous day it
turned out to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we've had some bad weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, about sure we've had really bad
weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say it's more like just, we had a
couple of days of rainy, which I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: think we've had many in the entire summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of was necessary to turn
around, but it's nice that even today it
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't seem like it was going to be that
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better when it's left on the joint
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well it'll just, uh, it'll protect the
cherry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of cools it down and it burns a
little slower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you'll get that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll heat up a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a cigar in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get the big cherries on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes they let the ash build up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure if you guys have heard that
technique before letting the ash build up
[SPEAKER_03]: and creating a bit of a cooling effect on
the cherry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of more like a muffler.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like halfway through this hash
joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how, you know, building up that,
that, um, that ash to cool down the joint
[SPEAKER_04]: is, uh, something I never really thought
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was little things that we learned,
little tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of makes sense because after he
said that I took a nice little pull and it
[SPEAKER_04]: burned my lips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was even the first etiquette of
those hash joints from the first video.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always said, don't, don't ash it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, often it'll pull the cherry off and if
it doesn't pull the cherry off,
[SPEAKER_03]: it just seems to make the cherry that much
hotter, but it's still tasting great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hash joint is just in perfect shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a nice treat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great way to, to puff a big sesh in
public.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're surrounded.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people working on boats over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a marine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, right over here, of course,
there's not much behind us in the sense of
[SPEAKER_03]: people, but a lot of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, this, this is like pulling
up a rig and dabbing like Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've literally got a gram of hash that
we're burning off here and we're about two
[SPEAKER_03]: thirds of the way through it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can definitely get the effects right
now.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's helping with after my foot got
crushed in the rock down there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was laughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's okay because I just couldn't
believe that he steps on a rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: This huge rock and it just twists fully
sideways, slides his foot into a crevasse
[SPEAKER_03]: and then crushes up against his foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wasn't really screaming.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of like, Oh, Oh, he's just
kind of like the character that he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that big ash that we got on there
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't touched it.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's up to you now.
[SPEAKER_12]: It falls off on its own nature.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then that's just like, you know,
it's just the way things happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when you drop the joints and catch it
in your hand, you do seem to knock the ash
[SPEAKER_12]: off.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just because we're being so delicate
with it because you feel this is getting
[SPEAKER_04]: more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, this is, this is when it
becomes destroyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you find at one point that it breaks in
your fingers, you can no longer pass it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the best thing I can say
about the hash joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you have a pipe, if you have a
pipe, that's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't have a pipe and you're
puffing, on one of these hash joints and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're towards the last little bit,
the roach, you know, the one 10th or the
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting a real strong wind coming
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Giving them shotgun rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn the weight of the wind and you get a
shotgun rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shotgun rips on the ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get warm on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: The crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be transferring fingers too
much at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's damn near done.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what a great joint that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what it is?
[SPEAKER_04]: It stays in my fingers now because don't
pass it once it's cracked.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, don't pass it once it's cracked.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finish it off, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shotgun rips all the way through here,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's for the finishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here comes a kayaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, fucking beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love living in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: BC living is what we call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: BC living.
[SPEAKER_03]: This winter we're going to take you,
or I'm going to take you in bubble man's
[SPEAKER_03]: world up to Whistler, Pemberton.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do back country,
Blackcomb and Whistler Mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do the back country
Pemberton ice caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do Brandywine, Brombridge
and Squamish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get you guys into some different
zones on the sleds, snowboard skis,
[SPEAKER_03]: ski flying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to show you guys a little bit of
this winter activity that I usually get
[SPEAKER_03]: into and just how good it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great bubble and the whole cannabis scene
fits right into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, a lot safer than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice job, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puffing that down to almost nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the way the wind's really giving it
rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even have to suck on that to get
a rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going right down to the nitty
gritty to the last little rip.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you can see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's your smokey tokey.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great puffing with you on Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got resin freezing in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we don't get it till later today,
until tomorrow, we'll get it then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to thank everyone for watching
bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do you say?
[SPEAKER_11]: Puff, puff, pass.
[SPEAKER_11]: Puff, puff, pass.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I looked over and I could see this
little bit of smoke coming up out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: zone.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is what we call organic,
guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: That little tiny piece won't go out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It will just smolder away.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can't hold that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to burn my fingers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guys, bubble man here back with the
final process.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most important process of making water
hash, the breaking up of the final patty
[SPEAKER_03]: into powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got my 120 patty right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice and frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to talk too much because
the freezing is an extremely important
[SPEAKER_03]: factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my 25 parchment or sorry,
my 120 parchment here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically clean a little bit of resin on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've cleaned my micro planer, which isn't
the greatest of micro planers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have the strongest little bite
to it, but it'll have to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also lost my gloves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise I would be holding this with
with my gloves right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is this is really breaking up
lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just starting to get sticky on my
hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I probably could have broken her down
into a smaller piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out absolutely white.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just starting now to stick to my fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is great because I've pretty much
got it micro planed down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll a few little bumpies into the corner
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So super important to make sure that you
get these pieces down as small as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: These little pieces that are stuck on my
fingers, of course, probably won't dry
[SPEAKER_03]: properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just a few little rips and I'll
I'll just hit those on the D now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sizzle time, as I call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that little bit of sizzle.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've gotten myself a tiny little bit of
a bubble stuck on my fingers here,
[SPEAKER_03]: as you can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I would suggest for this is into
the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: My fingers go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll leave them there for an hour and then
I'll pull them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that with this tool right here,
which has a little bit of hash stuck on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give that a little bit of a whack and then
even the finger that's got all the resin
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can be cleaned over top of the micro
planing tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
Whoops.
[SPEAKER_03]: No resin shall be lost in the making of
this hash or harmed for that reason,
[SPEAKER_03]: for that matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come off real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably because I'm sitting in a nice,
cool morning rather than the hot warmth of
[SPEAKER_03]: the sun that I often like to show you guys
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just give you a little little breakdown
on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could have been a little more even here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have dried it out a little more
evenly, but it's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've got my little chunks over
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, horse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannot tell you how great the smell on
this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to close up the 120 box and
we're going to move on to the 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, this is just the first run as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did end up getting two runs of each.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So time for the 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little remnants of some other awesome
Melty hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Medi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's break off a little of that 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see how absolutely stunning that
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be cleaning real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suggest using smaller pieces when you're
planing so it doesn't heat up on your
[SPEAKER_03]: fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stayed cool right to the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause my fingers are sticky free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squirrel's getting stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, he's doing the 90.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting pretty excited too.
[SPEAKER_14]: The smell on this is flavorful.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little hand switcher upper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Corner up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice pile of 90 right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I left very little on the tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of the key.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you leave on the tool,
the more eventually the less it'll work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a tiny little bit in there,
but for the most part you can see I got
[SPEAKER_03]: the job done.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because this was in the freezer the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 90U getting put away.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll move on to the 73.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So time for the 73.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see I've got the 73 Micron written
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then each time I do a new crop,
I just write in the date and what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done three other Astro Boys on this
one and a Medi Kush, two other Astro Boys
[SPEAKER_03]: and a Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be the third.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the parchment lined in the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to break this 73 in half.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already becoming a goopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at the way the light shine
through that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that pretty?
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's getting excited down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must know I'm microplaning the 73.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually one of the nice things about
this microplaner because it isn't quite as
[SPEAKER_03]: sharp as some of the other models.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost shaved down the last few
pieces just with your fingers while doing
[SPEAKER_03]: no damage to your finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is looking real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: 73, 73 he's saying.
73.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiny little bit of moisture on your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiny little bit of little moisture can
just make that excess sticky, sticky resin
[SPEAKER_03]: roll off without actually sticking onto
your finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see that's pretty, pretty good
for just having manhandled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, one more little piece here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out so white, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks quite a nice amber color in chunks,
but I'll tell you once it gets down to
[SPEAKER_03]: being microplanned.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very nice blonde color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still clean on the fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: No skin popping off into the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the 73 done.
[SPEAKER_03]: 45 and 25 left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll go and microplane the second
run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like the second run is a little,
a little bit more than half the return.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say maybe two thirds, maybe a little
bit between a half and two thirds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to put this one away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, actually it sounds like there might
still be some hash in this one from last
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, would you look at that?
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time to get this onto the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks rather fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be Astro Boy, which is exactly
what's going in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easily picked up off the parchment,
which is what I hear everyone saying all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're quite stoked about the parchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks absolutely delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been in here for months.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time I made bubble was quite some
time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have to check on the channel actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably only been a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or three weeks, but to me it feels like a
month or months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to go get the 45.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do exclusive 45 in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's quite a bit better of a
quality than the 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm also going to dab a little
bit of this 45 because it looks so darn
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went and grabbed our 45 patty.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, it's been in the freezer all night
and it is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a nice 45 patty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to break it into a few chunks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was quite a nice snap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly because I don't want it warming up
in my fingers before I have the chance to
[SPEAKER_03]: microplane it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This piece is really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wanting to warm up in my fingers,
but staying cool right down to the last
[SPEAKER_03]: piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it is also helpful, which I'm just
noticing now, particularly with this 45,
[SPEAKER_03]: to have that tiny little bit of moisture
on the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw when I held up the piece,
it had almost like a little frozen water
[SPEAKER_03]: on the outside of the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is quite a helpful thing,
particularly for keeping the hash from
[SPEAKER_03]: sticking to your fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the tool, a tiny little bit of
moisture is the key.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that it's the key in sieving and
of course it's going to be the key in
[SPEAKER_03]: microplaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming out very light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Microplaning up just lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of the part right here that
you're watching this sort of last awkward
[SPEAKER_03]: part that many people have the most
problem with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I'm going to show you all
of it in all of its awkwardness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, you can mix it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can wear the rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, you know, I'm going to be
photographing my resin to clarify that it
[SPEAKER_03]: won't be full of skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell it's not full of skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: My fingers haven't released any skin and
it all looks good from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This 45 is definitely releasing some
lovely terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's relatively clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting to come up a tiny little bit on
the outside here on this side,
[SPEAKER_03]: which would show me that it's time for a
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's best to keep your tools clean and not
to try and, you know, force the batch over
[SPEAKER_03]: a dirty tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll clean this tool before I microplane
the 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do I clean it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I clean it with a little bit of 99%
isopropanol and that pretty much gets the
[SPEAKER_03]: job done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to bark there, bud?
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear the other dogs barking?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're feeling it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't hold back.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice batch of 45.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Grammys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last up is the 25, which I'm going to put
in the 190, 160 box because what I ended
[SPEAKER_03]: up getting for 190 and 160 was literally
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to take a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a little stain on the pressing
screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up, 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got the last, of course,
there's a swack of hash on here too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only on bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You forget that you have, this looks
really good actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks more like a 45 or even a 120 than
a 160 and a one.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll keep that for later too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bonus.
[SPEAKER_14]: I should open my pizza boxes more often.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has been curing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got the 25 micron there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful color on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real nice and light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caramelly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to do a light microplane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've cleaned the microplane.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, crystal clear.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just planning to perfection.
[SPEAKER_14]: As I assumed it would.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice even spread when you're doing this is
very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still, you know, without the closing of
the box, I don't think I would use the
[SPEAKER_03]: parchment by itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just here in the Pacific Northwest,
we really have a humidity problem and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: hard to dry bubble properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I find that that's why I never would
put it on a plate or a, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: any type of plastic or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to go on a desiccant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't mind this with the box that
closes over it because then it still gets
[SPEAKER_03]: the effect of the desiccant without even
being directly in contact with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everyone else is happy too,
because picks up so nice off the
[SPEAKER_03]: parchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's the 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our variety of, uh, gland sizes
microplained up, boxed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no dust, debris, hair, whatever the
wind, whatever it can't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the box.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take these now and I'll go put them
in a room.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be about 65 degrees
Fahrenheit with a humidity of about 20%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a dehumidifier on and, uh,
I'll probably let this dry for the next
[SPEAKER_03]: five to seven days, depending on if,
uh, my friends don't show up from the,
[SPEAKER_03]: from the Seattle Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: If Giddy and Tony and Bird show up and
Jibs, uh, then we are dipping into the
[SPEAKER_03]: fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, I hope you guys learned a
little something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's my little guy crying in the
background.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to go, but if you have
any questions, throw them down as a,
[SPEAKER_03]: as a comment here in the, um, comment
section on the YouTube page and I will do
[SPEAKER_03]: my best to answer them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple process, water extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know where to go for your water
extraction needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can call us at 1-866-MELTING.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can check us up at this link right
here, actually, which is, uh, freshheadies
[SPEAKER_03]: .com.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got you covered for anything you
need in regards to sifting or wet washing
[SPEAKER_03]: or basically isolating gland heads.
