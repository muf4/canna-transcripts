[SPEAKER_00]: of yeah right on there we go welcome
everybody welcome to bubble man's world
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome to the wake and bake episode 68 in
the house and today we're going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: away something a little different we're
going to give away an mtg hat it's uh grow
[SPEAKER_00]: big or grow home i kind of left this hat i
had one myself that fit perfect i lost it
[SPEAKER_00]: in jamaica in kingston i remember driving
in this guy's car and uh we had all the
[SPEAKER_00]: windows open at one point my hat blew off
inside his car and it went right to the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of the car not the back seat but the
back and i was all excited getting dropped
[SPEAKER_00]: off at a buddy's house in uptown kingston
we were going to go dirt bike riding which
[SPEAKER_00]: i made a video of and it's on bubble man's
world anyway i never went back and got the
[SPEAKER_00]: hat so i lost it so i'm going to give this
one away today it doesn't fit me it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: seven and three eights all right seven and
three eights this means don't guess the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer if your head is way bigger or way
smaller i mean unless you just really kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of want a hat but i'd love to see this hat
go to someone that actually fits their
[SPEAKER_00]: head keegan someone like keegan or someone
else whatever i'm good to go with whoever
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to win it um and the question is
going to be simple i want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that the question i'm looking
for is specific meaning that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: abbreviate if you use a different term if
you don't say exactly what i said in the
[SPEAKER_00]: video that i'm about to link you with um
it's not going to be a win so those of you
[SPEAKER_00]: whose size hat this is all right all right
all right i know it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible to get everyone else to stop
guessing as well but i really would be
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointed if someone wins this hat and
it sits uh you know under a in a box under
[SPEAKER_00]: a desk somewhere much like this one's been
sitting for probably over a year now so
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm about to tell you what the video was
off-thread the video that we are looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for today is called marcel x depi fab egg
depi is spelled with two p's you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to find that on bubble man's world it
has 13 466 views and within the first
[SPEAKER_00]: minute of the video in the first minute of
the video i pull out a white little tub
[SPEAKER_00]: with some something something in it i want
to know what's in it i want to know the
[SPEAKER_00]: name and i want to know uh the micron so
anyone that is going to put up that will
[SPEAKER_00]: win this hat and then we'll get ourselves
uh wake and baked here what do you say all
[SPEAKER_00]: right let's do this he's got the poutine
on the j rolled i'm firing it up i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: firing it up yes david t with congolese 90
micron uh bingo you were close but you
[SPEAKER_00]: said congo and i wanted the specific name
that i said uh congolese 90 micron that's
[SPEAKER_00]: uh that's what it is it's the congolese
mighty micron um 90 micron dave is the
[SPEAKER_00]: winner um yeah dave if you want to give me
an email at bc bubble man at icloud.com i
[SPEAKER_00]: will send you this beautiful hat yes i
will send you this beautiful hat so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's that we've given away something
why don't we get now to the puffing i had
[SPEAKER_00]: the west coast guys well the east coast
guys i guess they're the east coast guys
[SPEAKER_00]: now they got their new packaging here if
you guys are out in toronto they brought
[SPEAKER_00]: some larry lemon larry og flower rosin
which was okay pretty pretty nice you know
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit dark for my likes but uh
that's okay they also brought me their
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate i'm not a distillate guy but
they wanted me to check it out and uh i
[SPEAKER_00]: was probably gonna do a little
experimenting with adding some turps to
[SPEAKER_00]: this i won't be puffing on it but we'll
see what my friends think and so that is
[SPEAKER_00]: their distillate right there quite clear
almost no color to the west coast east
[SPEAKER_00]: coast distillate and there is that um oh
yeah they also sent me uh this little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of butter uh rosin which is also very nice
it's barely sitting on there so it could
[SPEAKER_00]: slip off so we have all sorts of lovely
options for puffing this morning yeah west
[SPEAKER_00]: coast are good guys i met with uh uh jimmy
and brett from west coast yesterday and we
[SPEAKER_00]: had a nice little conversation and it was
good to see those guys because they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been out uh out on the east coast for the
longest time oh i don't really smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical solvent extracts myself i'm not a
big uh distillate bho hexane propane uh
[SPEAKER_00]: guy okay josh warner see you later have a
good one but at the same time uh i would
[SPEAKER_00]: sure fight for someone's right to uh
presumably there's no solvent list
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate well that's correct in a sense
um most solvent all distillates that i
[SPEAKER_00]: know of are washed with solvents like
ethanol or something and then run through
[SPEAKER_00]: short path molecular distillation units
the problem is is if it's been sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: with pesticides you can't get them out
what's going on brad k oh look at that i
[SPEAKER_00]: got some torch torch action here here's
your best dry sift tip geez i don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: man get great material i mean it couldn't
be better than that use exceptional
[SPEAKER_00]: material i i couldn't give you a better
dry sift tip than that honestly like that
[SPEAKER_00]: is as accurate as it gets don't bother
fucking around with garbage it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: waste of time energy and uh not worth it
really most distillate is made from
[SPEAKER_00]: complete garbage well let's just be honest
a lot of distillate is made from complete
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage um not all of it but a lot of it
is uh i've known a lot of people that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know trying to get that prohibition dollar
back out of cannabis as cannabis was
[SPEAKER_00]: lowering the price and as we were getting
these great prices you know the oil game
[SPEAKER_00]: stepped right up and said hey guess what
we'll still take those prohibition prices
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's still pretty high up there but
luckily you know once people start making
[SPEAKER_00]: this on a larger agricultural uh level um
we'll have the price go down obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to be this expensive
forever i'm sure some people would love it
[SPEAKER_00]: to be but um it's just not going to be the
case there's two many options all right
[SPEAKER_00]: what am i looking for i'm looking for one
of my glass there we go give thanks to
[SPEAKER_00]: nish give thanks to spacewalk i think i'll
rock the spacewalk right now all right
[SPEAKER_00]: silicone gel filter sharks for real good
morning samuel good morning i'm about to
[SPEAKER_00]: make some sausage gravy and biscuits says
chase figgins all right well we won't keep
[SPEAKER_00]: you we shot to keep you wake and bake guys
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah tyler he's a cutie
[SPEAKER_00]: it was really amazing that he let me do it
i uh i spent 12 hours with him yesterday
[SPEAKER_00]: at the beach and all over the place and we
had a great time nothing better than uh
[SPEAKER_00]: you know spending time with the youth such
amazing inspirations
[SPEAKER_00]: all right for completely white heads one
gram dab one gram dab oh my god i couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: think of something more waste worthy than
taking one grab dab right now but i will
[SPEAKER_00]: take a nice little rip of this uh what was
it master kush or paula pierra paul pierra
[SPEAKER_00]: is the strain on that one and the other
cultivar was oh yeah the lemon larry the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon larry all right hey it's not a waste
if you love it and it's for you and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want it i just i'm not i have zero
interest in taking one gram dabs like zero
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe when i was 17 i'd have been all over
that shit lemon larry for the win let's
[SPEAKER_00]: get our dabs up shall we everybody talk a
little bit about what's going on in the in
[SPEAKER_00]: the community these days you know as they
want to legalize decriminalize whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to call it yes 800 grams keegan
that's not dry no why don't you go on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website because you're going to fuck that
up the website says everything the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: weights are very simple 56 grams for a one
gallon 200 grams for a five gallon 1000
[SPEAKER_00]: grams for a 20 gallon so those are dry
weights now you multiply by four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: those dry weights to get the weight of
fresh frozen that you would run in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same size kit so you're confusing the five
gallon wet fresh frozen with dry so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very important not to confuse those
numbers because wow can that ever fuck you
[SPEAKER_00]: up and i don't want you to have uh have a
fuck up there like that yeah chat does
[SPEAKER_00]: move pretty quick well that's right you
heard it backwards but i for sure probably
[SPEAKER_00]: did not say it backwards because uh well
this is just one of those things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: i don't really i just know it it's like
ingrained in me i know it like i know
[SPEAKER_00]: anything oh yeah i've been watching that
as well track home city
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't have anything positive to say
sometimes it's best not to say anything at
[SPEAKER_00]: all mark's very opinionated he's got
strong opinions and i guess he said some
[SPEAKER_00]: negative things about um the lgptq
community which obviously is you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to be saying anything negative
about any community regardless of whether
[SPEAKER_00]: you see their way or not whether you agree
with it or not you just have to uh let
[SPEAKER_00]: people live their life i mean honestly i'm
down with whatever people want to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: as um you know if they want to identify as
a man as a woman as a fucking lion i
[SPEAKER_00]: support it it doesn't affect me it's uh
you know just support people let people do
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want to do you know you know
people so are so worried about the world
[SPEAKER_00]: changing and the world is changing the
world is not going to be recognizable in
[SPEAKER_00]: the next 20 to 30 years for a lot of
people that live in it so you know just do
[SPEAKER_00]: you just do you and don't worry about uh
about anyone else that's right roger cobb
[SPEAKER_00]: live and let live i think it's a fairly
simple method a fairly simple rule to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow i do plan to make another pure hash
joint video stoner smurf you know i think
[SPEAKER_00]: the next one will be out on a boat and
maybe we'll smoke like five or six of them
[SPEAKER_00]: we are indeed the pioneers of change yes
yes exactly j plot and we don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting anyone's survival health
well-being or freedom happiness whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: those things are um and we don't really
you know like it's sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_00]: unnecessary i mean often it's unnecessary
to say something that's just hurtful and
[SPEAKER_00]: mean for no good reason i mean why would
you do it why would you do it you know i
[SPEAKER_00]: guess because we're insecure and when we
get insecure we lash out uh we say
[SPEAKER_00]: negative things we become uh well we
become the fallible human beings that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are are the hash joints six star oh gosh
no bingo you could never smoke a six star
[SPEAKER_00]: hash hash joint it would melt right off
the tip the hash joints are specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed with a lower grade of hash like a
160 or 120 dry sift uh mixed in with some
[SPEAKER_00]: nice bubble and he's got the ratio right
down for producing the perfect paper that
[SPEAKER_00]: he then rolls into which becomes the hash
split the paper of course is made out of
[SPEAKER_00]: hash he flattens it out and i'm not sure
if he's rolling it over a toothpick or
[SPEAKER_00]: what exactly he's doing i've asked him on
a few occasions if he wanted to share the
[SPEAKER_00]: the technique and the method and he was
kind of a little bit leery but maybe one
[SPEAKER_00]: day we'll get him in the least i will be
ordering some more of those joints in the
[SPEAKER_00]: near future and doing a video i still
can't believe there's over a million views
[SPEAKER_00]: on that video uh just from sitting at my
desk one day and smoking a hash joint you
[SPEAKER_00]: never know through social media how many
people you can touch um i mean i'm happy
[SPEAKER_00]: to touch 100 to 200 of you each uh well i
guess it ends up being a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand two to three three thousand each
uh wake and bake video but uh that's i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: happy with that so you can imagine when
you get um suddenly get something like 1.3
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.4 million people that is an enormous
amount of people much larger than the
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of like a stadium that the rolling
stones would sell out or even like one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those russian concerts that metallica
would sell out four or five hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand people 1.3 1.2 million people
it's just uh well shanzo i think we know
[SPEAKER_00]: enough i think we know each other well
enough now that you can just let me have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little touch bud don't you think just a
little touch come on man don't be so don't
[SPEAKER_00]: be so uh prude are you prude let's have
another bong rip i think uh and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: finish it off it's a short one 14 minutes
gave a little something away dropped a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of knowledge not too much today
the hash knowledge will come i'm still
[SPEAKER_00]: writing the blog if you can imagine yeah
still writing this blog so this should
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully go up i'm down to the 45 micron
bag so once i get all the bags emptied
[SPEAKER_00]: i'll now start going through the process
of how to break it up properly and then
[SPEAKER_00]: how to dry it properly it's gonna be
pretty good and what else what else what
[SPEAKER_00]: else oh shit you know i should say rip to
mickey martin i never really knew mickey
[SPEAKER_00]: martin to me he seemed like this real kind
of trolly internet character that was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like trolling everyone at epic levels but
apparently he was a really amazing guy a
[SPEAKER_00]: family man a proponent of medical cannabis
and after seeing so many of my friends in
[SPEAKER_00]: the community say nice things about him in
his passing of course which was crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: because you just it's wild to sort of see
like here you got mark emery saying a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of ignorant shit to fuel the whole
community to hate him and he's got lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: people jumping on him right now for the
some of the comments that he made they're
[SPEAKER_00]: even jumping on jody it's kind of harsh
actually because she never made the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments but um yeah they're jumping all
over mark and in the meantime this guy
[SPEAKER_00]: mickey who was very much a troll like
character like he was a troll on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet he had the fuck mickey awards if
you can imagine which mark of course won
[SPEAKER_00]: many years in a row um it was just
interesting to see i guess when we pass we
[SPEAKER_00]: just everyone's gonna say the nicest
things about us and so mickey had some
[SPEAKER_00]: really incredible things to say uh they
had some incredible things to say about
[SPEAKER_00]: mickey so rip and i raise my bong to you
mickey i never really knew you didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the connection with you thought you were
an internet troll but uh it turns out that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were a real cannabis activist and uh
we thank you for the work you did and
[SPEAKER_00]: really you know our thoughts go out to
your family and friends that you left
[SPEAKER_00]: behind never good passing away and leaving
people behind that's kind of sad but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: the uh sort of circle of life as we say so
let's load it up for mickey rip mickey i
[SPEAKER_00]: was kind of scared of him i'm not gonna
lie i was kind of like i hope i don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: on this guy's radar and have him start
trolling me incessantly but uh i've
[SPEAKER_00]: attracted a few good ones over the year
yes rest well mickey abraham espinoza i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna change something in the matrix yeah
we're gonna do a bong rip for mickey
[SPEAKER_00]: that's right and i guess you know while we
do a bong rip for mickey we will also use
[SPEAKER_00]: his hashtag fuck mickey which uh yeah
there you go daniel walsh i heard a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing stories like that that mickey
really went out of his way to help people
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and that's to me the sort of
foundation of a great cannabis activist
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in this world of of you know
it's for the patients it's for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: it's nice to see people like that
regardless of how they're coming across on
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet you know being a real solid
human being off the internet and helping
[SPEAKER_00]: people that's uh i mean come on what more
can you ask for in a person are your turps

federal level mitch and i can both grab
[SPEAKER_00]: our cannabis our cuts our seeds our hash
whatever we have and fly to the center of
[SPEAKER_00]: canada meet in winnipeg and uh legally
federally have our product with us flying
[SPEAKER_00]: through the airport security the whole
nine yards that's really really awesome i
[SPEAKER_00]: hope to see it happen in the rest of the
world uh the rest of the world is uh owes
[SPEAKER_00]: it with our own it yeah i'd love to come
to vancouver island tricom city always
[SPEAKER_00]: always um oh listen lindsay listen lindsay
i got some exciting news i am trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: manifest a reality where i get ron to move
from the kootenays come out to the west
[SPEAKER_00]: coast and possibly do a little project
together in a greenhouse still the same
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse i've wanted to get for a while
from forever flowering greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: although we're going to be contacting a
bunch of different greenhouse companies
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's basically going to be the
show the show will be us building the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse the show will be ron planting
the greenhouse talking about all of his
[SPEAKER_00]: growing tips wake and bakes every morning
with ron in the greenhouse massive
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities of social media content for me
processing all of the resins afterwards
[SPEAKER_00]: into you know dry sift bubble hash and
rosin macro photographing the whole crop
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed to extracted resin heads massive
quantities of tips listen ron is very very
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable in the cannabis world very
very knowledgeable in growing and uh he
[SPEAKER_00]: will be able to have tips like you won't
believe and so and yes tricom city we are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for that kind of help i'll
probably grab a couple of interns through
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews gonna have to be able to trust
them but to be able to have them also come
[SPEAKER_00]: and do work under ron and myself um you
know whether it's helping with editing
[SPEAKER_00]: helping with filming helping with growing
helping with hash making uh helping with a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of different things like that
obviously people who are local are ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's an intern position we're not
looking to you know right away be paying
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the gate we're definitely not
looking to tell ask people to move from
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries and far away to come here
with the hopes that this will be a job
[SPEAKER_00]: that opens up their future and we don't
want that responsibility but a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: ships will be there for sure for people
who are local for people who live here who
[SPEAKER_00]: have their support system here and for
people we know aren't going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: bugger off back to home after three or
four weeks if things don't go proper
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble university yeah with ron and myself
i'm pretty excited about i'm not gonna lie
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm uh i'm really excited at the at the
idea of just having ron back in my life he
[SPEAKER_00]: lived so far away 10 10 hours away and i
know he could be a great grandfather
[SPEAKER_00]: figure to my kids and he is a great father
figure to me as well as a mentor and a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend so very excited at the whole idea
of ron coming out here so thought i would
[SPEAKER_00]: share that guy with you guys not too sure
when we're gonna try and make it happen
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in the next six months we're gonna
start doing research if you guys know
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse companies that might want to
you know forever flowering greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: came on hash church and i fell in love
with that greenhouse if they can give us a
[SPEAKER_00]: good deal we will definitely um you know
grab that greenhouse but this is you know
[SPEAKER_00]: we won't be growing cannabis for profit or
for sale we'll really be growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for the content and for the education
value and we're going to be promoting the
[SPEAKER_00]: company who uh sells us the greenhouse so
we really want to be able to get the most
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely awesome deal that we can
possibly get uh you know so if any of you
[SPEAKER_00]: out there know any companies greenhouse
companies definitely let me know hit me up
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll send out the email to them
because we're basically going to send out
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice cover email explaining bubble man's
world the wake and bake shows all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things and how we can start
doing it out of the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental lighting uh you know
obviously uh blackout you know the forever
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering greenhouse one of the main
things was that you could control the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering uh the photoperiod by simply
making it dark or keeping it light so all
[SPEAKER_00]: of that is really cool got me super
excited um and uh yeah hail the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: that's it finna what's going on finna 23
minutes 49 seconds yeah time lapse cameras
[SPEAKER_00]: in the greenhouse there you go exactly
leds and and you know gavitas and like the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole nine yards will will have a whole
variety of things going on in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: i'll definitely promise you this much it
will be uh heaven on earth yeah right on
[SPEAKER_00]: coup sorry that it's freezing up um i'm
gonna probably blaze off right now feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good beautiful day found out the
