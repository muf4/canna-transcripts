[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you been to Bub's party before?
[SPEAKER_11]: Never.
[SPEAKER_11]: I missed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright everybody, welcome to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with my good buddy Johnny B and
we are here at 56 Hope Road.
[SPEAKER_02]: His last house that he owned right there
at 56 Hope Road.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's now a museum.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here at the festivities where the
Nyabengi drummers are currently playing on
stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 8.48am.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just got some absolutely beautiful
food that we're about to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's loud, we understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Howard Mu Young.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my portfolio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, he's going to show us his
portfolio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Howard is a famous Jamaican photographer
who took some incredible photos at the One
[SPEAKER_02]: Love concert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, many amazing photos over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the years in Jamaica, but Howard was
definitely there for one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: historical, the One Love concert where of
course Bob joined the hands of Edward
[SPEAKER_02]: Siaga and Manly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, there it is right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been doing these cool different
prints of them which are just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really well priced.
[SPEAKER_02]: 18 year old Bob.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, okay I'm blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's drawing these from his paintings,
from his photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, you're a really talented dude man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me show you something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're getting a history lesson
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh nice, Militant Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is the big ones like Bob.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, that one's so like iconic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an iconic photograph.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the individual photographs
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't get, I can't load them up to
this size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See him there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: See?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He blew that one up right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so here's something.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the people that are watching,
where can they, because they're not here,
[SPEAKER_02]: where can they access this and purchase
this from you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an online site or a phone number?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well give us your email
address.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moonimages.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moonimages.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moonimages.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moonimages.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moonimages.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mou Young.
[SPEAKER_02]: Howard Mou Young.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when did you start taking these
photos?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what, 70?
[SPEAKER_02]: 1978.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 39 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm 43.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have been just getting out of
diapers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 74.
[SPEAKER_02]: 74, well you're looking good for 74.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also, I also have done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gunman on stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the original coaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, the original one, love?
[SPEAKER_02]: The original one, the coaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, amazing that you still have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and I have it, I have it,
I have it re-done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the original newspaper that it did.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's really impressive that you've
managed to you know, maintain this
[SPEAKER_02]: history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is great, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great images.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, these are really great, Howard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm a photographer as well,
but to be able to take your photography
[SPEAKER_02]: and then draw it like at this quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean they look like a computer did them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just talented beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of that, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're supporting Howard's
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all will.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get Tony and those guys over here
and checking it out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that I want right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, buy that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one, I think that's the one
that I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's perfect for you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, boom.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pulling out the cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks for walking us through this,
Howard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should come by our booth later and
we'll show you what we're up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Johnny just supported Howard
Mu and of course we'll be supporting him
[SPEAKER_02]: later on as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to head back to the CRD
booth on this Puff Wednesday and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually going to have our first puff of
our Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, let's show him where
we're going here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have been here since 6 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon's in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bongo Herman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, this is the OG drummer,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: The OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: For real.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fucking album is badass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those drums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what time Kittis is going to get
here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Should give him a call.
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drumming with the prince, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's Matt from Sasquatch,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be purchasing some albums
from Bongo Herman.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Jessica doing a little bag
shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're puffing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the trick to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I landed today at 420 is when I stepped
in.
[SPEAKER_11]: A.M.
[SPEAKER_11]: A.M.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wicked, wicked.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it already on?
[SPEAKER_14]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a while to convince the
steamers that I wasn't burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come along with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come along with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it all started here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The steam pipe started here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no other history before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I ever had the patience like in my
house, I'd love this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't ever have the patience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have it and it's sitting there,
what's neat about it is that you can
[SPEAKER_10]: access this in 30 seconds in your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure you can.
[SPEAKER_10]: Respect to the Dabas.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcel, I'm Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owned a raw food cafe in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 100% vegan, organic, and
macrobiotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I felt like if you're going to be
vegan, don't fly your food on jet
[SPEAKER_02]: airplanes from the other side of the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It defeats the purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you were saying after you took
the prana.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were talking the fact that a lot of
people don't know these are, when we talk
[SPEAKER_14]: about vegan, these are actually vegan.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's no alcohol.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no chemicals used in the entire
process.
[SPEAKER_14]: No animal.
[SPEAKER_14]: No animal.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no heat either.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a hypoallergenic drop.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you're dealing with C8 and C10,
we were talking about special blends of
[SPEAKER_14]: capric fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's different between coconut oils and
some teas.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you start looking at the C8,
C9, C10, C11, C12, you'll find different
[SPEAKER_14]: ratios with this.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this particular combination works
really well for those that are vegans that
[SPEAKER_14]: don't have any meat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because this particular combination is
going to absorb super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after you took it, he asked you if you
felt high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, no, I don't feel high.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just feel a burst of energy,
real natural energy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you feel good from it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got that going on, or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff Wednesday, and a little strawberry
banana turp dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberry banana turp dip?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to do some clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got about an ml of clementine right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dab on Puff Wednesday with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a Puff Wednesday puffy right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, this guy's being filmed by other
people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tony in the house.
[SPEAKER_12]: This guy's fishing in the Sasquatch thing
that's going on.
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't be the same if you didn't get the
coffin at the end, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's my turn, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_12]: See?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're educating people here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're talking more about turkey profile
and cannabis and how it helps everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at the crew.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody's quite interested.
[SPEAKER_12]: So here you guys go.
[SPEAKER_14]: So those that are in its raw form.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't give this to someone that never
dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would give them a much smaller dab and
let them build up to the bioassay of how
[SPEAKER_02]: they feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it can take you many little ones
to feel the way you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you take too big of one,
you're just uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like hitting a steamer for the first
time really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you lit it up, and you're just like,
so we're not really looking to do that to
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_10]: That turns people off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We give people the hits that they want to
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for my partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dip that in the Turks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how easy that was.
[SPEAKER_13]: It came right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: How the hell did they get that out?
Easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that, Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_02]: That replaced 30 pharmaceutical pills that
he used to be on.
[SPEAKER_02]: He broke his neck, broke his back,
shattered his arm, shattered his jaw,
[SPEAKER_02]: fell 30 feet off of a roof, and uses only
cannabis for his pain management now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how I had a neck surgery.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's kind of like, this is my medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what works for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's what I tell the world, how cannabis
helps me in all different conditions.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what it's all about,
is the education on how we can actually
[SPEAKER_12]: take the extraction, true plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like what Mark always says.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a good personal story.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_12]: And don't go so profound.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, wait a minute, time out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a little neck pain, but you broke
your back.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steamer's a bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Joe's going in for a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the compressor rocking in the
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: I bet it does.
[SPEAKER_13]: No matter why you hit it out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are going to see these plates
heat up faster than you've ever seen them
[SPEAKER_02]: heat up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_13]: The plates will heat up fast.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, because it's already hot out here.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, when it's like 120 in the shop
in a fucking place, they're just like 220
[SPEAKER_13]: in fucking 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be like today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Already burning your hand before you turn
this shit on.
[SPEAKER_14]: You hear that compressor?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it'll shut off after a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just letting you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were worried about pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting pressured.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going up to like 180 or
something?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking we're going to press around
200.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're pressing around 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: The compressor just went off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's off.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's setting the temperature gauge on each
plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do some like 140 for five
minutes pressing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Make a little bit of butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are about to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, we're about to squish some rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, get a front row seat for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiny little bit of bud inside the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll do 14 grams at a time,
or 50, you know, more.
[SPEAKER_13]: Put an ounce, easy ounce in here,
but I like to do less just to preserve
your appetite.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's your quality.
[SPEAKER_13]: The less you go, you kind of pull out more
quality, but it takes you a lot more time.
[SPEAKER_13]: So depending on how big of a farmer you
are is really depending on how much you're
[SPEAKER_13]: going to want to put in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I see people putting two,
three ounces, four ounces, a quarter
[SPEAKER_13]: pound, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the bud in the screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going to put the bud in the pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going to slide it into there and
squish it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to get the aura for one time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or do you want to make heavy production?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty neat to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it for drumming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really good respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bud goes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Foot pump goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's so nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little foot pump.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get it heated up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me explain some science here.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's essentially steeping out the oil
that's inside that bud.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that oil is getting pushed out by the
water.
[SPEAKER_14]: The oil and water don't mix.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, do you need a dabber to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the oil coming off the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's serious oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for that little bit of bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ital oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like 70% THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: That would make you high.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really high.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or it will heal you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or it will kill you.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is some Jamaican bud, actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some Jamaican bud mixed with one bud of
Cali.
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely some nice, resinous Jamaican
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's excitement in the air as we're
pressing rosin over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put some rosin on the steamer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to put some rosin on the steamer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hit it off the steamer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was trying to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I was trying to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to pull on it almost while
you're.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke it through the joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll still be sweet, trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what we're sharing with
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we give it all to one person,
then we'll get 20 more people high with
[SPEAKER_02]: that, easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have a hard time doing it
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is oil that we just squished out of.
[SPEAKER_14]: This should work pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to hold that for a second?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can't get that off here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have told you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need ice.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll back you up.
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to get an ice tank.
[SPEAKER_14]: What?
[SPEAKER_14]: Icing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, just oil came out real oily.
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ice, now.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have an ice over there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ice.
[SPEAKER_13]: To press down on it, we'll make oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll learn what we do now.
[SPEAKER_13]: But as you can see, we're going back where
we are.
[SPEAKER_13]: The hair straightener, like I was saying
originally.
[SPEAKER_13]: The flat iron straightener here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to have enough to make some
oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: The remnants you can give to people that
want to try it on joints, they can put a
[SPEAKER_02]: rolling paper on it and peel it off.
[SPEAKER_13]: You need an empty rolling paper to stick
it on and then peel it off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Straight from the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to be out of the booth for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_13]: Something you can do on a hair
straightener is to do a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_13]: On this press, you can put in an ounce or
two depending on your method.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of different methods that
are coming about.
[SPEAKER_13]: People are trading their own methods
daily.
[SPEAKER_13]: They call it a tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to even say.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they just do anything and put the name
tech at the end of it, it's theirs.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's basically it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a real fear and scar.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hard to even say what's best at this
point because it's still new and it's
[SPEAKER_13]: still something that's going to be
discovered every day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you seen this before?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think a few years into it, we'll have
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, we brought these guys out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a technology that they came up
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's heated plates.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to put that herb inside the
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to put it inside the
parchment, close down the press for about
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 to 30 seconds, and when you open it up,
there's going to be this incredibly clean
[SPEAKER_02]: oil that's steamed off the plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you hit that oil, it is so much
stronger than smoking herb by itself that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no sealing to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was explaining it to the other dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you're sitting up closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The herb is kind of like a middle,
back row thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys use your ears?
[SPEAKER_02]: I listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also listen for the steaming of the
resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially when you're pressing bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always press bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love when the resin starts coming
through the screen and that's when I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: giving pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do a little pre-press.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's using a foot pedal to push down the
20-ton jab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it weighs like 130 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was maybe a gram and a half.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's butter coming right out.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's humidity.
[SPEAKER_12]: No choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put a lot in, you'll just see it
dripping down, but they only put a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of grams of butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, it buttered out nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of textures that the
rosin will come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can come out real snap and pull and
really consistent like shatter,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it also does this sort of cake
batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minor blowout.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the moisture from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Smells incredible.
[SPEAKER_13]: From the air.
[SPEAKER_13]: I packed it way tight too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make an oil at Bob's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well done, boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so what do we got?
[SPEAKER_02]: Clementine and strawberry banana?
[SPEAKER_13]: Strawberry banana, good clementine.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Richie.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you put your hand there, you have to
pull.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just pull hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to wait until you can make a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pull harder.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, make a problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony,
[SPEAKER_12]: have you done one yet?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, I just did one.
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to get down on the diesel enough?
[SPEAKER_10]: We got pressure?
[SPEAKER_13]: We do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamaica, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got to switch plugs around here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we need the pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just recording.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think I recorded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your herbs dripping, Kittis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a full drip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Got a little more pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty good temperature for this oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it almost done, or are we going another
minute?
[SPEAKER_13]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Kittis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, put that up here if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Kittis wants to stick his nose in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, ho, ho.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right in the drip.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the dripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at Kittis's bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at Kittis's bud we just squished.
[SPEAKER_02]: That oil came off his bud.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no fucking solvent.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I've been trying to tell you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now imagine how well and crazy this
has to be broke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where am I from?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, where am I from, did you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first, 500 is the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a dab of it?
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to get this off, you put this
in.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you take it out of the freezer.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you take this little gap, you want it
to level into one spot.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I'm saying, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, sir, this is justice.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is justice straight out of SVG,
endorsing the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not no trouble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke the weed on the double man.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the top, I don't know, sir,
make up yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bare cannibal noise, THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we have promoted, safe for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight, straight, straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're just smoking, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could do the clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: No joking, marijuana, no smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make up yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Facebook fans and followers from
UK, all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: North America, South America, Africa,
the whole Caribbean, Jamaica, Barbados.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make up yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't forget, link up bubble man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I got to give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Justice, I met Justice online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a video of him on YouTube and
Facebook where he was singing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had his little kids in front of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had his flip going and he had this
inspirational, positive vibration and this
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of normalization of being able to use
cannabis safely around children that
[SPEAKER_02]: inspired me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just talking to him for the last 15,
20 minutes, I thought, I think this is
[SPEAKER_02]: justice I'm talking to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So man, respect, maximum respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one race, it's the human race.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're all a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the brain and to the heart of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I gave him a piece on paper already
because he thought, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm telling you, the first time I
saw this dude's video, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a kindred soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so amazing, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's singing, busting out all these
freestyles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like, next level positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his two little kids in front of
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got dreads, they're singing and
dancing and they look so happy and
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that herb cut up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get this drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell it was serious when the phones
came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What butt is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not our butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh good, see Kevin knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin's a full time steamer, he's not
joking around.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's committed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's jumped in with both feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's great about this machine is it's
the word of God when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: quality of your herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can think your herb is whatever you
want to think, but when it comes out and
[SPEAKER_02]: gives you 10, 15, 20% return and it's got
that color like caramel, I mean that's
[SPEAKER_02]: just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Joel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how hard I want to hit it,
but I think we did alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're killing it, bro,
like in a good way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, open her up on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was great, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, mild clean up and that's good,
that's nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, smells good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be going in that
chalice right here, over here in the very
[SPEAKER_02]: near future.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is going to be stable just
from looking at it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got to cool down to 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool it down to 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, dude, right on.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: he'll make it thicker.
[SPEAKER_10]: You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, we have started the process of
getting some licenses in place,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly for the medicinal development
of Ghana and for other juices as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to take a little time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has taken too long, but I'm certain
that within the coming months,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see some definitive
movements.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And would you try to get the machines here
as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, once we get the license,
the private developers would bring in all
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment that are covered under that
license.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a very blessed day.
[SPEAKER_14]: You drilled me with the camera and then he
showed up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to press some hash, boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's going to get a drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's going to get a drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, press some hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll rock it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to maybe make a,
we'll get it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can start working some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to see this squish.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to come around this side?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably going to have to to film it,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your footage will never end up on my
YouTube channel, but this one?
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the hash man?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to be seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's what I mean by a little
pre-squish right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Always, always preheat and then apply
pressure slowly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially when working with hash,
you're going to blow out bags if you just
[SPEAKER_13]: try to slam the pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a lighter brown color on the
left there.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're succeeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty trippy, eh?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's from Mr. Bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the hash man?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get up and see your own
product, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what we're able to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hashing the screen, pressure,
and the oil came right out, solventless
[SPEAKER_02]: oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's hash oil, not herb oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hash oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what hash oil is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be strong and thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the quality of the hash, sorry,
depends on, like, the resistance you've
got.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbite.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbite.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbite.
[SPEAKER_12]: Herbite.
[SPEAKER_12]: Herbite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I can hear you just passing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm ready to give up and wake up tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Straight.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a radio show at 9.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got dinner at 9.30.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some days are better than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, brother, they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting used to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleeping two hours a night?
Never.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who disrespects the artist?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think
[SPEAKER_10]: he's going to hit that, but sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, turp dip him.
Clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my darling.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'm going to keep him pure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to keep him pure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't see it anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got somebody else here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's the way she named it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I keep yawning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, dude, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Two hours wasn't enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: More.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just do the whole thing.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
