[SPEAKER_01]: Alright guys, just got here to the
Vancouver Seed Bank in CCHQ on the second
[SPEAKER_01]: floor off of Hastings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we might have a little session
going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some well known folks in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that snow, see it's even more
than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens is, is that, hello,
you're in a gray bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plain blue one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good thanks, you're so dark I can't even
see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is, it's Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Matt the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana man's in the house holding it
down as always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: McMahon's in the house holding it down
pretty much as always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we puffing on here Matt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our kidneys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the finger hash rosin that has
purposely been left out for over a week
[SPEAKER_04]: just to see what happens to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is the finger rub rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a little rosin with finger rub and
I was also very impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is like, it's piney, lemony.
[SPEAKER_01]: What strain did you say it was?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh okay, yeah, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has like the mad piney.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, I mean I'm still saying it as a
very serious thing that this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: closest reminder I've seen of Romulan
Joe's Romulan since back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say that's going back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I don't see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it when he puts it in a container
and he closes the container for like a day
[SPEAKER_01]: and you open it, that smell to me is Joe's
old Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I miss it, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check it out in the GG1,
the Afghani 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Enrico was explaining to me the
importance of keeping this down and not
[SPEAKER_01]: letting it cool even for like a couple of
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it for that aspect because you can
turn this unit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, and hold it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can dab and I can put weed
underneath because it's not so hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This little fucking lid keeps that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be hard to carve that thing any
other way and he was saying that this
[SPEAKER_01]: makes up like a certain percentage of the
mass that is heating up the atomizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're just leaving it up like
this for a minute or two, it can take away
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of like, I don't know how to put
it into words any other way than the
[SPEAKER_01]: sublimator accesses magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has this little point where it's
like, I can't get that anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have one of these?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is close to the best app I've ever
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd say so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still use my D-nail for dabbing resins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love the atomizer pudding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever tried putting that in the
atomizer as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that also hits a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the atomizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole bowl is the atomizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the things with the
sublimator that the wand itself is really
[SPEAKER_01]: only heating the atomizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if you're dabbing off of
it, but for herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you take this whole unit off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you just lift this whole thing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'd lay like a bed of weed or
you could even just take hash and drop it
[SPEAKER_01]: right in there and hit it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just drop it right in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never dabbed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've played around a lot with the
sublimator when I first got it and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just amazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the heating unit though,
right?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it heats this up like hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what I usually do is I would put like
a larger chunk of hash, roll it into a
[SPEAKER_04]: ball or something, and then put it in and
then put this on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, drop it right on top of the screen
or onto a little bit of herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd be here all day figuring out how to
drop that in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just dab it on the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm down for another little dabbing tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a real nice tight screen in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great gardener's doing the up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great gardener, Dabs.
Dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just leaves nothing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing and then you look back at
the spoon when you're done and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: always at least a little clear dome on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just liquefies on the ... I made it
with finger high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got that rongolin flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lemon-y pine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Mr. Clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like inhaling a Mr. Clean bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like somebody's washed the walls
with pine salt and you've walked into the
[SPEAKER_03]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got you on the menu here,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here, the one that's all sold out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hot, all sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good prices on those too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can't ... It's hard to keep them
in stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he doesn't bring them to me and then
... What?
[SPEAKER_04]: I bring them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bring them and they're sold out in so
many days.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love selling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to grow more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always here at the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come see these guys if you're in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a couple of options that you
can come and check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two just on Hastings, but I think this
one's the fun one, personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Marijuana Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come play as a bull with them and buy some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, he won't be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be super fluky if you hit Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get here and Matt is here,
he's going to dab you up too, but he's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going riding.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you in a bit.
See you in a bit.
