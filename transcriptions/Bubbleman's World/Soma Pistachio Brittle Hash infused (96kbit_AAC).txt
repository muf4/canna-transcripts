[SPEAKER_01]: We're rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got organic coconut oil and a little
bit of organic butter in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm taking these organic
pistachio nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm taking this Murray River salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks like the Himalayan rock salt,
but it's river salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it better than the Himalayan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I should probably mention that I'm here
at Soma's and what he's doing is he's
[SPEAKER_02]: producing some of his unbelievable,
I guess it would be called not almond
[SPEAKER_01]: roca, but... It would be peanut brittle
but pistachio brittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pistachio brittle or pistachio roca and
it's unbelievable caramel that he
[SPEAKER_02]: medicates up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Spain they call it cosmic candy,
Soma's cosmic candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Spain I call it about a three hour
siesta.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Amsterdam I call it almost didn't get
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things it does, it's like food
incense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely obvious that you're using
high quality concentrates to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's really not a ganja taste
but like a turpentine taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean like I'm using like my
favorite things to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hashes and concentrates basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long you been making this stuff for
Soma?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's like seeing as I use cannabis
as medicine, I discovered when I got with
[SPEAKER_01]: Jessie, she was eating space cake a lot
and I go, how do you eat space cake so
[SPEAKER_01]: often, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, when I eat Dave's candy or
something, I go... Those are insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, I can't function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are non-functionable candies though.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can do that stuff way better now
because I eat hash three times a week at
[SPEAKER_01]: least.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least sometimes once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean like it makes me feel so good
eating hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It relaxes my body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me sleep better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me produce more melatonin,
I swear to God.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the older dudes I've been talking
to out here, they're out there having some
[SPEAKER_02]: health ramifications and every single one
of them I asked, are you consuming
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, yeah, I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, but you know you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you gotta eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to eat it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to smoke it but you gotta eat it
too, especially if you need it for
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking it's great to feed the soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right there I got the pistachio nuts
roasted a little bit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna put those aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll do the next step in a
couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we hit the next step, I think we
should hit a nice bowl of Tony V's Tert
[SPEAKER_02]: Melts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out the mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step two.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm gonna tell everyone to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Adam gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used it in my court case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in there, cause they busted me with
14.3 kilos here in 2004.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a stash in the walls of the roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had 11 plants up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're so dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, look, I grew all that on my roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go, how can you grow that much in
your life?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had expert witnesses come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the bailiff.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I walked into the court, he says,
you can't bring that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, you're gonna hit the judge
with that, Woody?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they took it from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I finally got to speak,
they gave it back to me so I could speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said to the expert witness,
who was James Burton, who grew all the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed for the Dutch government.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the beginning, legalizing medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Mr. Burton, how much can you grow
on a plant like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said about two kilos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had 11 plants on my roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, Dave probably pulled more
next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we got three kinds of full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get that into the light right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is, right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This cacao butter, cow butter,
and organic coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All organic.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much did you use, just like a
little dollop of each sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did you measure that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, five grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five grams of the hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what about the coconut?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't measure that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it by eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been doing it long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all the time I've been cooking and
when I had my bakery, I always do
[SPEAKER_01]: everything by eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for measuring the hash because I
want to know exactly how much I get in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, now I don't want it to burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I get it melted like that,
first goes in organic raw sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that why that stuff's so good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's just like sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at homeopathic medicine,
it's almost always in your sugar carrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so then after that, I got
[SPEAKER_01]: this lemon organic vanilla syrup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Madagascar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that goes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also just a sort of guesstimation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this organic maple syrup from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, the Canadian maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That got things rocking, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then more of the salt?
[SPEAKER_01]: I should load more of the Murray River sea
salt because I find that the salt also
[SPEAKER_01]: activates the hash going into your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just the fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the salt will also sort of react
the opposite of the sweetness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just amazing how when you use sugar
as a carrier like this, I think it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: best way you could think of using it as a
medicine carrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see why all the homeopathic
medicines are all on a sugar base because
[SPEAKER_01]: they figured out that it goes into your
system really easy with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find the same thing with this hash
candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this turn into a liquid eventually?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to caramelize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a little bit, I'll add the nuts back
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't want the nuts to get too
cooked, so I just wait a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that five grams of hash totally gets
absorbed by this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the most homogenous way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about too much of
it going one spot because I've done it
[SPEAKER_01]: many times, and it really works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see any spot where there's a
concentration of too much hash because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's thinned out in the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more it melts, the more it
homogenizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you didn't even have to filter out any
of the hash chunks that were left over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just will dissipate.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because it's full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find full melt hash mixes with fats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hug each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bond, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sure like each other, don't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff has to get hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it on the highest heat,
and it takes maybe about five minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: before it actually gets hot enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it reaches that temperature,
it goes fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it liquidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can see it starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want it to burn too,
so you got to heat it and cool it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this full melt hash, the whole thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a Legend's entry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is Soma's.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's put 300 grams of full melt hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sending this to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Soma full melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look how fucking crystalline that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those heavies are.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you call sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's real sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight food to sister hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's loosening up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, now turn the heat up again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking care of business while making
Soma's finest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's taking care of business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell like I got into a turp patch,
didn't I?
[SPEAKER_02]: You do smell a little bit like you got
into the turp patch.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you smell like that, I call you
Turpian Twin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: As fast as I get weed right now,
it's out the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't hardly get it fast enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally never made caramels or almond
rocas, but I have gotten into the feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: of my endocannabinoid system via a coconut
oil infused.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use dry sift and sometimes hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm amazed how small of an amount
of this I need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get a nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm a full-time smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I eat this, it's amazing how
small amount I eat, and it does what I
[SPEAKER_01]: want it to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many grams did you put in again?
[SPEAKER_01]: 5 grams I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: 5 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do about 4.
[SPEAKER_02]: 4 grams per cup of coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think this might even be a higher
dilution in the sense that it's much more
[SPEAKER_01]: than a cup.
It is a higher dilution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm telling you, somehow this
combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't have to tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the eugenol in the vanilla.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have something to do with the synergy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely something going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different than the coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an unbelievable tool for insomnia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the insomnia.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about fibromyalgia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you don't have fibromyalgia when you
eat this candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm putting the pistachios back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which you don't have memory or pains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have sleep problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're definitely going to the
bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine that this delicious treat can
regulate your biological functions through
[SPEAKER_01]: your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got four fats.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the fat from the pistachios.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the fat from the coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the fat from the cacao butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fat from the cow butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find that with four fats like that,
it goes in your system better than if you
[SPEAKER_01]: just use coconut oil or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just use butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Multi-fat tactic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this will eventually just turn to
liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it goes slow at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it just,
it's like overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is almost like waiting to watch full
melt melt in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm literally excited waiting for Soma's
concoction here to melt into a Caramelli
[SPEAKER_02]: almond rocai peanut brittle-y goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's close too because it's doing it on
the edge of the pan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will ghost up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasty treats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one great way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you have a variety of ways that
you consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuesday I'm going to make a pina colada
smoothie at my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's a really nice way too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've seen you do that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that maybe at the... I find that
at the cannabis cups it's a nice way to
[SPEAKER_01]: share some.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody gets such a little taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only taste in it really.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend used to do it at like Grateful
Dead shows and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought like a 10-speed bicycle that he
took apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he set up the chain on the back wheel
so it went to a blender.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was blender... Sounds like a friend
I used to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name was B-Rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He owned a hemp store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a guy named Michael that did
something like that with a juicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a similar thing but a blender.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would make a, you know,
pedal blender.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would blend his drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pedal power.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could even make your own juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he wouldn't pedal them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say in the next three minutes it's
going to flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sure a nice color right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to bubble on the edges.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get this into a liquid state and
then I guess pour it out on a pan or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using this silicone spatula.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we should do day one and when
we arrive is come make a batch of this
[SPEAKER_02]: with Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have this in our... Hey meow
meow boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that rescue remedy?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just not a little boy if you don't
have a story about jumping on the bed and
[SPEAKER_02]: then hitting the dresser with the corner
of your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sang five little monkeys jumping on
the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: One fell off and bumped his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mama called the doctor and the doctor
said, no more monkeys jumping on the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just singing that to him and he
reacted pretty good and made me not worry
[SPEAKER_01]: so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, he's got an egg on his head though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the worst to see little children with
pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could tape it instead of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, from a distance now this almost looks
like some epic curry that you're mixing
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about hash curry?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashish curry, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think with hashish generally
would be nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend who's dying in a... Well he was in
the hospital now he's out but he's dying
[SPEAKER_01]: from prostate cancer and his wife started
coming over and getting his candy from me
[SPEAKER_01]: and it helps him so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could help him all the way but it
definitely helps him have an appetite and
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep and be more comfortable.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a nice consistency now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is so hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this pan that I'm gonna pour it
into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: This covers that pan no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that outside or in the fridge?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you just leave it cool out on the
counter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I let it cool right here and since a lot
of times I like to eat the pieces without
[SPEAKER_01]: the nuts because I want teeth so I prop it
up a little bit just so that one part is
[SPEAKER_01]: more nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One part is more nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes about an hour to cool all the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this part on here cools a little bit
faster and people like Marcel usually
[SPEAKER_01]: taste it off of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we show the finished product in the
freezer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like all cooking shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe have a huge chunk for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever watch Julia's child,
if she didn't just make something,
[SPEAKER_01]: she had the finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the roast beef dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will end up looking like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast reactions from being stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was damn quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peanut, brittle, pistachio.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the pistachio nuts in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like a piece?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love a piece.
Yummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well thank you for sharing that with us
Soma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the people will enjoy that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is the YouTube channel they can
check you guys out at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma Mission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soma Mission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put the link in the comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to see more cool shit like
this, come check out Soma Mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just broke off your nutless area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that like, it's good glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The texture is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sound of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: One big piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is still warm a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's real thick down over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stop.
