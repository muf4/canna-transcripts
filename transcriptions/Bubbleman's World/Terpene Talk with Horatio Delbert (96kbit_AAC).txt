[SPEAKER_03]: Well, welcome to Bubble Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble Man here with my good buddy Horatio
in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to talk about today?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about an interesting
little... Yeah, we're going to... I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Hash Church where me and Tony and
Kay from Tri-Technologies got into
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes to a high degree, Kenny kind of
isolated that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thrust was to get at that 90% of
what's lost during the drying process
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's what we don't experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the most volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know them from smelling frozen sift
that's just off gassing and I kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: already knew that if there's only so many
ways we can get back to the plant in its
[SPEAKER_01]: full essence and we've seen the trend of
live resin and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen live sift pop up here and
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty unstable, but it's happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always look at sustainable methods to
recreate that end without the downside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we're going to be looking at
some pecs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw that on our Mega Chill episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the Pineapple Express?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pecs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pecs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the pecs wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been crushed all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's never been dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you get the raw, raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can kind of see... I mean,
it's been going... You know, I can
[SPEAKER_03]: literally remember being like maybe even
before high school and buying herb like
[SPEAKER_03]: this and thinking... This is the shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at how crazy this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you smell this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you smell it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but like feel it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel how it's like spongy like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to roll so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my buddy's like, yeah,
it's like...
[SPEAKER_03]: 80% water, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is wet weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we've got the wet sample,
which is a nice kind of... In my opinion,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a great way if you're going to go
through a series what he has is fresh,
[SPEAKER_03]: dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's check out dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I got to package this up
because this is still off gassing like
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy and taking the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of when you smell that,
what's cured versus what's lost?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can definitely smell the smell much
stronger in this that is in that but is
[SPEAKER_03]: being masked by all that water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just being held back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder if that's because the turps
are preserved in the fresh herb completely
[SPEAKER_03]: and you would need to, you know,
release some of that water in order for
[SPEAKER_03]: some of those terpenes to volatize and
evaporate away before you were released
[SPEAKER_03]: with that properly cured, properly dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do have a piece of bud up my nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how that happened,
but my eyes are watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my eyes are watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like the confusing part about
smelling this is because it's wet,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't tell the water from the
volatiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not until you smell that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you smell this and then go back to
this, I think you're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: smell those because this is that smell
without the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's those volatiles without the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many are gone from there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I got to the point where I'm
like, okay, there's many ways to isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's whole terpene packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because my developmental aim was on
that isolate, knowing this came from this
[SPEAKER_01]: means I know the turps that I have are
only what I would lose because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: still representing good bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What medicinal aspects are present in,
because I split the water from those
[SPEAKER_01]: turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these super turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do these turps in hands are high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just the percentage of these same
turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a lab to test them and find out
the names of these turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, even just being able to test
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like Kay suggested they were the
sesquiterpinoids that were the most
[SPEAKER_03]: volatile super terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, now, okay, so for instance,
we've got the dry and we know this pex is
[SPEAKER_01]: made from dry material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't try any life-sick technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think dry sifting is not a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're dry sifting, you should dry
and then sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you try to turn this into a frozen rock
and then quickly try to pulverize it,
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate the heads all throughout the
process, every bit of head, every,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I got to make a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that dry ice process, all of the
contaminant are all, I got a second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just gets mashed into a wet sugary
paste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like when debris hits dry heads,
hard heads, brittle heads that in that
[SPEAKER_01]: balance, you essentially make a smear
patty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've tried to keep it cold and cold
and cold and sift it and then try to dry
[SPEAKER_01]: those remaining heads, but it's always
been a polka dot kaleidoscope of pasties
[SPEAKER_03]: that are essentially because it dries
perfect on the diluted, the dilution that
[SPEAKER_03]: it occurs on naturally on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it dries the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's kind of why, I mean,
we don't know where this has been a last
[SPEAKER_01]: preservative wise, but being able to do
this process correctly versus reaching out
[SPEAKER_01]: to methods that aren't appropriate and
then being able to reintroduce it back,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's more of an ultimate experience than
to try to process wet material
[SPEAKER_01]: unnaturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have a piece of butt on your nose
tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, I was just noticing the
sift just is the perfect example of the
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor of that butt, but now instead of
the water smell missing, like the way this
[SPEAKER_03]: smelled from this, you have that
chlorophyll plant matter, hay smell
[SPEAKER_03]: missing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even really notice when you
first smell this, just smells like nice
[SPEAKER_03]: butt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you smell this and you're like,
oh, that was nice butt with the smell of
[SPEAKER_03]: hay and plant matter and chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of to process your sift with
that, even just the juices from that
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll present are going to be
altering and bathing your sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can dry it, but... That's why it's
called dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people are stoked on
trying to do dry ice and then clean it
[SPEAKER_03]: from there, but the problem is not that
the dry ice is making the hash wet,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's that the hash is wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never been properly dried and they
don't think that it's wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get a result, but that result
changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: These particles aren't supposed to be at
this micron size, but they're stuck here
[SPEAKER_01]: because they came on trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're trying to dry them all in this
weird clump in a way that they'd never
[SPEAKER_03]: occur in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you imagine if you were trying to
design a perfect way to dry trichome
[SPEAKER_03]: heads?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that picture on the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that what you would design?
[SPEAKER_01]: The elaborated space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just every bunch of nail heads and then
you just balance them all on each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is it's only nature that could
do the subdivisional spacing so perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly I'm somebody who has the power to
choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done the wet material, I've looked at
the result, and by the time I dry it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the same terpene profile because
it's dry, but with a whole bunch of shit
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality changes and it can never...
Nothing can change the fact that the
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants were pasted into the heads
wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all nice stickers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're trying and playing around with
dry sift, try with the driest material
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good foundation to get you on the
way to discovering new and great things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're mucking around with wet heads,
not to say don't do that because maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: someone that's the game they want to play
or whatnot and they might have a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: discovery, but true I believe dry sifting
is not a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an accurate description for what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when... Because I remember,
live sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I got to try?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear if I can do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this is neat, but this isn't
practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually impractical and now I'm
going to have to bullshit my product
[SPEAKER_01]: because somebody who just puts in the
harder work is going to get a better
[SPEAKER_01]: result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm in a position now where I can get
the best of both worlds, but I'm also
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking to the fact I dried this to get
this and what I isolate from this,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to work out ways to
reincorporate that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be interesting to see how that
affects whiteout because of the direct
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction of terpenes to the outside of
the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't mind doing some time lapse
trials where we just see that macro and
[SPEAKER_01]: see if it breaks down, how it breaks down,
does it dilute?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it become a shatter?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an option that pure chlorophyll-free
heads gives us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm about ready to dip into these
unadulterated pure chlorophyll-free heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looks so darn nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean my dab real nice before I put it in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't have much grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't from your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You going to hit some of the packs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the coming weeks, that's what I'm
really excited about is developing a
[SPEAKER_01]: technique to reintroduce the undryable
aspects of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always searching for the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: The messenger seems to always be changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every new test says something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You almost threw away a cannabinoid that
you didn't know existed and this is now
[SPEAKER_01]: your chance to redevelop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why all these cannabinoids with the
abbreviation of V seem to be so exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: because we keep finding new secondary
THCV, CBDV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty excited to see how are these
precursor terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they simpler?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they feel so wet?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very exciting to learn more and more
about the profiles as we categorize and
[SPEAKER_03]: name all these unknown terpenes and
unknown cannabinoids for that matter and
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps even a whole new underlining
molecule for all we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll just be interesting as the science
goes deeper into it and we have younger
[SPEAKER_03]: people up and coming and going to school
for these specific subjects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited to see what countries
jump on board and what universities get on
[SPEAKER_03]: board for offering courses in agriculture
and botany and chemistry, specifically of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I hear these terpene names,
just because I focused so long on herbs
[SPEAKER_01]: that were medicinal and other types of
derivatives, I'm like, I know that name,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what it does, I just have to go
back to my book and then I get a whole new
[SPEAKER_01]: picture of what this cannabis plant's
message might be based on those terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when we know that science of really
discovering every name to everything is
[SPEAKER_01]: always a perpetual Rubik's Cube spot,
even just going through a name of 30 of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most dominant and then matching it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let alone 160 to 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, it's not just a guess,
this is the smell of pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you I could make an aromatheric
product that would, without the weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: even just looking at, again, that isolate,
without destroying my medicine in the bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking something we've never known,
could people be getting a benefit from
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever Pineapple Express offers in just
its light terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if it modulates cannabinoids,
what else does it modulate is the
[SPEAKER_03]: question, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Could it modulate mood?
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe, of course, it can modulate
mood.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the entire aromatherapy industry is
based on the modulation of mood through
[SPEAKER_03]: the inhalation of essential oil vapors
through different... Well, what you find
[SPEAKER_01]: is all kinds of plants have found,
without legs, have found their way all
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world just because the terpene
profile they put out controls human
[SPEAKER_01]: beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It controls their noses, it controls their
memories, it's imprinted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell goes as far back with us as sight.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know these plants didn't get around
the planet and don't persist, even when we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to bulldoze, without the power of
those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roses we don't eat, but there's a massive
industry off of those light terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on our desire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terpenes are part of human desire.
[SPEAKER_03]: To want those smells and flavors and
tastes is a simple desire of humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you read Michael Pollan's The
Botany of Desire, that book really breaks
[SPEAKER_03]: it down in a beautiful way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost in a way that nothing would happen
if it weren't for human desire.
[SPEAKER_03]: It literally fires everything that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I finally isolated this and I'm like,
is this what the growers are living with?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they recognize weed when they live
in such a pungent, aromatically rich
[SPEAKER_01]: environment?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Greek gardener's place is
unbelievable how stinky it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure he's numb.
[SPEAKER_03]: He must be numb to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that he still smells it,
but he's definitely slightly numb to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you also have some limonene oil there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got some pineapple espresso.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to check that out as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out all these different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys know I'm not into the oils,
but Horatio uses a terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's literally making oil with a
terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: A terpene that he produces on his own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cleans to a degree that makes this
really beautiful, nice product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when you smell that, do you feel
you smell the dry weed or the wet weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean that has a bit of a funk from
being in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a long day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a couple of hours since we did
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, let's get it out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll smell the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want that crush for science?
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's juicy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cut it a little closer to the fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the dry has it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has textures of both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has the terpenes reintroduced of that
wet experience, but with that dry note.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's either the lighter
component, like the citrusy smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the one you taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got an interesting texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every strain is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you notice, I can only imagine
how wet the terpenes from that train wreck
[SPEAKER_01]: we tried would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would pretty much be a little of a
liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty much auto-whiteout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even that train wreck, I'm like,
if I had terse back to this, this thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: a goner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to go out in the
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that's the wet... That seems pretty
stable though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, every strain is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every strain is different for stability.
[SPEAKER_03]: This train wreck having more... It's gooey
in the sense that it's not hard and
[SPEAKER_03]: shattery.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bendable and malleable,
but it definitely isn't dripping down the
[SPEAKER_03]: parchment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everybody knows the limiting process
removes all the lipids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the current myth goes, lipids
create the structure for shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something I believe, but my
product's always been a softer degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I won't smoke those lipids.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do a non-polar extract,
you've got to eliminate those polar
[SPEAKER_01]: components.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the wax lipids from something
like Sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's plant waxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're a whole different beast at a
way higher concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still haven't had this thing on in so
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like I want to take a vapor
out of some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dry herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always thought something was going to
reach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I know Greg Gardner was
talking about what if I could get to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen bubble in my walk-in freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have the ultimate experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to a degree, except for we can't
leave the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is he saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember he was saying basically to know
the strain to its full degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I... I think it was sifted or dew
bubble in a walk-in freezer and be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it was just make the bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cure it out frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it essentially never lost those
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except, yeah, you can't leave the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm hoping that there'll be a process
for the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the LHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not getting the turps from another
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The turps come literally from this dry
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bud smelled good when I broke it up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know the bud wasn't raked for
turps or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's getting this up to 420 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: My little... I guess they call it the herb
titan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trippy Sticks calls it the herbal unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I'm going to call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their version of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a... A few companies have a
similar design.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so far so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say it works pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like it's heating up fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that super medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost... What's the word?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like eucalyptic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it's eugenal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like more... Is it more like clove or more
like... Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell me what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost like lime rinds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty lemony.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting... Like almost so lemony that
you have to lick your lips to even taste
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it comes in like antiseptic.
[SPEAKER_03]: This actually hits pretty fucking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's getting... That's pretty
fucking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a turp rip, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real fucking... No, because I
usually have to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually tasted really fucking...
Huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now this becomes my next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the drying process that I'm using to
get to bone dry preserving more turps even
[SPEAKER_01]: in that product while I've stolen turps
from it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, is this what you call bone dry?
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point?
[SPEAKER_03]: It could get much bone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it could get a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is about 4%.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a little higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I only guessed that from this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how... Here's the thing about that,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hits that we got... I don't want to
grind it up over the shadow, but I feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like grinding up a bit in my finger to
feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That taste, though, is... There's a little
bit of water in there, which is key to get
[SPEAKER_03]: that turpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you bone it out, you'll get these
deeper, smokier vapor rips, but you won't
[SPEAKER_01]: get the vapor... No, it's the thing is I'm
actually... Because the thing is when you
[SPEAKER_01]: meter it, you get it at about 3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm thinking where I've kept this
bud since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it does feel... This doesn't feel
ready to sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I ask my fingers... I think it's
probably close to like 6% to 10%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just from the way it's like when I broke
it up and stuffed it in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because this is still in that
smoking range.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you could roll a joint and someone
would be quite pleased, like Remo,
[SPEAKER_03]: who smokes lots of joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he would tell you that
that's too dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas for me, when I get ready for it to
sift something... No, that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I didn't sift this with this
particular... I pulled this for the dry
[SPEAKER_01]: bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, yeah, there was dry for smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to see if it was an actually good
smokeable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's this handful, because I didn't
think I had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that, and I found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense, because it doesn't feel
sift ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still getting... It comes still patty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty excited about this as a drying
technique for the smoke as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where it stands when it comes
to preservatives compared to the different
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms people use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as an actual industrial process... So
we hit the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now everyone's wondering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is bubble man going to hit that oil?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it oil?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't vaporize a ton, but when I do,
I get neurotic about... I just go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: being the smoker me that just collected
ash for a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, why am I collecting this
vaporized nonsense?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just something that tells you
you're going to smoke it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, don't waste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could make coconut butters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coconut butters.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're serious about vaping,
there are medicinal aspects that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: extract into coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone saving a mountain of vaporized
trash, I don't want you chucking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's give this LHO a shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have it at a good temperature?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think I should turn it down?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would kindly, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the LHO guy, so... I'm not... Now,
this is quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: What temperature would you like it at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just drop it to 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as low as that 350 stuff I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that only works on titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's needed for quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go down to 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could always waste it to taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the end of the world if you can't
finish like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I could use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduce what back into the sift?
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduce the wet turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much the way to call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wet turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've never been... All my hash came
pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mystery pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's the new culture of the powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we run around with the powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel fairly a big part of that
because I always told people, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like... You can see what you
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have anything to hide,
then leave it in powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason you need to press it...
Well, there was two reasons originally why
[SPEAKER_03]: we pressed hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was to adulterate, to raise the
weights with non-glandular material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to smuggle.
[SPEAKER_03]: To move that product over borders and
across into international zones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't really need either of those
things in my opinion now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's just a matter of...
Because I keep... I'm figuring all my
[SPEAKER_01]: product with that much... Basically with
this amount of unstable terpenes in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is going to grease into a new
consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're not sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Flapping it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm hitting them.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of my buddy's LHO.
[SPEAKER_03]: No solvents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no chemical solvents like BHO.
[SPEAKER_03]: No hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Used in the extraction process,
so... Well, we better have a little rip
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrap temperature.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's very smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, I didn't take a monster rip,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: You took good... That's not my size,
Daps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That unique... Everyone has that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it so smooth?
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the lipids out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't take those lipids out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets rougher and rougher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's many views of what removing
lipids are, and I've always been in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim Farrah camp, and winterizing is a
completely different process than
[SPEAKER_01]: de-waxing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemonine is not even something you can
freeze and chill down and try to get waxes
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a butane-only phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go into terpene isolation,
if you go into the molecule world of
[SPEAKER_01]: essential oil extracts, it's a natural
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 extracts tons of lipids, and they have
to use a secondary solvent to remove it,
[SPEAKER_01]: or it can be just as harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they using?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to use a form of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: One way or another, you need a polar to
push it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't use some form of polar,
you're going to get caught... Through one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those discs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by polarity, you literally
push the fat... If you don't push fat out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the polar, and you just try to separate
it with temperature, you don't get a
[SPEAKER_01]: complete job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a full profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a partial profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe one day we'll be over at
Horatio's, and we'll end up showing you
[SPEAKER_03]: all this madness that he does in his
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_03]: One day, you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon enough, we're always working on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally possible, but you should hit
one of these LHOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit the SIFT.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit the BUD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit the LHO.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a PEX.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish there was a way to hit a wet BUD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way to vape... There is.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a sublimator, you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can literally put that BUD into the
sublimator, all turns off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it work in a volcano?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I asked people who tried to vaporize
wet weed, they said they didn't like the
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, of course, it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always wondered, would my water turn
green after extracting the turf,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a stupid concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because I pulled that water clean,
you tried that water on that last video,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's unique in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm developing a lotion out of it that
hopefully, maybe we have to demo by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time my laboratory is ready for the
public.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I didn't take much more than that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I had before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you said that I took a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked big to me, because these dabbers
are huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big hit, is all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to choke out where you probably
won't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's a contest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm choking out on my own shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell everyone Horatio was so wasted
on his own shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: First we hit the sift, then we hit the
BUD, although you only really got one
[SPEAKER_03]: taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free if you feel the urge to take
more rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that product in the stores yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have now got a collection of itty
bitty baggies like this, but I don't enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'll just roll one up since I'm
watching Dr. Green thumb, and then I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like, two hits, I don't know what to do
with this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just in the mood, but I like that
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remo must puff that in like three minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just be puffed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Poof.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, Remo, you are a fiend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got probably the best bait
taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much is what?
[SPEAKER_03]: These in stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: These what?
[SPEAKER_03]: These.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I want these.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 bucks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're 100 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you can get a better price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I have so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I don't really want this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it, and once again, I was like,
I don't think I need this thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I stuffed it, and I used it once,
and I was like, well, this thing's pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, all the BUD that people
have been giving me over the last six
[SPEAKER_03]: months that I've been stashed,
I started taking it out, started enjoying
[SPEAKER_03]: it, and I thought, man, I'll tell you,
if that thing can offer that to me,
I'm sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do I load it up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do this again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take the top off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dump the herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dump the herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just break some herbs,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that over there, end of the tib.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll clean this a little bit for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one, there's a screen right there on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The piece that screws on, which I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: This piece also screws off, so you can
clean the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I noticed the ones that
drove me crazy were the ones where I
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't reload it while I was walking to
the transit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well that's definitely a reload
while you're walking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it's got the, just grind me
up above.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I'm stuffing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I am happy with how that dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never, basically I forgot I had that,
so I'm only really smelling it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, it pops on easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Push the big oval button five times.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two, three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it turn on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, hold it down for four seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it'll go up to 420 degrees,
which I've been finding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing 380 and it was just too light.
[SPEAKER_03]: 420 seems to be the perfect temperature to
actually get it to a point where you get
[SPEAKER_03]: that perfect vapor rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not burnt by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was, I didn't expect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I expected the herbal hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't expect a turpentine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty good little unit,
I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trippy sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also sent me these, which are
awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent me like a bunch of Trippy wipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
And alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, you know, these, full.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like three or four of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Amelio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Horatio, Amelio.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys with your wild names.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got the classical biblical name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all on our mothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would start hitting it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right around 400 is where, yeah,
you get like 390 to 420 is just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get this really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have to push the button?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Push the button.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you'll already be getting some tasty
rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just those light antiseptic terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when I said the alcohol?
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that alcohol fraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's where this part of the
hit went.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of it, when I take the hit,
I think like you could clean up a hospital
[SPEAKER_03]: room with this smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how's that a way to antiseptic a
whole room?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you just have this crazy intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just basically put the, put the turkey on
the atomizer and fog it out.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming up with good ideas here all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this reminds me most of the alcohol
portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The portion that was the whitest and the
most yikes and.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have my solo here from a riser,
which a riser, which was a unit that I
[SPEAKER_03]: used for the longest time, but you can
tell between these two units.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got that pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this, this is just too damn
convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more the home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for home.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason why I'm vaporizing is to
quality control and assay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the fact that this is in glass,
but yet this does not hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's in a metal container.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and someone else told me that like,
Oh, that thing has a rubber thing and it
[SPEAKER_03]: tastes super bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I don't taste it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm pretty OCD and I'm not going to
lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I play, taste plastic or I taste
something I don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not why I'm looking at the
construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, why do I think it's made out of
one thing, but it behaves like another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because look, the red is one thing,
but look inside, see this black here and
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole heating chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this piece probably pulls right out,
probably goes to like here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is made out of the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: My vaporizer mouthpiece is made out of why
I don't get burnt in the mouth pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty good unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I can't say enough about it so
far.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been really travel friendly and it's
worked every time I've needed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing I really like about it is it
just, it doesn't just die super fast,
[SPEAKER_03]: which that drives me fucking nuts with
some of these units.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you hit the button three times
and all of a sudden it's blinking cause
[SPEAKER_03]: it's dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where Apex really came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy Christ with the five day,
this is a five day battery from Apex.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they basically, they put the real
batteries in the units.
[SPEAKER_03]: They use what I use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bird did it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He really took the pen to the next level
and created the Apex pen in my mind is not
[SPEAKER_03]: like a vapor pen of any sort.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like a comparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the battery power to feed the
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the same reason why the sublimator
is borderline dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it creates such a borderline smoking
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could do something like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you just push this button and you
can take these crazy insane rips through
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another little fun toy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many fun toys to try out here,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an awesome little taster test there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, next time we're sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did forget the little terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were going to smell the terpenes as
well as the fresh bud, the wet bud,
[SPEAKER_03]: the dry sift, the L H O.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can honestly say this as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I definitely smelled the slightest
orange in this, but it's by far the least
[SPEAKER_03]: I've ever smelled in any product that you
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't really overwhelm me in the
taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: It still tasted substantially like this,
but I just finished smell that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you smell the orange citrus smell in
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that diesel because I remember
smelling it and I'm like, so this has got
[SPEAKER_03]: that this candied orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: This had a slight, like a slight candied
orange addition to the pet, the pineapple
[SPEAKER_03]: express, which I didn't get off the sift
or the bud, but I still smelled the taste
[SPEAKER_03]: of the flavor of this and this in here,
which was pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you think about it, like he's using
terpenes, a terpene to extract resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty neat concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one day if we can, um, turn all of
these terpenes instead of just into a
[SPEAKER_03]: single terpene profile, which is what,
um, Horatio and Tony are doing at this
[SPEAKER_03]: point case, taking it to the next level
and he's fractioning them into individual
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe he's fractioned all of
them at this point in time, but when we
[SPEAKER_03]: can fraction them into their two to 300
plus varieties of terpenes that are
[SPEAKER_03]: present in cannabis, um, I think it's just
going to be an incredible way to come up
[SPEAKER_03]: with new ways to do things much like what
you're doing with d-limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets, it's, I mean, even when you look
at, well, what if we split it off and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I'm so look, it's scary because we
could do 20 years of just chasing these
[SPEAKER_01]: strains and the missing components.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have people who are going to
be able to isolate and say, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's up, we lost this strain,
but we know the difference between what we
[SPEAKER_01]: have and what it was, was this terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be able to recognize on graphs
or in like with the names of terpenes and
[SPEAKER_03]: the percentages of terpenes, it's going to
be graphs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be able to recognize like that's
Hayes, that's Roadkill Skunk, that's Super
[SPEAKER_03]: Fruity, that's Blueberry, that's Warlock,
that's God Bud, that's... The one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that I love about that because until we
can homogenize growers, I've found too
[SPEAKER_01]: much data of how easily I can manipulate
the dry sift in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, if it's in the heads,
forget the plant material, forget wood,
[SPEAKER_01]: forget everything else that comes with
you, which always had to do with fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: with bud for its own sake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, even if you spray smells on
this, once I get the heads off,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll be trapped in the chloroform
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I see actual sugars being uptake from
salt products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I get worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, if we follow the wrong terpene
profiles, if everything tested was tested
[SPEAKER_01]: with- Have you seen salts invade the
heads?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen sugars carry over that are
unnatural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely unnatural.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the point of distorting the terpene
profile completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like tasting bad or just- No,
tasting like pure sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like literally like candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely artificial candy to the point
of losing that medicinal entity.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not like just a strain thing that
you think that that's a food regimen
[SPEAKER_03]: thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because I've now been able- I just
went through organic versus inorganic and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing the actual result on the same
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I have two different growers
who've produced the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem was every other strain
this one grower produced had the
[SPEAKER_01]: persistent sucrose effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what if he was spraying that plant
with something while it was in flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: That to me is the only way that- I just
don't believe that the plant, the tricone,
[SPEAKER_03]: could pull it out of the plant matter into
the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of strains that produce
natural sweet taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why couldn't that be enhanced?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can fuck with the bricks level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by spraying with it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not that taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all these pina colada flushes
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about that insane side
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to the growing aspect of
fasting, you can only really ever trust
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to almost be in control of that
to know that your science is solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is what I looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what do you do different?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, I use finisher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what's finisher?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bulking agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it bulk with?
[SPEAKER_01]: It promises sweetener.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it promises that it can bulk with
sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how to do that to an orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how to do that to a potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this art form for very foods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you're adding messy things into your
plants, yeah, that's just mopped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's as bad as spraying your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like finishing it with these
flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm basically shedding light on if it's
in, if I'm finding that flavor in this
[SPEAKER_01]: head, that means it's what you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What stimulates the actual production of
terpenes in the mix?
[SPEAKER_03]: Phenols and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now I'm saying I know a product that
is negatively able to influence that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is there a positive side?
[SPEAKER_03]: But nobody does know a product.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even know it's phenols and
terpenes that are producing all the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: That are producing all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people have no idea of that simple
scientific fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just know what works and I get an
idea about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I always say, I said it to
Remo the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, listen, if you're doing a nutrient
company and you end up with a lab and some
[SPEAKER_03]: scientists, get them to look into how
cannabinoids are cooked into existence
[SPEAKER_03]: inside the glandular trichome head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you guys can start
understanding that relationship of how the
[SPEAKER_03]: phenols and the terpenes are produced in
these organelles, these vacuoles and
[SPEAKER_03]: plaque, these blasteds and pushed upwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can figure out why and how that's
happening, you might actually be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: feed the plant that gives it what it needs
to produce a higher concentration of
[SPEAKER_03]: phenols and terpenes, which then produce
all the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be, but people don't know
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm taking my agricultural
background and looking at it and going,
[SPEAKER_01]: wait a minute, I could never feed a field
full of oranges enough sugar to pump up
[SPEAKER_01]: the oranges with sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sugar doesn't come from sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's precursors though.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember from a child, if I can feed
my yellow canary carrots and change the
[SPEAKER_01]: pigment in its feathers, then I don't see
any reason why the sweetening agents don't
[SPEAKER_01]: persist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you read the bottle's
label, they say this grape flavor is to
[SPEAKER_01]: enhance the flavor of grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, but we don't grow grapes
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it doing here?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clearly to either, because I've seen
people make the note, oh no, we don't use
[SPEAKER_01]: the grape flavor on our OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, then you clearly
acknowledge that you just don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: mix the wrong flavor, but you definitely
support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a more, not the bastard end,
I don't think people realize there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: point in the natural fall season where
sugar just magically appears in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: for a plant to uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately it gives a pleasant
result, but I'm looking for medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find the more antiseptic,
the more wild the terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more chance it's going to be a real
experience rather than a sugar bear
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the easiest way for us to get into
the new, the next five to 10 years of
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene profiles that we're going to find
is to get into strains that do not produce
[SPEAKER_03]: large amounts and take a long time to
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's what mostly everyone's
avoiding right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where you're going to find
things that we'll have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that is so true in so many
other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is standard pump them out lavender
oil, then there's Mediterranean long
[SPEAKER_01]: summer, dry coastal season and that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only focus on, I want to be the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to focus on the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the complexities and subtleties I
need to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the French have the bomb lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, the thing is the French have
a natural condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to study and emulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, if I know this person
admitted, the only thing different between
[SPEAKER_01]: them and all the other growers is this
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I read the product and it says I
contain molasses and I contained magnesium
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate, which is Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it can get into the,
into the, um, the plant, the leaf and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, wow, if it's getting up
into the trichome head, when I could taste
[SPEAKER_01]: it, then I started, I'm like, this is an
abnormal amount of sugar for train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Train wreck is supposed to be a very
medicinal strain, not really as much for
[SPEAKER_01]: fun, but for effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this just tastes like a candy land
experience, a train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started asking, I just asked,
Hey, is there anything you know that they
[SPEAKER_01]: did different than you do different?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they asked and I said, Hey,
do you know, do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I looked at the product and I'm
like, okay, I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point of the salt is to bind the sugar
into the plant to raise its bricks level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a refractive meter, press the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much sugar do you contain?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a, we read this to project how
much sugar will be in the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the fruit of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they load that plant with sugar and it
doesn't flush, but it's not something that
[SPEAKER_01]: negatively affects burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would we know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you have to test it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing is I really want to test
what you taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know by that same, Chris wanted to break
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like honey than ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I've never had that on strings
that are testing into the GC would really
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, what I really would like to see is no
sugar added.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much sugar could you add?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much sugar is there on the GC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, give me a strain that hasn't had no
sugar added.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces tons of sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the ideal thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get your greenhouse and you're just
growing all these different varieties in
[SPEAKER_03]: three different ways from Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're doing like these tests
where you can truly not just control the
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction process, but control exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to have anyone's word or
trust of what they sprayed or didn't spray
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now that I taste it, I'm like,
whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I ask a ton of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I read every bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I, if you're in a position to interact
with your designated, uh, grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, one last one for you bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, that's kind of what's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a bad thing, but sugar's
not going to kill us in one, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, knowing that tells me I can go in
the opposite direction and find a new
[SPEAKER_01]: paradigm for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still believe for all the potential
marijuana has offered us, we've never
[SPEAKER_01]: offered marijuana the perfect grow other
than random outdoor instances where it got
[SPEAKER_01]: everything it needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil was what it wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, I just keep thinking about red
volcanic soils, cannabis, perfect drainage
[SPEAKER_01]: and the strains that are desert hardy and
hard to grow in indoor environments with
[SPEAKER_01]: high humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what Jamaica's built for in
the mountains where in the flatlands,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a whole different soil and a whole
different plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get, sorry I brought up Jamaica,
but I just literally saw it in my mind
[SPEAKER_01]: where I've traveled and, uh, how coffee
behaves and how you get your different
[SPEAKER_01]: grades of coffee just by changing
altitudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, amount of, uh, well, you just
imagine that high altitude Kush versus low
[SPEAKER_01]: altitude Kush.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you find out that high altitude
is producing a one in a million terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is whatever, for whatever condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day we're finding out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think someone sent me an article that
the liver has terpene receptors looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for citronella.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, why are you smelling for
citrus and the anti-cancerous properties?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, really a key there,
your liver is sniffing and controlling
[SPEAKER_01]: your behavior to see those terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, just like the science on us is we
will know more about how we're run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we'll run to the things that work
best, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be pretty exciting in the
next five to ten years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of exciting characters seem to be
falling with the right crowd to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of going for the short-term
product, realizing when the governments
[SPEAKER_01]: really start to pay attention,
when pharmaceutical companies try to take
[SPEAKER_01]: it all and legislate us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just got, it's been only about a
year since I've been applied for a license
[SPEAKER_03]: or been waiting for a license in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe even last like six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, you know, it's obviously been
25 years of my life in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: activism and the cannabis world before
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah, I just felt like when I saw
that it was happening, I thought,
[SPEAKER_03]: man, like the people that are getting
involved better be really good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just felt like kind of protective
of cannabis and of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could, you could imagine my
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't emphasize the subject,
but I'm clearly Jamaican and I can only
[SPEAKER_01]: conceive of like, what if Alichua was a
Jamaican product through and through.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be pretty satisfied to go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you plant oranges specifically for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's already oranges waiting to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is I just look at them like
there's new money in your oranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the orange industry dying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know I want your rinds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And come work with me and develop this and
all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to grow this with your oranges
and you'll actually produce better
[SPEAKER_01]: turpines, a higher percentage of limiting
versus the other turpines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I don't tend to be
nationalistic publicly, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I've developed in my own process to
something that is a competitive market
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative to hydrocarbons for large
scale production of medicine, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really concerned with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which you're going to dab in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm concerned with the thousands of pounds
of the invisible products that are not for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational smoking that are going to be
produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to rub on something that has
the frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you, if you're a spiritual person,
if you look at things as frequencies,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want that vibration going through
and adulterating my medicine on a level I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't prove, but I feel it and I know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the derivatives that people are
really going to be counting on to save
[SPEAKER_01]: their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the hope is.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the creams of the medicines and the
orals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I make a product that's competitive
recreationally and I'm proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're all smokers and we all like to
be, you know, be purists, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, at the end of the day, if,
uh, a bunch, if basically if arthritis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is afflicting many of us,
if even just in Jamaica, that was a simple
[SPEAKER_01]: give back program where, Oh my God,
I managed to isolate, develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a Turkey that punctures right
through the skin and gives relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm giving it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way further than what I could imagine
if I had gone to med school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know that, uh, the second that
CRD can acquire a license in Jamaica will
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely be calling you up a ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be exciting times to go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it will be absolutely taking the
limiting to, uh, to the next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course the dry sifts and the wet
washes and, uh, even giddy up,
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe is going to be down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be a big project if that,
uh, can get off the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just, you know, waiting every
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hear new news from Jamaica that the
cabinet is, is, is, is arguing the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the debating the facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess they're both parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bipartisan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both, um, everybody's on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally like the amount of things
they never thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got to give licenses for tourism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got to designate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are resorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically, it's overwhelming the
amount of subtleties to actually manage
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, licenses to grow
licenses for tourist attraction,
[SPEAKER_01]: lounges, spaces, designated smoking,
non-smoking beaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what people have dreamed of and
always that's what's always sucked is you
[SPEAKER_01]: go to Jamaica and there's so much plenty,
but you felt that same prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter who you are, no matter what
state is, I'm like, yeah, but you're
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking in your private location.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freedom isn't really there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it could lift an island economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back into a stage where they're endemic
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot get our son.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot get our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot produce these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's their niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica is Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why their coffee isn't a copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be copied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, it's, it's blowing their minds and
that's why it's going so slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every step of the way, it seems to be
the more they weigh out each factor seems
[SPEAKER_01]: the more it's going to be viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like they have a lot to go over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just, you know, I get I see the
releases in the newspaper and I post them
[SPEAKER_03]: on my Facebook account and it seems like
the last one covered a ridiculous amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll just see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully in the next couple of months
we're down in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to Jamaica next week,
this end of this weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to go check out the Bob
Marley 70th anniversary birthday bash in
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingston.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be going down there and meeting
up with Tony and we've got some other work
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're going to get done while we're
down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we'll just, hopefully we'll have
some videos for you guys down out of
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before that, we'll have Hash Church
out of Toronto this Sunday before I fly to
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess, Dan, Horatio, thanks for
coming out, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good puffing with your brother and great
products, all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will see you next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
