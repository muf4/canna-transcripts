[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with John H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Berfello, Mr. Meditator John himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's Wednesday, even though we're
actually uploading our last Puff Wednesday
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're actually getting out of the
game right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might see this the next Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really subject to any rules just
because we call it Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today John came over nonetheless and
brought me some pots, which was perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: timing because I had a few clones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medi-haze times two with roots,
an Afghani from the Great Gardener,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as a Barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured we'd just do a little
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I basically... I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I already filled up the pots that
you brought by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the smaller ones because I thought
I could use the space in the room and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these won't be the final size pots that
these plants go into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably transplant them in 10 days
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, if you wanted to go with the
Afghani and the Medi-haze... Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what I wanted to do first was
label your pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be doing this one as an
Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to write that down as an
Indica.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little check mark here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to put down today's day?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today would actually be May.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the month of May.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today is the... I'm not even sure what
the day is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third... 14th.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's the 14th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be the 14th.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only a week away from the... Champs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Champs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Champsies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you guys out in Toronto,
we hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come by the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 4.07 and 5.06.
[SPEAKER_00]: John and I have a booth together this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be pretty awesome,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to have a lot of fun there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please come on by.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll definitely... Meet some good folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good folks who might even do some huff
Wednesday sessions up on the rooftop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a vapor lounge there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so there's Barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbara.
[SPEAKER_00]: May I please have the tape, sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Piece number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And piece number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's Barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get ready and do a Medi-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medi-Kase number seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you call that a sativa or a hybrid?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say, well, it's very much a
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a sativa because it is Medi-Kush
crossed into... Medi-Kase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number five, Skone-Kase.
Hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which we believe came from 1992 because
that's what was marked on the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write it down as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to try to be as accurate as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best part about that is when I was
actually doing my video this morning on
[SPEAKER_02]: transplanting, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made mention of how I finally labeled my
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have made mention to that in my
videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually got some nice little white
stakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad idea, is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be marking my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never really gotten to the point of
actually carrying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we're growing it forward
these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow it forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to transplant a Medi while
we're sort of finishing it, while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing up your label there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've already moistened the soil,
the soil-less, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have had roots just for a couple of
days now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them to get too long or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, some rooties.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a gentlest little push and just cover
the puck up with dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I'm going to write for the Medi
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the guy that pokes in three fingers,
opens sticks, covers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you write number seven on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there was also a number,
I got a number nine phenol of the Medi
[SPEAKER_02]: Hayes that I kept too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it all accurate.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arboribud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it goes down the Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your sound effects when you go,
bloop, bloop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about boom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the boom, I got the bloop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of more plants will join.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of them in the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be building another tent here
real soon, shouldn't we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually doing the fine blueprints
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at the lighting, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at exactly if I can run some new
equipment in there to do some testing with
[SPEAKER_02]: some other strings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if it takes too long to acquire the
LEDs, I think I'm just going to go right
[SPEAKER_00]: away with some maybe different bulbs,
but the same NanoLux ballasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those ballasts are easy to hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so tent-friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really tent-friendly ballasts is
what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, they've done a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin that they produced was up to par
so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we should go puff on some of that
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's what we'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've managed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Barberbud Afghani and two Medi
number sevens, Medi Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for helping me out once again,
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey, I just bring you the tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and then you helped me even I love
this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share something that I put so much love
into and pass it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's going to get passed on and
come into you someday soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll look nice when one of these Medi
Hayes number sevens is a mom up there with
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, would you look at that beautiful
picture behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Sweet Skunk from the left to the
Congolese, Barberbud and Afghani on the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just surrounded in cannabis up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty darn nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in that direction and I can see
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, would that happen to be the watermelon
over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Astro Boy watermelon on the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right is the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't see this, but as we were just
describing, we're surrounded in this
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to see you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go have a sash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: John and I are just about to puff our way
into 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always good like that, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always warn us or let everyone know,
hey, it's almost 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always with the one minute warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sent me one yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a time to relax and enjoy the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cleaned some Barberbud Dry Sift for
the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be going to Toronto as well
at the champs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be in booth 222.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're over at booth 407 and 506,
mine and John's 20 by 10 booth,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you go see the great gardener at
his booth as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cleaned up a little bit of barb,
had some remnants, little pieces,
[SPEAKER_00]: little chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why don't we start you off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want a pre-420 rip?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is 417, so we can't wait three
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely a pre-420 rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're up, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: See a buddy pass and a buddy the first
rip?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I'm always kind of feels
like it's the least I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might get the one minute warning hit,
which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a 420 hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that ever look lovely just
melting away in the sun like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good old Barbara bud from the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check that out at the Vancouver
seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got beans down there for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to admit, I'm super happy to have it
in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must be pretty happy to have it in
yours, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin production on that thing alone is
definitely a full milk quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, um, super nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have a super full milk quality
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the barb and I got the Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: All three we know are full milk quality
genetics, which is quite nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark's got the one minute warning leading
into a puff one thing on a 420 and a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful sunny afternoon here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking right down the center there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on a beautiful view.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, here's where I get,
cause like you're going to puff right into
[SPEAKER_02]: 420, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost picked you up like 80 hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, are you seriously going to do
that to me again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Careful with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not on there as well as you think to
be moving it around and holding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll fall off is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're slipping it and like a drum stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have faith in the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get it on there very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be holding good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it, take it Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: John always deserves the 420 rip because
truly no one pays more attention at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll dab that up and look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might get one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 421.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean a four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get a 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as always on puff Wednesday we try to
do something as in to try and educate our
[SPEAKER_02]: audience on a few things and I mean basic
transplanting a 101 is just easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about the champs event,
that's going to be kind of another really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting how the whole champs
is all through the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and how much they have good reviews all
through the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be great to see them up
here running their gig and the
[SPEAKER_02]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get through the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and more people up here in the Canadian
industry and coming up here to educate
[SPEAKER_02]: about the glorious Canadian cannabis
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to just see a bunch of new
people come by the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be bringing a ton of product from all
three levels of bubble bags to the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: script sifting, wood frame screens,
metal screens, tumblers, bubble boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should pretty much have it all there as
well as skill tools and trippy sticks and
[SPEAKER_00]: oil slick type products.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course I'll be supporting
Medtainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medtainer is going to be a big part of the
booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the last of I think about 50 of
the high types cannabis cup limited
[SPEAKER_02]: editions left.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few of the Vancouver 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely be selling all my limited
edition and they will also be on special
[SPEAKER_02]: at the event there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely come by the booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, last year had a lot of fun at
the booth there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a good time last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good friends I hadn't seen in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to see Marcel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to be there with almost just
it was very it was my first treating
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself as many of you may or may not
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never gone to one of the events
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had unfortunately been written about in
the magazine treating yourself in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wasn't supportive of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sort of pulled my support out for
quite a while there and well that's never
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful to the community really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just thought it would be a good idea
last year to come back and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which turned out it was the last year that
it would be a treating yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's champs dash treating yourself
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be it'll be cool to see what's
you know the whole what what the vibe is
[SPEAKER_00]: still like and whether it's as as hyped
and as busy as last year or whether we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make get busier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to see a busier year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to see a lot of people
coming from the industry taking a look at
[SPEAKER_02]: having to help patients with the different
glassblowers and the different products
[SPEAKER_02]: that are going to be offered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one thing champs really
focuses on are the products in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and as like your bubble bags and
the skill of tools and with meditators and
[SPEAKER_02]: all the glass and all the different
products that are offered.
[SPEAKER_02]: D nails, you know, sublimators,
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a really good event to take a
look at all of the different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's always a good event when we get
to hang out with our friends and puff and
[SPEAKER_02]: talk what we love to talk about so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're blabbing on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we just took 20 minutes to
tell you the same thing about 20 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the sign of a good 420 rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guys, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've we found something to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't we, John?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a little review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a review actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a review of the not quite dried
Astro Boy fresh frozen whole plant extract
[SPEAKER_00]: that John and I did, I guess a couple of
days now ago that you grew that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: indeed grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very happy to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our flavors right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 25 microns, 73 micron,
90 micron and 120 micron, all very blonde.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the 120 is the darkest of the
four, they're all very glistening and
[SPEAKER_00]: blonde and full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what we're going to do is hit
them and talk about each each variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would if I know you took macro photo
to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a piece in here from the 90
when you first brought it out that when it
[SPEAKER_02]: hit the sun, it just glistened that you
like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, that one is for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because the way I looked at it wasn't
a mold that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even not in the sun, it still looks
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks glistening because you are,
this is your first run.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really thank you, but that is definitely
your who, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should we start with first of all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we just go down the line with the
25?
[SPEAKER_02]: Down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to try the 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your first in, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to rock that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock the 25 up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Birds chirping in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will definitely be able to see mine when
I was a little bit paying attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: this beautiful sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very relaxing here right now in the
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so peaceful and very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff away on a puff Wednesday and just
really, this is what it's about,
[SPEAKER_02]: medicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down the hatch.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: TGA genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like anyone, I don't even know how people
bash on TGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to bash on them here on my
channel and I'll delete you immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: because holy shit, they do some pretty
good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They release some really nice resins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supporting their community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing toy drives and raising cash
here and there for different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great, for 25 micron,
25 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was blonde.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally got me nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely got nicely medicated from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, I find that 25 is a little bit more
raunchy on the throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it, but definitely the flavor,
the high, it could be that it's still not
[SPEAKER_00]: dry as well though, because there is still
a tiny bit of moisture content in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we're jumping the gun
because we're excited and it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do this again in about a week or so
in Toronto and you'll see that this hash
[SPEAKER_00]: is much smoother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually going to go home and do a run
of my little pony for Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll definitely film that with my
little tripod and maybe I'll get my
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbor to come over and give me a hand
tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'd be kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely if I'll bring some of my
treats, definitely, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one are you feeling here,
John?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to jump onto the 120.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you are well deserving of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just dabbing so gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: A gentle dab for the John.
[SPEAKER_00]: My God, I can smell that in the air just
as I moved the dabber by my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny little bit of sizzle on the 120,
showing that there is indeed a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of moisture content still in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not so lucky to be able to get hash
really dry in 48 hours here in British
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at least in the coastal region where I
reside.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I guess I'm going to join
you with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a thick little.
[SPEAKER_00]: 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely have to say is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom Shankara.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say I'm still in recovery
mode here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, did that taste good though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taste on that was tenfold from the 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a different size gland
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure there's a science behind it,
whether those smaller heads are more
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbous or have a smaller terpene,
terpenoid content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, but wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the bio assay aspect, that was really
tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always what I've talked about so much is
the different smells or the different
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors that we get from every different
micron.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one thing that paid attention
to me when you showed me how to wash my
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, like really the
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like with me, I like the 73,
but the 90 fresh frozen works so amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to the 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has.
[SPEAKER_00]: That beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may be going to Asia or
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just up there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be up there again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be doing that scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess next up, we'll be ripping that
73.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 73, 73, we're going to hit the 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hitting the 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whose is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the one you said was going to
just stop everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that's like killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we were talking in the beginning,
we were talking about how this monster's
[SPEAKER_02]: hit was going to set you down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the last one did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one to set us down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dunk, not a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is definitely got some sizzle going
on there, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We made that yesterday at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're doing yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were actually making this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just because we've been waiting so
long to smoke this, like three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shibnits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shibnits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down with the dunking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that last one, it really, well,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That taste was, again, even better,
cleaner, and more potent than the 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't go wrong with the 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, that one was the smoothest out
of the 25 was made me cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 120 wasn't as much, but it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 73, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like three hits, though,
from my other two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That piece of 73 I hit was bigger than
both the pieces of 120 and 23.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the one we said was going to
glitch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should be good for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we do the 90?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three bowls in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to make pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to make pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been working all afternoon,
and we hadn't eaten yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the culmination with the three nice
rips reminded us that pizza's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pizza's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pizza?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good old pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good old pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you're just saying,
an hors d'oeuvre pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just very lightly coated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fucking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Followed by, of course, the 90,
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go the other route.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 90.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dessert after pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, another level of smoothness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say it's tastier than the 73,
but it tastes different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something attributed to the smoothness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoothness of it, but yet it still really
grabs you in the back of the throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drown that rip with some more pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy the birds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to hit this nice little piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've already done a close up on
it, so cheers, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: To your first 90.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that piece was so thin, there was
hardly no sizzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a lot drier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was drier.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, that was really smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we are jumping the gun here,
you know, kind of being a little
[SPEAKER_00]: unprofessional, ripping on the freshly
made bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smoking any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was four nice rips that I sure enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of them inspired pizza in the blink
of an eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just showed up out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't you notice that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of nowhere, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the doves?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were doves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were seagulls, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really fat seagulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked like doves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have wild doves that live in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I saw them, I thought they
were pigeons.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine who watches is kind of
into birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, those are doves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So someone's got some doves maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the train and they do the clapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's like 30 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's 30, sometimes there's
like just there are two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing gold eagles off this deck.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start using doves to
transport bubble house from here to the
[SPEAKER_02]: island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good little flyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've trained the doves in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super stoked that you guys watched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys were hitting a rip each time
we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was Astro Boy fresh frozen whole
plant extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say all around that I'm digging
the full profile from 25 to 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really nice rips were had in there
and I'm sure many more will be had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's definitely a fabulous train.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well worth the wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: TGA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, guys.
See you next time.
