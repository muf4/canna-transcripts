[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with my good buddy Chester.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody, how we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're on Yonge Street in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yonge Street in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we almost just got killed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd just like to start episodes with
Chester and I almost dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We followed these girls who were running
across the road and we thought the light
[SPEAKER_02]: had changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: It had not changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should have been looking at the light,
not the girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're out in front of the Toronto Hemp
Company in Vapor Central and I guess we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to head up to Vapor Central and meet
a buddy of Chester's and a buddy of mine
[SPEAKER_02]: apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's go meet them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, alright, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad that's a good case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Vapor Lounge here in
Toronto on Yonge Street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chester and I just came up and bumped into
some friends, some mutual friends and some
[SPEAKER_02]: new friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we got Chester of course in the
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Jessica in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jacob is here and Mikey is here so I guess
we're going to do some dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were kind enough here at the Vapor
Lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in Toronto, definitely come
check this place out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a comfortable vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got bomb rentals.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got vaporizers on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of nice kind of couches so you don't
get screwed and end up sitting on the one
[SPEAKER_02]: bad chair in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got comedy shows and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty cool place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's definitely a place to check it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they were kind enough to shut the
music off so we could film for about five
[SPEAKER_02]: or ten minutes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do some dabs and talk to
these guys about some of the projects that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're rolling out some of the data
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is LA Confidential with Jacob Groves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 23.6% THC tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bought from the boys at DNA?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loved on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I start you off?
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're rolling the joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm smoking John Gee, by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone wants to know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hitting a little fresh from the
master boy that I grew in my garden and
[SPEAKER_02]: processed just on the deck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit these two guys who clearly have a
strong passion for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see it bubbling right out of
the gate now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drip it and creating a big clear valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweating once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a sweater.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you grow some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just suspecting for yourself and for
some others as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got some patients and whatnot that
you're working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
How long have you been taking care of
them?
[SPEAKER_03]: About two years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the people have anxiety disorders.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it interesting that people that have
anxieties would love satemas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people that don't have anxieties
often are like, I don't really want to hit
[SPEAKER_02]: that satis, but it kind of gives me an
anxiety attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like the anxiety cancels out the
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too many people grow sativas by
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially 16 and 18 and 20 and 22 week
flowering sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes against the prohibition based
mentality of how much can I get and how
[SPEAKER_02]: fast can I get it.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did some Dr. Graves do this recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that just went forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 26 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really what we are doing is
trichome farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We order pizza for the pizza, not the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: The box would be more fancy if we were
supposed to do something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Astro Boy, which is a Apollo 13
male pollen smacker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that racy sativa vibe to it
through the C99.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had some haze there, some Neville's
haze crossed with some CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's CBD, Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one is CBD true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a never ending haze again.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to find a plant that ends out
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to find a pinot that ends,
and this one never ends.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just keep it going forever and
ever and ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's just one of those ones that
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's definitely got that hazy kind
of exotic spice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I know of as haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mikey's done some real life experiment in
using all of this out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on with the CBD stuff is
in our world, we've now found out it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: the fun out of the THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you are, you're going along.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're having a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, Mikey slides you into CBD
joint, and five guys later just go,
[SPEAKER_00]: what just happened, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like going out there and buying
yourself some pot, and when you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it, you don't get off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all kind of like pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD has that reaction to THC for sure,
like instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no thanks on the CBD today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys watch the channel at all,
Bubble Man's World?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know D420K on there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought some of his OG Kushtra.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have to hit a little D420K.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always loves when I shout him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, dude, that's awesome,
you're smoking my hash with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well we're back around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, okay, see if I can survive this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you roll another joint?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push it with the jars, hit the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in steady on the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everyone hits the D-nail the same
way, kind of just like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely better to kind of just
gently sort of pull it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Ellie Doe Confidential a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that plant in 10 pound sizes,
you know, it's just a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just, this mass in which you put her
on the California sun, she'll take like
[SPEAKER_00]: half the size of the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll work that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll work that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, cameraman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, these three or four of us are
coughing our minds out right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was D420K.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of you guys just hit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: so this is a dry sip as opposed to the
first one, which was a wet wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it interesting sometimes when I'm
smoking a water hash with people and they
[SPEAKER_02]: might claim that, oh, it has a bit of a
bite to it or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they can taste the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I like to say,
oh, actually that one was dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the dry sip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never exposed to the wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, we're just going to kind
of continue on and have a little session.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what we're going to end up
doing for the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might end up back with our good friends
at Weed MD if we end up going to see those
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another facility they might be
linking us up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might even go by the local compassion
club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were talking to Rob this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was pretty excited about some new stuff
going on for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was all over it, so good luck down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I want to thank everyone for being
on Bubble Band's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a nice little session with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them a little bit about your streams.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out the auto flowers, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out the joint doctor, bull rider,
purple rider, decent rider, all those
[SPEAKER_04]: employers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody notes some auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: 60 days from now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, nobody in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right, Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went very good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was keeping you all in there,
but a few times I wanted to zero in when
[SPEAKER_00]: you were doing the hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're back at our friend's apartment
with Chester, and Jessica, and Jacob,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Mikey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just got to hit the seven-year-old
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavorful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a... Terpy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tasted anything like that
before, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terpy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready for one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fucking lay it on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then give you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, take this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's exciting to smoke hash that's
seven years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke bubble hash every day,
but when I do, it's seven years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waste no whatnot, Mikey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, you're killing him.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is video gold, Chester.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mikey's hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you cashed it good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Chester.
Good one, Mikey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we puffed through these,
but there is some left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
See you next time.
