[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well I'm gonna turn this on and
we're gonna get into our positions We're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna talk a little talk a little schmack
with Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you brother It's been so long
since you've been here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my head was bald I don't even know
it's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have been like a child Welcome
to bubble man world everybody bubble man's
[SPEAKER_03]: world or bubble man world Yeah,
bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're welcoming you to and I'm here with
my good friend Johnny fucking B Johnny
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking B is in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he's outside of the house He's just
outside of the house, but you were in it
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier He walked very slowly greeted by
Walked slowly smashed again.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just a small little For those of you
that have been keeping track of the Johnny
[SPEAKER_03]: B dramas of car accidents Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It started with a dump truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it didn't it didn't start with the
dump truck I've been in a lot myself to be
[SPEAKER_03]: honest, but I feel like they they are
nothing compared So Johnny B got smoked
[SPEAKER_03]: like less than a month ago, maybe two
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you the picture Yeah,
it was it was I'll see let's put it up
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now they're looking at the picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so Pretty much I Got t-boned you got
t-boned.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it in your car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your car is all smashed to fuck it What he
needs ago, let's slide over to the next
[SPEAKER_02]: picture See how it's hit on the front and
I can see on my car was t-boned on the
[SPEAKER_02]: side of how the wheels have broken off
like that I actually was crossing through
[SPEAKER_02]: an intersection and he hit me as no brakes
no brakes full-on acceleration As we spun
[SPEAKER_02]: through the intersection, I thought I hit
a couple people on bikes So I jumped out I
[SPEAKER_02]: thought I killed somebody because I
remember seeing them on the bikes going
[SPEAKER_02]: through the intersection So just that
whole slow-mo action of the airbags going
[SPEAKER_02]: off and glass flying right out of a movie
right out of a movie and I came to a stop
[SPEAKER_02]: and I jumped out tried turning off the car
and You know what what the officer said?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God you were driving the Subaru.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that what he said?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Subaru Full airbags went off on the
whole car as you can see in this picture
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like amazing even have an
airbag in the side of the seat that went
[SPEAKER_02]: off like the whole thing it's quite
amazing actually, but it was a hard impact
[SPEAKER_02]: and You know on the next day I went saw my
doctor and then Didn't even move for about
[SPEAKER_02]: three days And now I'm in the sauce
therapy and you know, it's a it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: awakening of not paying attention and you
know what it's like I got rendered in 2014
[SPEAKER_02]: by someone texting and driving I remember
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just settled with ICBC a week prior and
I was supposed to be in trial that week
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wasn't gonna wasn't about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my health care taken care of stuff
like that, which is important for me And
[SPEAKER_02]: they won't pay for my hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: No trying that'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have to have these someone Has
to actually offer it first, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it's gonna actually be for sale and
I'll offer it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Johnny B Can I sell you some hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey ICBC hook me up with the check.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hook Johnny B up with the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what we're talking about now
We're talking about natural medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: full circle and it's you know,
they gave me some anti-inflammatories I
[SPEAKER_02]: went home and started dabbing some CBD
isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good to go Perfect low temp head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh How is that Wedding cake 120 micron
six-star bubble hash wanna hit that one
[SPEAKER_03]: more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep It's done it's done you want to hit it
one more time like with a little power
[SPEAKER_02]: keep me up so The reheat now we're doing a
lot of people putting the downs in the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom I mean, it's I mean, I I feel like
I got to know cold starting through The
[SPEAKER_03]: puff go peak the puff go be because that's
really what it does, but I think Bobby
[SPEAKER_03]: Nugs kind of Created the the hype on I've
just seen a few people like he did a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of articles and people wrote made
videos of them and it kind of went viral
[SPEAKER_03]: and So yeah, it's a great idea people that
want a cold start.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's cool For me with this unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just so happy to be able to blast Yeah
with the temp tech I can blast my my nail
[SPEAKER_03]: without you know, or my banger without
paying attention to the amount of time
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm hitting it with and then just
drop it usually I'll be honest I usually
[SPEAKER_03]: do it for maybe less than 10 seconds and
when I put it down It's usually around
[SPEAKER_03]: like 750 to 850 ready to go right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it to be able to I have to admit I
like heating it past The temperature and
[SPEAKER_03]: then dropping it there's something in the
heat retention there That's different from
[SPEAKER_03]: just heating it up to like 600 degrees and
taking it down There's there's a loss that
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel is better when I heat it up past,
you know It's kind of funny because we've
[SPEAKER_02]: used like from some of the subtle matters
to the D nails and all these Electric
[SPEAKER_02]: devices and I'm back on my torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like it better You keep talking
well the I'm gonna fix my torch What but
[SPEAKER_02]: the thing is is when I'm hitting with the
torch it's I always had the D nail on I
[SPEAKER_02]: come home and be like Getting it going and
stuff like that But I found that when I
[SPEAKER_02]: really want that terpy hit that I can
actually do a lower temp down Which is
[SPEAKER_02]: really important for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get up in the morning I want that terpy
taste and you know I used to turn down the
[SPEAKER_02]: D nail and stuff like that But you know
the torch is just something that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: be working extremely well other than you
have to my beauty But once again,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's all these different
devices out there That seem to work and
[SPEAKER_02]: the old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not even old school I guess the
old school would have been the dropping
[SPEAKER_02]: down before I or even before that the
mayor So we're we're back and ready to go
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a nice quick ten seconder I was
just talking about why I heard back to
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that I kind of like it I got I
got like I got I got I Don't have a D nail
[SPEAKER_02]: it on my room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have I have my mothership outside of
my garage I have my Jesse always say my
[SPEAKER_02]: hippo sits at the counter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my Lethal sitting at my computer
desk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take slinger with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: See I got all these little things that I
do and and it's kind of funny It's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's easier for me to medicate that way
than it is to actually like I Need now I
[SPEAKER_02]: need this this is important for me because
I've been burning the wrist counting down
[SPEAKER_02]: with temperatures using all kinds of
things, but the temp tech for me is
[SPEAKER_02]: something new game changer I Said I saw
the cold start and now it was I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: hang With d4 20k there a couple weeks ago
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, okay, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never done it before and then seeing the
temp tech is I'm pretty sure this is gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be a link on where to get this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Yeah, look it up for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had tons of people asking me since I
did my unboxing video It's just a great
[SPEAKER_03]: little tool and for those of you that are
already gonna write Oh for $15 you can get
[SPEAKER_03]: a laser thermometer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can for $15 You can get a laser
thermometer And you can hold it under your
[SPEAKER_03]: banger and it totally works.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is way more expensive, but it's a
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a unit It's got its little readout.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got its little light.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it you can create or control the
emissivity levels, which is basically
[SPEAKER_03]: There's different emissivity levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been learning for different surfaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: So quartz is generally point three point
nine three to point nine four I have it
[SPEAKER_03]: set on point nine four right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I don't know what that's not so
Yeah, it's just like the laser It's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: hit the surface and how it measures that
surface and what that surface is will
[SPEAKER_03]: change how it measures So you tell the
laser what the surface is and then it
[SPEAKER_03]: accords and adjusts accordingly So I
didn't know I still might not be
[SPEAKER_03]: explaining it There's always some
brilliant person watching who if I have
[SPEAKER_03]: miss explained that to Johnny B by all
means write it in the comments I think we
[SPEAKER_03]: should just keep taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would what would you like to hit?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have some some treats from the
heavenly days.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is that's what I just hit Some
heavenly days give thanks to heavenly days
[SPEAKER_03]: and concentrated acts who was the producer
of the wedding cake full melt 120 micro
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been kind of sounds like a big truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of big trucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw all the new stuff Going on so you
know for a for being in the middle of
[SPEAKER_03]: nowhere, which really look at can you see
my neighbors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm literally on the side of a mountain
and there are still countless monster
[SPEAKER_01]: trucks Let's see what he's doing He's a
big one, you know why Actually getting
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to lift all the hash that we have
been making all month long So we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: about six thousand pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we do the deliveries gonna
come in What we have to do these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we're getting to those levels of
making that well taking to the levels of
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going on How would Mark said it
years ago?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said there's two types of hash dealers
those that require forklifts and those
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't Team forklift and team forklift
team crane new hashtags for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's good to see Dude, it's been a
while since it shared a bowl with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked on our Facebooks and You know,
I always get that A little too that was
[SPEAKER_01]: around 650.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it to be around 850.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like of course Well, I don't want to dab
at 850 I did that now now we're at 850 and
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll take a few seconds It'll cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you dab at 850 a for one,
it rips into you really quick and as you a
[SPEAKER_02]: for two It just kind of like as is the
banger hardcore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you see all my bangers for
chas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were they were hard C- Yeah,
I have one that's non chance not chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my I have my chas extra chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good Go go Johnny B Yeah, she's a sliding
she's a slipping go sir Oh, yeah It's
[SPEAKER_03]: always nice to carb friend give a little
twist on the directional shout out to JP
[SPEAKER_03]: and Toro This is one of my favorite
bangers and carb caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I think I could easily say it is
my fang favorite Banger and carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't yet tried the turp slurper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have tried it before And I haven't tried
the core reactor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big like half gram gram down guy
It's not not of a high interest to me to
[SPEAKER_03]: do such Things, but I love the idea of the
core reactor that big chunk of quartz I
[SPEAKER_02]: was watching one where that's the heat and
it goes around the outer edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a center that saw the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's endless Innovation and it's in
one with the ball bearing spinning Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some here we go that clean and
nice like it clean Now that was tasty
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think it's what I just hit but if
not sure I'll hit a little piece Skittles
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what I just hit but I'll
try again and I'll confirm It's yummy
[SPEAKER_01]: showed up to the camera We're really
close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm getting up and then you got to
put your hand behind it too So it focuses
[SPEAKER_03]: on the half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm skilled at this I've done this in the
past And you can kind of get hopefully a
[SPEAKER_02]: good look And you get an idea there you
go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like Right here behind the
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the man behind the hash Please to
meet you all It's nice to be sitting back
[SPEAKER_03]: on a sunny day and just taking a few dabs
it's just a lot going on these days I look
[SPEAKER_02]: at this amazing goodness that is like
really if you're dealing with like I
[SPEAKER_02]: always say concentrates for a pain And
really understanding how like just natural
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine It's funny how it's came so far
so quickly but yet You know so much more
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to be explained on how this works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So well, the reason is why we do this That
was delicious Yeah, it's like it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: delicious the turps I thought it might be
a little bit different because I know
[SPEAKER_02]: there was some different
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought it was the special special
and he gave me a small pile But knowing
[SPEAKER_03]: row he gave me the big pile of the
skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So give thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's much appreciated That was
absolutely delicious and tasty got me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not I rate No, I ray It has to be comatose
after the accident you didn't I needed it
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just the most amazing like you
actually did a dive it and you were done
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice Yeah, I do also appreciate
doing like three or four dabs in a row
[SPEAKER_03]: with a friend or six You know,
just having a good time
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed not much else to share with you
guys other than we're both busy obviously
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B's been doing tons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing tons just focused on all
things embark focused on Whistler
[SPEAKER_03]: Technologies and focused on travel a Lot
of traveling So I've seen you see some
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty amazing sights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some amazing fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think hopefully eventually I'll
get to all the videos So we had a crew
[SPEAKER_03]: come with us to Spain and film a ton of
stuff I put one teaser up on the channel,
[SPEAKER_03]: but hopefully we'll get more and then I
still have Jamaica to post which I put one
[SPEAKER_03]: video up so far But I probably have like a
good three or four other videos and then I
[SPEAKER_03]: also have Columbia And I'm sure there's at
least you know two or three good little
[SPEAKER_03]: clippage videos from Columbia going into
the mountains in Cauca and Seeing all the
[SPEAKER_03]: coca plants and the cannabis plants
growing side-by-side It was pretty neat
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure You'd have definitely been
tripping out and loving it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a big problem it's it's funny because
you know, they should Honestly,
[SPEAKER_03]: you should be selling that data to help
Canada, I've been actually compiling now
[SPEAKER_02]: spreadsheets and taking a look at dad and
taking a look at who's doing What and I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to know who's got control?
[SPEAKER_02]: Packing rooms who's using the there's
different ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing so he's in abduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: We learned this whole It'd be good to have
like a like an actual like they over
[SPEAKER_03]: regulate everything except the important
things like regulating active water
[SPEAKER_03]: content and and the way you package in the
SOP package under like make those
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations not ridiculous And here's a
great one, but patient focused patient
[SPEAKER_02]: focus So I'm gonna hit you guys in your
pocketbook and I'm gonna go after canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: So they left 151 million dollars on the
first quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tested all their cannabis at 42% 44 and
46.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's my question How much did they
lose in evaporation in money wise that
[SPEAKER_02]: alone because you're now you're looking
at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hundreds of thousands of pounds and when
you're losing eight and ten percent water
[SPEAKER_02]: put that in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and really and and and and if you
look at that then you're gonna start
[SPEAKER_02]: waking up because when you can't control a
Packaging room to package the product you
[SPEAKER_02]: put so much money into growing There's a
problem 50 million dollar facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think the packaging room would be
state-of-the-art I could pretty much tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you right now if you package that 62%
watch if you made any that cannabis would
[SPEAKER_02]: come in roughly about 52 53 inside the
container So you have to actually package
[SPEAKER_02]: around 68% and those little tests that
I've learned right and these little things
[SPEAKER_02]: that I hope you guys start listening and
you start learning The same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a little bit complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just moisture content.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's active water content Which is
different than moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is considered.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the product and the space that
surrounds the product Not just the product
[SPEAKER_02]: not just the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important to understand I'm
learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been learning for the last six months
and and really understanding, you know I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing actually even what well as
producers are probably coming up with the
[SPEAKER_02]: better products because they're doing
certain Well, we should do a video For my
[SPEAKER_03]: channel dude, we should do an active water
video test.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the bumblebee just went in the
House he lives in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bumblebee that lives in my
birdhouse One single bumblebee.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I put my finger in there Yeah,
I was seeing if he was around I put my
[SPEAKER_03]: finger and he'll like step on my finger
and I can pull him out of the House
[SPEAKER_02]: without probably was the bee that landed
on that Kush plant years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just been hanging Yeah, he's got his
endocannabinoid system all saturated.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just like lady Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my medicine He's like Johnny B,
but he's bumblebee bumble fucking B Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: but active water is a really important
subject and I want to go deeper into it I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to have you over and I want to do
like a test of two or three varieties And
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll just we'll walk them through it
We'll explain the difference of active
[SPEAKER_03]: water versus moisture go in as deep as we
can and I know he's been sharing this on
[SPEAKER_03]: his own channel Which you guys can check
out at John Berfalo, but I want the
[SPEAKER_03]: content for this channel as well and
Johnny B Needs another reason to come out
[SPEAKER_03]: to Lions Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right I need to sit down and
actually explain it because my content is
[SPEAKER_02]: in bits and pieces of my videos because
I'm always doing I've done a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: testing but sitting down and explaining it
as in let's get some canvas Let's talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about all the different seals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what companies are doing And you
can talk about all the different packaging
[SPEAKER_02]: and what packaging and how it's testing
and active water and seeing what's drying
[SPEAKER_02]: testing stuff that was packaged almost a
year ago by one company and it's still
[SPEAKER_03]: coming Let's buy a bunch of cannabis I'll
pay for it and then we will do the active
[SPEAKER_03]: water test and then we will I guess I
wouldn't want to waste it, but it would be
[SPEAKER_03]: a good show to do like, you know rosin
where half of it is used without the
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage brought up and half of it is
used after being started doing this Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I started actually re-humidifying and
pressing and stuff like that but on small
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts because I like the RAM at the time
and stuff like that and you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: that'd be great because you can actually
really see see what strains are where the
[SPEAKER_02]: see the the AW is at like 36% this is low.
[SPEAKER_02]: No forget breadcrumbs That's really low.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be like almost like powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pasta is 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got that stuff at 29 and it went to
dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: 29 is ridiculous Everything to do with the
seal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course when the company knows it
and they also must realize like that seal
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's going Then are the terpenes
consuming whatever that material was that
[SPEAKER_03]: what type of seal are they using?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a chemical glue?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it something that shouldn't be consumed
by terpenes and then inhaled by a patient?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I got something to show you Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: See this is what's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why We do what we do and why we
get so actively involved because it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: passion of being able to see and how
things react inside containers inside
[SPEAKER_02]: different things little great products
that come to you and you get to check out
[SPEAKER_02]: new little little devices and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my machine in my car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I carry that thing with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no machine for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: No machine for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is as simple as like going like this
and pushing air out Then you can open it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It creates a small vacuum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice glass jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear it right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have that one Because you were
just saying we get these cool little
[SPEAKER_03]: products so Canlock sent this to me and I
just thought you know what like maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll have Canlock sponsor us in our
testing of cannabinoids water content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll buy the herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've already supplied the containers
Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So companies like Bavodas companies like
Canlock look I like this company because a
[SPEAKER_03]: very simply you can create a vacuum And
you can suck look now my button doesn't go
[SPEAKER_03]: down anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just all the air is out now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen And you notice they make it a size
for an herb smoker Like this is not a hash
[SPEAKER_03]: jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it is my hash jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong I'm gonna use hash but
this is a perfect jar for like a flavor,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you got your
[SPEAKER_03]: This would keep it real fresh,
you know, although I'd have to look at you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, is this a PTFE is this Yeah,
exactly, it's gotta be it's gotta be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to withstand Degradation from terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll ask them about that So,
yes, you can have that one I like it
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you could put some maybe you can put
some herb in it and leave it in there for
[SPEAKER_03]: like 30 or 40 days And then we could do
the active water content test.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, how about we do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh That goes around here So this goes in
there Which fits into here?
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only a half size.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it should be smudge up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect
[SPEAKER_03]: Packaging holy shit on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna say it's not okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by a gram of say some weed from some
old friends weed MV and The package is
[SPEAKER_03]: this big Like one of these came in a box a
box with a container in the box in the box
[SPEAKER_03]: inside a plastic plastic not too different
from This actually comes inside the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nonetheless, well, this is how we come
to you Yeah, because they put in another
[SPEAKER_03]: box.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to make ourselves available to the
audience to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do I want to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do this active water test I want
to show them what it's all about kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: get them online and So what we're gonna do
and I think the best thing we're doing is
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody come here I'll bring some nicely
fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some peanut butter breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nicely in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You saving it I'll bring that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll test the AW.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put it inside The jar will seal it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put it away the AWC Now I've gotten
in trouble I know that because he's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: these head researchers He's the main QA
guy and scientists like that Willie did a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of education and this guy Brian is the
head quality control and the science guy
[SPEAKER_02]: behind the team of Boveda
[SPEAKER_02]: He educated me on active water,
so I really had to learn about it and he
[SPEAKER_02]: said I was saying things wrong How you
just certain things are really
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of how much water is inside
of a container that goes we did some
[SPEAKER_02]: explaining Yeah, we're definitely gonna
have a good show on this and talk more
[SPEAKER_02]: about it for sure Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave a show bring the charts that are
printed out to have more of a discussion
[SPEAKER_02]: on looking at the charts and what levels
to look at and then we're molding to start
[SPEAKER_02]: forming that's why a lot of these people I
would say would be more concerned about
[SPEAKER_02]: how much active water is in the cannabis
because I think health cannabis scared
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody away from being Being able to
sell fresh cannabis Instead of when it
[SPEAKER_02]: says right on the container keep dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big problem on every container
that says keep in a dry place And it says
[SPEAKER_02]: dry because they're so worried about mold
they've dried it out beyond I'm seeing I
[SPEAKER_02]: see a lot of consistency Between the 44 46
percent marks, but I think that just has
[SPEAKER_02]: to do with packaging I can see I can tell
you what promises were packaged in because
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see how dry it is by promise sure
and I can tell you we're what's package of
[SPEAKER_02]: right across the country by Its active
water content inside the cannabis and BC
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to be the highest out of everybody
across Canada highest percentage We're the
[SPEAKER_03]: rainforest, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, even when it's dry, it's pretty
moist Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some super high humid a little
things that I've seen that's cool Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's quite an interesting research little
thing I've been doing the active water
[SPEAKER_02]: testing since Christmas I think all the
machine on Christmas Day the day before
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas Awesome, I wasn't expecting it
but it was something that I had really
[SPEAKER_02]: taken a look at and was able to talk about
how to standardize cannabis and my whole
[SPEAKER_02]: theory was through
[SPEAKER_02]: Moisture content because I wanted over the
moisture in campus exactly that content to
[SPEAKER_02]: be consistent And that's where I was
educated on a W and I was saying it wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: relative humidity No, it's moisture and
it's neither All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is it we're learning with
Johnny B here on bubble man's world we're
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely gonna come back and Revisit
this in the very near I would hope yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we should we should do a good good video
when we break it down and show everything
[SPEAKER_03]: and then in the meantime I'm gonna load up
a dab of strawberry banana for Johnny B
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna call it a day so I can
actually go visit Johnny B without being
[SPEAKER_03]: on camera That's kind of like got to save
some of our friendship for but it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: so long since the wheel hung out together
You know what everything what are you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So busy did great things I know it's um,
which it's what we say you're changing the
[SPEAKER_02]: world as we're seeing it today when it
comes to cannabis extractions and Banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, guys, thanks for tuning in quick
one from Johnny B You You
