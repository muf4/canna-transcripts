Hey
[SPEAKER_00]: brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another Puff Wednesday is upon us and I
find myself sitting next to this character
[SPEAKER_00]: in these flimsy little Puff Wednesday lawn
chairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these chairs are gonna go with us
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are gonna see these chairs in
every Puff Wednesday now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty fun, you know, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit wet out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, welcome everyone to Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puff Wednesday, November... I don't even
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's seven days before my birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, 11, 12, 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be like the 14th and the 15th
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something.
[SPEAKER_01]: 14th?
[SPEAKER_01]: 15th!
[SPEAKER_01]: It was... It actually... We just saw this
amazing moon the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, the supermoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The supermoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The supermoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was just the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we are now sitting here in my
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very cloudy when we came out and it
has since... Well, Johnny said let's go as
[SPEAKER_00]: high as we can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, simultaneously, of course,
we've been doing the beautiful time lapse
[SPEAKER_00]: of the clouds dissipating over the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like totally like clamped in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It opened right up and it's like... Nature
at its best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we really, you know, we haven't had
much planned for today's Puff Wednesday,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we thought let's get outside,
let's puff a bunch of bowls, and let's
[SPEAKER_00]: show these people some drone footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's kind of the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some sift from...
[SPEAKER_01]: The trim bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's start with getting high on
Johnny B's sift from the trim bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're gonna show you this under the
macro video camera as well as the macro
[SPEAKER_00]: camera, photography camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can see the quality of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice little sheen on the edge
of it because he's had it in his pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't be able to clean it up,
but we will... Well, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to... I thought about
putting this in the freezer and smashing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you get that resin and it's
already like passed that point you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: sift it, like when it's stuck to that
card, I was gonna like freeze it and smash
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lovely smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mixes of kush, from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what it was, a great friend of mine,
he was harvesting and he was using,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, his... Maybe he wanted to use
an organic grower and that's why I really
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, dude, those trim bins that you
made me get, I'm like, yeah, he goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: get resin from him and he goes,
and I want to gift you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, he brought me over a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, and it was in the beginning,
it was nice and it was melty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see what it's like now after a
little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it kind of started doing this
because it's in my pocket and I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: carrying it around because it's... I've
been sharing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this bag was like half full.
[SPEAKER_01]: This wasn't like a little... This was
three times the amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even squished some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pressed some on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells pretty good, I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with a little iron and gave it a
little squish and made it pull and made it
[SPEAKER_01]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to start this Puff Wednesday off
correct, thanks to Johnny B and his gift
[SPEAKER_00]: that he received of some... Well,
I'm not sure if it's going to be full,
[SPEAKER_00]: full melt, but we're going to test it on a
big nail right now and see what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: residue is left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got some star ratings to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to pass me the torch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is very cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a dab or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get myself one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always bring two dabbers because you never
know when a friend's going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't bring one and this guy brought me
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B, you need to have your own dabber
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so quiet here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can hear a pin drop from a mile
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a beautiful afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific West Coast, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to squish this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: How'd that one go for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, look at the residue in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little bit, a little bit of resi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carboned it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too, too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming off the, off the nail,
but still a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have to torch it a tiny little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only heated it up for a very short
amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was hitting bubble or oil,
I probably wouldn't have gotten this same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of, actually it's cleaning up a lot
better now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're deep in the fall experience
here now in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are deep into fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 29 days of rain out of 31 days in
October, which was pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't hit that just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be probably too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's timing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like three, two,
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like wait, ding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't hit it just yet myself,
but it's gonna, it's going to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B likes hot rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a hot rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an eight, nine hundred or Johnny
B.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really find the difference between,
I don't think you'll agree with this
[SPEAKER_01]: between like say the dry sift hit with the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then from that, like being rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think there's still a
substantial amount of contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sift does look really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's more than likely,
you know, in the, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 to 90 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave it that much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It melts and that's what I pressed it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did melt at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just carboned up really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be interesting to see how it
squishes, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you used the Sasquatch press?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dude, I've got one in my office.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can easily squish that out for you if
you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what just happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought sift and you know what's going
to happen next, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect we're going to go squish it in
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just go like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how much I love to squish things,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't, I haven't had the pleasures
even using the Sasquatch yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, why don't we take this
particular resin right here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show you guys what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of have an idea what it is
we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By no means the lowest quality.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're going to, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still nice to give them a little yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be like three or four grams,
no?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll weigh it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll weigh it and we'll find out what
kind of returns we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we take them, go into the office
and squish that out in the Sasquatch
[SPEAKER_00]: press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to squish this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see oozing resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's bring them with us and we'll
take you guys now and go squish some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Johnny B and I are inside the office
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the bubble man's world customs
plate from the Sasquatch boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B's put his hash in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we weigh it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pass that scale that's over on the desk
over and we'll give it a quick weigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it was exactly what I thought it
was going to be 0.2 on the screen and 3.4
[SPEAKER_00]: on the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, 3.8 altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get that back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plates heating up at 245 degrees and of
course the rosin press from Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash in the parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lift this little guy up to expose the
plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to operate the press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're in business, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might've crushed it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be exposing hash into the actual
oil because you literally closed the
[SPEAKER_00]: plates right down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a perfect press.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little bit of a oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to open her up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's open her up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be just beautiful oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out a little, it came a little bit
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's usually this lighter color,
but it sure looks thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we do guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We squish our hash and that is definitely
something going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's like the sift has
bubbled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we blew out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, just beautiful oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, beautiful oil guys from a trim
bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, would you ever think that you
would get this from just trimming some
[SPEAKER_01]: weed in a bin, grabbing the press,
squishing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well let's collect it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was quite an experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw the squish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very fearful that there was a
contamination occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the macro lens out and there
definitely was some minor intrusion of dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so melty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually, some of it squeezed right out
of the bag, but we managed to collect a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of real nice pieces and we're going
to try dabbing it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you have six star hash and
you squish it and you squish it into hash
[SPEAKER_00]: and rosin, it's still kind of a pretty
nice fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a beautiful drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I photographed that drip and it's pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I will show right now, you can see pure
rosin, no hash contamination there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of dabs for us as well
that we collected here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't I just, do you want to go
clean the first dab and then we'll do turp
[SPEAKER_00]: dip and after?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that idea because we can do both
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to set the base and know what
we're doing and what we're hitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what you can do with
your sift if it melts all together and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's in one big goo ball and you want to
get a little extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to separate out the oil,
you squish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very doable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned so much from squishing over
the last, you know, since it all kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: exploded on the internet and I did my
little video there and, and I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: squishing with my hair straightener
forever and we've seen all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: presses come out and you know,
one thing I have to say is, is that
[SPEAKER_01]: Sasquatch squished it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little different from using a hair
straightener and clamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works very quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really squish that well
sometimes as we saw last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm quite happy with the Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I went a little too squishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little happy there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the carb over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually I have it, so it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoping you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoping you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see what he thinks of his trim
bin dry sift rosin that we just pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitting a nice clean piece that was very,
take that sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that off a little bit for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to join you here in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passing you my dirty Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, what the?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to pass me his Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you guys pass your dirty Q-tip
to your friends?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seem like, here, can you please take my
Q-tip?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about completely nothing
because that hit actually hit me pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, I was kind of like,
I'm still seeing that, that, that squish
[SPEAKER_01]: oozing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've seen it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we did it once like a long time
ago when Rick was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually sat down and did an epic
squish of some, of course, 73 micron
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Squishy squish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that half squished like, I think it's
on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just these two big drips like this
one is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was good to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little smile from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice thing to see.
Resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling pretty, pretty good about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: About to hit this dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little carb cap action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I'm really seeing with the
carb cap is I have this one that has a
[SPEAKER_01]: little hole in the top and the way the
direction goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it pushes the air on the back of the
bowl and you can actually move the resin
[SPEAKER_01]: around and a little things that actually
that we did in the last puff Wednesday
[SPEAKER_01]: when we did the really low temp dab and we
did that drop in the middle and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the way it kind of bubbled up and
we're just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was seeing what the other carb cap I
was using the other day is how it's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: little hole in the back of it and it can
actually push the resin around by moving
[SPEAKER_01]: the wind around with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learning more and more every day of
course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd like to try it with a turp
dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like turp dips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you pull yourself out a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe from your drip with your dabber and
then I'll pass you over some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: turps and we can get turp dipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the flavors I brought out were
white cookies, Crown Royal, both from
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always going to bring OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's really kind of funny is
it's actually this resin was nice and
[SPEAKER_01]: gooey, but because it's so cold out here,
it's snapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard as a rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard as a rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time we're going to let it cool
proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So exactly like he said, because it's
been, um, sitting over here in the cold,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's this little, nice little sticky piece
of a rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at how fast it melted in there
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, that's one thing about what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's where we're out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always, always liking the OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was more talked about in the last
Haas Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about the different terpenes
with the OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the different cushions and outaxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was talking about an ointment that
we're working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what he likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what he's about to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what he deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's getting a nice low temp dab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B for the win on a puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can really smell that OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, truly held that particular
terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B's without words.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say it's just so smooth,
but then I had a cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm really, I'm really finding like,
I'm trying a lot of different terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: different people that have different
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, that last one with the dip
with the OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the terpenes take it to a
different level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really truly do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's do a little of that then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just giving them a... I like levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to sit in the backyard in the
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little bit of a plane flying by
right now, but otherwise mostly really
[SPEAKER_00]: quiet, relaxing sounds in this backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bell's going off in John's head,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He deserves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to relax and you know,
for a lot of people, like for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: my puff Wednesday is my puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the carb cap?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right here for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it on upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stuck with it and you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of it, I got a great hit bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of felt like whatever I was doing
really wasn't a very good way of
[SPEAKER_00]: describing what I wanted to have done,
but I was in the middle of taking my hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for meeting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never, never, never live when he's trying
something's not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to figure that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, look, that cleaned real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a real nice low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now feel the effect of that with what I
did with the turp now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I felt it instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like it's... The second the
dabber hits the nail, I taste that turpene
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and then I don't taste it as much
until I exhale and then it's pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: almost all I taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's time to show these guys a
little bit of what's going on out in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of us right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a short break here and give you guys
a little drone footage.
What
do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epic as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always amazing to see the perspective
of drone footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely, you know, well medicated,
if you will, well lifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, both of them were.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty trippy how you're having fun
with the controller, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see what we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of... You guys will be able to
check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already have actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were laughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's just a full... Anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I guess, you know, Johnny B and I
both have things we got to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we wanted to come finish it off with
another puff or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying like get some D420 stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got that really nice D420K rosin
that I pressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: With his absolutely beautiful OG Kush
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty darn near perfect right
there, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even in the cold, it's sticking to my
finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a part of what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pound it out with the dabber in your hand
so you stab me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I changed the hand knowingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see that dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the cleaner one of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I can clean with my two fingers
and we can be dabbing in an instant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one might take some next level
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have a lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you just had it in your pocket not
too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so let's get you a D420K rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will...
[SPEAKER_00]: torch up the piece for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want a Terp Dipper or a tasty
D420K's OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you might want to taste it
first.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just totally down for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some really good tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some good resonant work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice bud for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice B on the hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good when it's tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready for one of those nice and cleans
but I gotta torch this up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I'm just thinking about
that surprise birthday party.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really a nice time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was happy to have made it and placed
some dabs with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I'm going to show up at your
surprise birthday party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to go to the airport that night
so I just managed to make sure I could do
[SPEAKER_00]: it both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the good quality and the season
coming up and the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Four Five is coming up and someone
planned, a good friend planned a surprise
[SPEAKER_01]: birthday party for me and it was coming
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came around a corner and it was just
like, I'm smiling about it because it's my
[SPEAKER_01]: birthday week so I'm kind of smiling
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really, really awesome.
Well deserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just thinking out loud and I'm just
sitting with a big smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of speechless this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a lot of good things going on and a
lot of good people in the life.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on with the whole change,
with the election, with all of the new
[SPEAKER_01]: legalizations that are happening across
the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these great things that are
happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're sitting in a room full of all
your friends, like 40 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, it's just been- The
cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about shouting her out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well the cake was, it was me sitting on a
meditator holding a mothership filled with
[SPEAKER_01]: raws and then crystal- Surrounded by buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surrounded by buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then was it 10 layer like mousse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, chocolate mousse infused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one even knew it was infused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well I did because I got pretty high
after eating three pieces of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People, the whole cake, it was like this
big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a huge cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really stepping it up for the
people out there, the chefs and the cooks
[SPEAKER_01]: out there that are able to just pull off
some epic, amazing desserts and just all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of different edibles that just work
because they know that I like my edibles
[SPEAKER_01]: and so do a lot of other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was definitely the first part of the
cake that was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept the bong, the top half of me,
the legs fell off.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little pink My Little Pony on
the cake, so that made everybody laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epic times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, dude, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you filmed a ton of it,
too, on what show was that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: filming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Campus Culture News Live on PAW TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was me showing up and they weren't
in the studio and I'm calling Jared going,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the hell are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Wayne is like, look, and I'm like,
what's going on over here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came around the corner and just like
boom, room full of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, you know, it's just like one of
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, it's not my birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started seeing all people like from
the valley, from over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, wait a second here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's not my birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those moments of life that you
never forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you come running around the
corner here and I just smile from ear to
[SPEAKER_01]: ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was good for a few dabs for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, no, it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a lot of messages from
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the event was a couple months in
advance for a few people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of cool to see people even
come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: From out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool man.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that they managed to keep it a
surprise because that's always the hardest
[SPEAKER_00]: part of a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe you all did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, holy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well deserved, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: You deserve a surprise birthday party with
all your friends to celebrate your
[SPEAKER_00]: existence and your awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say, so was Puff
Wednesdays, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a short but sweet one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured, did you want to end it off with
another big rip there with one D420K
[SPEAKER_01]: dipped in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll get you sorted out for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what, the best part about,
yeah, you know what, it was just good
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like yourselves that are surrounded
and then all the people that came down to
[SPEAKER_01]: support exactly what we are about in this
industry of the plant and how we love what
[SPEAKER_01]: we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the pulling the bags or making the
sieve, from squishing the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, like you said, the quiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember he goes, you got the quiver
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a quiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the one he said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a quiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're just about to get OG Kush
white-cookied out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then came the dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then came the dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quiver and then the dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the quiver and then the dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do remember the dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this time about four years ago,
I think, because it was around my birthday
[SPEAKER_01]: just before that we did the dips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the dip of the history of
the dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's beautiful.
It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terp dipped too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get up and show it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I will pass this over to you when
your banger is just at that perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature that you can get a nice little
rip without burning your throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of planes flying overhead today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder where everyone's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two, three, four hundred people at
a time at a schwack just flying right over
[SPEAKER_00]: top of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: How psychedelic is the world when you
really think of that many people floating
[SPEAKER_00]: in space above our heads multiple times
since we've sat down to do dabs?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of people flying around the
world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's amazing that people have
such a hard time believing that there
[SPEAKER_00]: could be unidentified flying objects when
there are so many identifiable flying
[SPEAKER_00]: objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to think that, geez, it wouldn't
be that hard to make one look a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different and have someone see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got yourself an identified
flying object.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good, Tony B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what a perfect note to end today's
Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're going to keep puffing for a
little bit here, but Puff Wednesday as is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for watching and thank you,
Johnny B for coming as always and spending
[SPEAKER_00]: time with me on Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week, we will be back full force with
an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please don't fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoy our short little Puff
Wednesday today.
We'll see you then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.
