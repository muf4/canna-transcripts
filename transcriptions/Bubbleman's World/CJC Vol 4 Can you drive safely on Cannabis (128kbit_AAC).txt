[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, welcome to the Cannabis
Journal Club where we review and interpret
[SPEAKER_01]: United States cannabis patents and
cannabis journals and scientific journals,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, with concise overviews of complex
scientific literature in an understandable
[SPEAKER_01]: and easy to consume manner to expose the
knowledge hidden in the scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not claim any medical utility and we
definitely advise you to obtain your own
[SPEAKER_01]: copies of these public documents and share
them with your doctors and family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further ado, I would love to
introduce the man of the hour,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. David Allen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, Dr. Allen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Dr. David Allen and this is Budley
Green and today we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: driving performance when you use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it safe to use cannabis and drive
your car?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a complex question actually and
it probably depends on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially your experience at using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this article that we're going to review
is a NIH study, National Institute of
[SPEAKER_00]: Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a government study and you have to
look it up yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article is titled Sex Differences in
the Effects of Marijuana on Simulated
[SPEAKER_00]: Driving Performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great study and it doesn't
give us all the answers, but it gives us
[SPEAKER_00]: some information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they did is they took men and
women and they put them on a driving
[SPEAKER_00]: simulator and they would have stuff run
out in front of them like animals or cars
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would test their reaction time
and whether they were able to avoid a
[SPEAKER_00]: crash or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tested the same person before
they used cannabis and then they had them
[SPEAKER_00]: use cannabis and then they tested the same
person after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in table two, if you expand table two,
it clearly shows that women had no
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in reaction time or crash
avoidance or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a remarkable thing in itself,
that it didn't change anything at all for
[SPEAKER_00]: women.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in men, they had 1.1 second faster
reaction time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three times better crash avoidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this limited study, you're actually
safer driving your car when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: inebriated on cannabis than you are when
you're when you're straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be a lot more studies before
this is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, there's not a lot of people
crashing right now and there's a whole lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that you're probably a safer
driver when you use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also add to this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've mentioned this to people many
times in the past that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing to alcohol in particular,
alcohol is releasing inhibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's allowing you to make decisions
that are not smart decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all sorts of people, most people,
90 plus percent of people absolutely are
[SPEAKER_01]: of the belief.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like a Dunning-Kruger effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people drink alcohol, they suddenly
think, oh, I can totally drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is really the danger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the danger that they're so
impaired.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the danger that they don't know
they're so impaired and they decide
[SPEAKER_01]: they're able to drive on the flip side
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people I know, if they get
uncomfortably high, the last thing they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do is drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not say, hey, give me the keys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're just high and they don't feel
100 percent comfortable, the part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain that allows you to make a proper
decision that isn't frozen by alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption allows you to say,
I'm not going to drive right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that plays a big portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I know I've known people my
entire life that have driven under the
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say the other part of asking,
is it safe to drive under the influence of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is the getting pulled over by the
police part, which is definitely not safe
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit different than what we
talked about in the study, but it
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely also has another effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, Dr. Allen, thank you so
much for sharing this wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: information on the Cannabis Journal Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have put the link to the patent or the
study story in the description of this
[SPEAKER_01]: video and points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll leave it to you to to finish us
off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so cannabis is its own governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're if you're smoking cannabis and
like Marcus said, you don't want to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it prevents you from driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and if you drive and it makes makes
you drive slower and you're more careful
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to avoid crashes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hope God blesses this chapter of
Cannabis Journal Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And job over evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live it.
[SPEAKER_00]: God over evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
