[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fairly epic piece by Ghost
and this particular piece has been
[SPEAKER_00]: electroformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got just, I mean, let me get it off
the stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not your average piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to pull off the stand is a bit of an
experience, especially with the bowl here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably best to remove that first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you pull it right out, drop that bowl
back in, which I have a slinger bowl in
[SPEAKER_00]: there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull this off to the side and I can kind
of give you guys a little bit of a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's got this incredible brain
marble up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got just immaculate detail in the
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actual metal components that
have been electroformed right onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: The base is completely metal, not glass at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually quite a sturdy piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just wouldn't want to grab it around
these canes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a very delicate place on the
pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And otherwise just once again an
absolutely stellar piece from Flav.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we get to it and load up a
little sweet skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little fat bowl there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the matches from HQ,
from the crew at HQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, a piece like this really could
throw you off if you didn't know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: puff it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is a unique piece in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the cut bowl by slinger so it makes
it nice and easy to do the layback rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Flav.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you glass artists worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you cannabis growers and hash
makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all make this experience the wonderful
experience that it is meant to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World and
we'll talk to you soon.
