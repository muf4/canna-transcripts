[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to Hash Church 2.0.
[SPEAKER_19]: Today's episode is the past, the present,
and the future of Rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: And let's get right to it and invite in
our panelists.
[SPEAKER_19]: This morning has been a little bit
chaotic.
[SPEAKER_19]: I will not lie.
[SPEAKER_19]: Had a little bit of technical difficulties
with a few of the different panelists.
[SPEAKER_19]: High pressure yesterday.
[SPEAKER_19]: We came in on a phone, so he's not going
to be able to make it in today.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're hoping for the best with Solvent
Zero.
[SPEAKER_19]: Although he could not hear me,
and I'm hoping that you guys can hear me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's just figure it out here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good morning to everyone in church.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Hash Church is live.
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like so far so good.
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like people can hear me,
so that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've sent out the link, and I'm just
hoping that it's going to work out rather
[SPEAKER_19]: well today.
[SPEAKER_19]: So far, we have 275 people in the queue
watching the show.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good morning, Chris M.
[SPEAKER_19]: and Tara Lee, Mass Melts.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is who wasn't able to hear me
earlier, so let's hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear me now, Matt?
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear me now, Matt?
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we'll see if he can hear me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, welcome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's your Instagram name, just in case
you don't want me using your actual name?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 2Turn2Skirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2Turn2Skirt.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, welcome, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm very glad to have you in here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was very impressed with the photos that
you'd been posting on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_19]: and that's really kind of what got you an
invite in today to our conversation on the
[SPEAKER_19]: past, present, and future of, oh,
why not have panel before going live?
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, let's answer this, because people
always love to ask this question.
[SPEAKER_19]: What happens when I go live, sorry,
when I invite the entire panel in before I
[SPEAKER_19]: go live?
[SPEAKER_19]: What it's done in the past is it's lost
the camera on one particular person for
[SPEAKER_19]: the entire show, and it has not given me
the ability.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I've learned from Google and
YouTube is that I need to go live and then
[SPEAKER_19]: invite the panel in.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's going on, solventless mind?
[SPEAKER_19]: In the house, Matt in the house,
double Matt in the house.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got Sasquatch in the house.
[SPEAKER_19]: Matt and Joel are there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see their camera.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_20]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_20]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_20]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys don't have a camera working or
what?
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just showing the logo.
[SPEAKER_20]: Here.
[SPEAKER_20]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is why I love to do testing prior to
the show going live.
[SPEAKER_20]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_18]: There he is, man.
[SPEAKER_20]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like the, I like the busy wall behind
you.
[SPEAKER_19]: It reminds me of my busy wall.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I just got my new office, so it's pretty
chill.
[SPEAKER_20]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you hear us a solventless mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was having problems with the other Matt
from solvent zero.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's not able to hear this morning.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got him on mute right now,
but he's going to try and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got two turn to skirt in the room as
well.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure you guys have seen his awesome
photos.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm pretty sure Matt and you know each
other at least, I think.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure if we met, but yeah,
always good work, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate everything.
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I got my unit set up right here
today for a little bit of pressing just
[SPEAKER_19]: because I figured my team might try to get
our sun on the sun as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Might as well, when in Rome when we have
the rosin conversation, I've been excited
[SPEAKER_19]: to have this conversation.
[SPEAKER_19]: It definitely doesn't have the same
history as hash, so we're not going to
[SPEAKER_19]: have Chris Bennett open it up with 20
minutes of epic hash history.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am one of the few people that calls
rosin oil.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know a lot of people in the community
call their oil hash, and maybe it's fine
[SPEAKER_19]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've just kind of grew up more old school
and I've always kind of deciphered a
[SPEAKER_19]: difference between oil and hash,
a beautiful difference, not definitely
[SPEAKER_19]: thinking one's better than the other,
but I do see a difference, mainly in the
[SPEAKER_19]: sense that only the greatest quality hash
will melt into a liquid, whereas even the
[SPEAKER_19]: shittiest oil I've ever seen in my life
will also melt into a liquid, so it's not
[SPEAKER_19]: really a way to decipher quality when it
comes to oil.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's different ways that we decipher
quality.
[SPEAKER_19]: The melt factor is not one of them,
and I often see people say, oh,
[SPEAKER_19]: my BHO is six-star, and I'll be like,
well, star rating is really the melt
[SPEAKER_19]: rating, so I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe we need to come up with a new rating
for oil that's based more upon the quality
[SPEAKER_19]: or the texture or those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just wandering off here into the live
chat, we've got a bunch of people,
[SPEAKER_19]: 459 people in the room right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully, everyone else is getting the
link.
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess I'll send out the secondary link
to the other group of guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had a couple of reserves in place.
[SPEAKER_19]: A couple of different Rosin Press
companies, actually, Peer Pressure and
[SPEAKER_19]: Evolved.
[SPEAKER_19]: I sent them a link right now to see if
they want to come in as some of the other
[SPEAKER_19]: people are taking their sweet time.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm really hoping that Compassion can come
in, because he was the guy that first
[SPEAKER_19]: posted Rosin Tech online years ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got to be 12 or 13 years ago,
maybe more.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know the ICMAG post was done on 2006,
but I was certain that he had done one
[SPEAKER_19]: prior on Overgrow in 2003 or 2004.
[SPEAKER_19]: I could be wrong about that.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why it would be great to have him
in here and tell the story.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome, Lindsay, I believe that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: When other people don't show up,
the reserves get the link, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll definitely go through and do an
introduction.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone can, at one point, let each
person go through and talk about how they
[SPEAKER_19]: got turned onto cannabis and how that
eventually led them into extracts.
[SPEAKER_19]: Ideally, how it led them to producing
Rosin, which, of course, we all love to
[SPEAKER_19]: call a solventless oil.
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas, you know, that is a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's definitely hydrocarbons,
terpenes present in these oils.
[SPEAKER_19]: But hey, I've been known to use it myself.
[SPEAKER_19]: There it is right there, the solventless
quiver.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we do use that term, but it is a
misnomer, kind of like strain when we're
[SPEAKER_19]: talking about cultivars.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think we're going to be.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Chad's not making it in here.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's too bad.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, welcome, Eric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how's it going, everyone?
[SPEAKER_19]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got what do we got?
[SPEAKER_19]: We got three Rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, we've got one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we've got three Rosin press
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we've got three Rosin makers so
far in the room right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know Hash Church isn't really about a
commercial, but obviously you're going to
[SPEAKER_19]: be able to mention your company name.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going to be able to mention the
technology that you guys came up with and
[SPEAKER_19]: how you guys came up with it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's obviously a positive
conversation.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not here to outsell one another on
our machines.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're just here to kind of share
information and let everyone know what's
[SPEAKER_19]: going on in regards to, you know,
Rosin production.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've got seven people, 533 people in
the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's Honey Butter, Rosin Co.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just joined.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's up, Honey Butter?
[SPEAKER_19]: Another dude with some fucking sweet,
sweet pictures, some sweet little videos.
[SPEAKER_19]: Always love to see your Rosin,
dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, I love that you've got the
headphones on.
[SPEAKER_19]: Your shit's working and we're dialed in.
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe maybe we'll start off with some
introductions.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really did want to kind of start with
the past.
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess I could send Chad a quick message
to see if he is around because we
[SPEAKER_19]: definitely need to, we need to get him in
here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Another person, I should have been testing
it out yesterday.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's saying that his plugin is blocked
right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how to fix it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, not my computer.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, well, another time, my friend.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So Compassion is out.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to have to tell the history
for him.
[SPEAKER_19]: I suspect, I still believe it was a little
bit before 2006, but let's just say the
[SPEAKER_19]: first ICMAG post that we saw was on 2006.
[SPEAKER_19]: This was Compassion producing.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was coming out with the Rosin post.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know if any of you guys
remember that.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was very unique.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was, it was symbiotic for bubble bags
because it was all about teaching people
[SPEAKER_19]: how to make oil dabble product,
which you know, back then we weren't
[SPEAKER_19]: really dabbing.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you remember, I was always hitting
along with Skunkman Sam and a few others.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were, we were kind of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were hitting it on a stainless steel
screen.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were wafting the flame back and forth
and allowing it to bubble and bubble up.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so the highest quality bubble hash,
of course, would create large big clear
[SPEAKER_19]: domes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that was the pre-dab dabbing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Chad came up with this method where you
would take the subpar hash that wasn't
[SPEAKER_19]: melting.
[SPEAKER_19]: He would place it in a double boiler,
like a metal or a glass bowl that was
[SPEAKER_19]: inside boiling water.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he would put the hash inside the bowl
and with a metal spoon, he would gently
[SPEAKER_19]: melt the oils out of the wax membranes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And what would happen was you'd get these
oil sort of wall.
[SPEAKER_19]: It would just like coat the side of the
wall and you would go around with the
[SPEAKER_19]: spoon.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a very, very slow process.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would definitely say that it did not
take off and it was not popularized in any
[SPEAKER_19]: way, shape or form compared to what
Soilgrown did when he first squeezed a bud
[SPEAKER_19]: or some hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to the room, by the way,
Soilgrown.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good timing on that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just telling the story about compassion
right now, producing the first rosin
[SPEAKER_19]: thread back in the mid 2000s on ICMAG and
Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so what happened was you ended up with
this ball of wax after you milked it
[SPEAKER_19]: around the bowl and the bowl itself,
you could take a razor blade and you could
[SPEAKER_19]: scrape it and it would shear off this like
white, beautiful oil.
[SPEAKER_19]: No one had ever seen it at the time.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was definitely mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that to me is really, you know,
we could always go back a little bit
[SPEAKER_19]: further in the past.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've had people tell me about pressing
hash back in the day and pressing it way
[SPEAKER_19]: too hot and way too hard and ending up
with some oil in the end results,
[SPEAKER_19]: like squeezing out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm sure that happened in the third
worlds in Lebanon and in Afghanistan when
[SPEAKER_19]: they were really hammering that hash down.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm certain that there was product that
was, you know, collected and, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: treated very specially.
[SPEAKER_19]: But in our community, the first time we
really heard about it was in mid 2000s
[SPEAKER_19]: through compassion when he wrote the post
on rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it basically got forgotten about
until.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, for those of you that want
to say this, listen, any time you give the
[SPEAKER_19]: history or your story on something,
there's always going to be someone that
[SPEAKER_19]: comes in and says, that's not what
happened.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is how it was, blah, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't think any of us can deny that
when soil grown first squished the bud or
[SPEAKER_19]: the piece of hash, I'll let you tell it in
your own words here in a few minutes,
[SPEAKER_19]: that that was really the true beginning of
the rosin tech.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's where our conversation started in
hash church through soil grown.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would be hard set to say that any of
you that have developed a machine or that
[SPEAKER_19]: have developed techniques in regards to
this, if you follow back your history,
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm quite certain it would start with an
Instagram post made by soil grown.
[SPEAKER_19]: So why don't we let soil grown give us an
introduction?
[SPEAKER_19]: Just imagine a lot of people are watching
that don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let us know who you are.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let us know when you got into this and
give us that story one more time for hash
[SPEAKER_19]: church.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you've told it a few times,
but the floor is yours, my friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, what's up, guys?
So.
[SPEAKER_14]: So soil grown basically started back in
like 2013.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just washing hash, started getting known
just washing hash and stuff, water hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then basically got out of my
dispensary and then I started making hash
[SPEAKER_14]: at home.
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't really know much what to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just like mostly made it for the
head, smoking it, ran out of my melts.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's when so back in the day,
like the three, four star, I would press
[SPEAKER_14]: with the hair straightener between some
parchment, try to thin it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was able to dab it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wasn't trying to make rosin at the
time, but I was just trying to dab
[SPEAKER_14]: something that wasn't very melty.
[SPEAKER_14]: So further down the road, started running
out of all my full melts, wasn't enjoying
[SPEAKER_14]: dabbing three, four star melts.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, oh shit, I skipped something.
[SPEAKER_14]: So go back in the beginning when I used to
press out the hash, I accidentally pressed
[SPEAKER_14]: it out too hard one time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I noticed that there was, the shiny
oil on the outside and all the contaminant
[SPEAKER_14]: in the middle was nice and dry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't think anything of it at the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I pulled it all back together,
repressed it, was able to dab it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shitty hash, dabbed it though.
[SPEAKER_14]: So skipping way back ahead, running out of
all my full melts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically that a light bulb went off in my
head.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thought about back when I over
pressed it and realizing that there was
[SPEAKER_14]: the shiny and then the dry.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when that light bulb went off in my
head, I actually just grabbed a piece of
[SPEAKER_14]: hash and I put it between a piece of
parchment paper and I pressed it on the
[SPEAKER_14]: nail with my finger.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's when I was actually able to see
that the oil was coming out of the piece
[SPEAKER_14]: of hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so basically once I opened up the
parchment, there was tiny little drops of
[SPEAKER_14]: rosin in it, basically.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd say for about two, three,
maybe a month I was, that's how I was
[SPEAKER_14]: pressing rosin.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, then basically I grabbed the
hair, not a hair straightener,
[SPEAKER_14]: a hair curler.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I started using a hair curler after
that, and I wasn't working very well.
[SPEAKER_14]: My wife came in, she noticed I was using
her expensive stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: She gave me some broken hair straightener
and the hair straightener killed it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was pressing hash in between
parchment with a hair straightener,
[SPEAKER_14]: no screen.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would collect all of the oil around
the sides and smack the dry hash out the
[SPEAKER_14]: center.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's how I was making hash rosin back
in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then from there, ran out of all my
hash and another light bulb went off in my
[SPEAKER_14]: head.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we took a bud thinking nothing was
gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: And sure enough, between the parchment
paper and the hair straightener,
[SPEAKER_14]: oil came right out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was just, we were all in awe.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, yeah, and it just continued to
evolve from there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I showed friends, I posted online and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then word got around.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the next thing you know, lots of
people were asking about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The next thing you know, I'm on Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's when the screen came involved.
[SPEAKER_14]: People started pressing through screens
and it just kept getting better and
[SPEAKER_14]: better.
[SPEAKER_14]: So basically that's the story of how I
stumbled across rosin tech.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a major aha moment when you really
think about it, because anyone that's ever
[SPEAKER_19]: squished with a hair straightener has
known that if things don't line up
[SPEAKER_19]: properly, if you're not hot enough,
if the buds not good enough, if the
[SPEAKER_19]: combination isn't just proper,
you don't get anything.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've pressed many buds where I've just
seen a hard bud cookie come out,
[SPEAKER_19]: a flat cookie come out at the end and not
see any oil.
[SPEAKER_19]: The first time Tony and I went to Jamaica
for the High Times Cannabis Cup,
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say the first six to seven people
that came, we just had the old de-nail
[SPEAKER_19]: manual press.
[SPEAKER_19]: There was no other machine.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was basically a t-shirt press,
but they took the plates off and they put
[SPEAKER_19]: very small five inch by five inch plates.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it wasn't the full size t-shirt press
with the little manual hand.
[SPEAKER_19]: And after five or six times, both Tony and
I were like, listen, I don't know if we
[SPEAKER_19]: can keep doing this, this bud,
there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it wasn't until my friend Omar walked
up to the table and slapped his buds down
[SPEAKER_19]: that we squished and saw this beautiful
gold and oil come.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, what's up Joel?
[SPEAKER_19]: Just saw you in the corner of the screen
when Matt coughed there for a second.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we were like, oh my God,
thank God it works.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it's, you know, it's that aha
moment for you, soil grown to me was a
[SPEAKER_19]: major thing because, and also the fact
that you tried it with a bud, because
[SPEAKER_19]: let's be honest, not everyone has hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the minute you made that work with a
bud, that shit was a game changer.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because now anyone could, I thought
immediately I was like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_19]: like you've actually saved lives in a
sense because, and not in the sense like
[SPEAKER_19]: people dying, I'm sure it's very rare,
but we know people blow up and they burn
[SPEAKER_19]: their houses down making oil and then
making butane.
[SPEAKER_19]: Butane was the first, like I hate to use
the term like wildfire, but it really did
[SPEAKER_19]: spread like wildfire because it made it an
opportunity for young people who didn't
[SPEAKER_19]: have a lot of a connection to the
community to suddenly just be able to grab
[SPEAKER_19]: a can and grab some bud and blast and have
this oil.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, when you squished that bud,
you took that away from the BHO community
[SPEAKER_19]: in a way that you offered something new up
to the community that to me, I mean,
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not a religious person, but my God,
that was a godsend for young people who
[SPEAKER_19]: are otherwise, I mean, think of all of you
guys that are producing presses and
[SPEAKER_19]: inspiring people to make this solventless
oil.
[SPEAKER_19]: As we say, it really is an inspiration
beyond anything you can imagine because
[SPEAKER_19]: people were blowing up, they were burning
themselves and wearing those burns for the
[SPEAKER_19]: rest of their lives.
[SPEAKER_19]: And let's be honest, cannabis is such an
amazing thing that the worst thing about
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis should and always will be the
DEA, not us blowing ourselves up and
[SPEAKER_19]: wearing scars on our face for the rest of
our lives.
[SPEAKER_19]: As a parent, that's pretty sickening.
[SPEAKER_19]: So props to you, soil grown.
[SPEAKER_19]: You definitely lit a fire in all of us.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure, I'm not sure anyone on the panel
can say that they were inspired outside of
[SPEAKER_19]: what you did.
[SPEAKER_19]: I definitely give it up to Tony V and to
Nika T who were also using the hair
[SPEAKER_19]: straightener to press their bubbles to get
it into a dabbleable form.
[SPEAKER_19]: When they had dry powder, they put it in
the parchment.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's what I saw right before you
came out and started pressing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw these guys pressing bubble really
lightly.
[SPEAKER_19]: They weren't making rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: They were just pressing bubble that maybe
for me, when people ask me how I prepared
[SPEAKER_19]: my bubble, I just squeeze it between my
fingers there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got a dab, but we're in this new world.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're in a world of everything being a
tech.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that I heard you before mention
that you had seen Nika T or Tony or both
[SPEAKER_19]: of them pressing with a little hair
straightener.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was my first rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd have to say much respect to Nika T.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if it wasn't for seeing that,
how he was pressing out his hash back in
[SPEAKER_14]: the day, thinning it out, I probably
wouldn't have pressed it out too hard and
[SPEAKER_14]: even came across that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, I mean, it's really coming.
[SPEAKER_14]: It starts to come out that bubble hash
from where I learned it from was Nika T.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, it came from an accident,
basically.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, some of the best things do come from
accidents.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll say this and I'll say to all the
people out there who are constantly like,
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to enter the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to start a business.
[SPEAKER_19]: How do I do it?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, well, you know, I'll give you a
little Gary Vaynerchuk because what you
[SPEAKER_19]: need to do is you need to fall on your
face and you need to not be afraid of
[SPEAKER_19]: making mistakes because mistakes will lead
you to what I call the aha moment.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was an aha moment Soil Grown had
when he slapped that butt in that
[SPEAKER_19]: parchment and squeezed it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was people in the community doing
and sharing things that led him to be able
[SPEAKER_19]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's no single person that's
innovating and coming up with things.
[SPEAKER_19]: We all get to stand on the shoulders of
giants.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why I'm very happy to have all
of you here today with us for this
[SPEAKER_19]: episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess what we'll do is we'll go
through, welcome Ozzie from Elysian.
[SPEAKER_19]: Research just popped into the room,
dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess I'd like to do a little
introduction.
[SPEAKER_19]: This could probably take the next hour
considering there's nine of us in here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it looks like Two-Turns is about to
rip a bowl.
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, you do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: You do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: You rip that bowl because we're going to
start with you, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got you, Elysian, Eric from Pure
Pressure, Solventless Mind.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll basically let you guys know.
[SPEAKER_19]: But Two-Turns, why don't you give us your
history?
[SPEAKER_19]: How you got into this and how you figured
out it was your passion?
[SPEAKER_19]: Tell us a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, like three or four years
ago, I started seeing everybody posting
[SPEAKER_02]: more stuff about Rosentech and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of caught my eye because I've
always been just one of those people that
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to smoke the best quality stuff and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it started off with getting some
bubble hash that my friend got that sucked
[SPEAKER_02]: ass, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he needed something to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and cleaned it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just bought a bunch of mesh and would
fold it up over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used straightener for that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I took a break from squishing for
a little bit with the straightener because
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a hard time getting into things
unless I have the proper equipment to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I waited until I saw some of the first
presses come out and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, I got my first press and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just pretty much started getting all
the best quality flour that I could and
[SPEAKER_02]: experimenting and just testing stuff at
different temperatures that I hadn't seen
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing people do stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I also do construction and
electrical work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I learn a little bit of stuff from the
industry that I work in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I take that and try and bring it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lot of the newer stuff,
whenever I started in the last two or so
[SPEAKER_02]: years, when I upgraded my press and
everything, got a better one with more
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure and everything else, I was able
to develop more of a good technique and
[SPEAKER_02]: able to find better hash because you know
how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As time goes on, things kind of just got a
little bit better with the industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so probably about two years ago,
I started doing my first butter chips with
[SPEAKER_02]: the hash and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kept trying to find stuff that was
better than what I could make.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just always wanted to produce the
best quality stuff with smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it got to the point where
everybody wanted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started producing for everybody else
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, it just kind of took
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always just liked to experiment
with different temperatures and
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, a lot of the stuff that I
found out was found out by accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best way to figure things out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I figured out how to make the
saltiness sauce and how to butter things
[SPEAKER_02]: out really well and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, here's one of your shots right here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely breathtaking.
[SPEAKER_19]: Looks just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: Super quality.
[SPEAKER_19]: Definitely the shot that I was like,
oh, I'm inviting this guy in for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what was it an Instagram post?
[SPEAKER_19]: Where did you first hear about Rosin?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just heard some friends talking about
from seeing it on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I started kind of looking into it
more and researching some like forums and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that and Googling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then looking through Instagram and
just kind of hounding every kind of thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that I could find information on Facebook
and stuff like that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just started finding anything out that
I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I found like a lot of stuff I got
a lot of information from Alyssia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, when they posted a lot of
melting points and stuff like that is
[SPEAKER_02]: really whenever I started being able to
like tone in a lot more and figure a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that helps a lot whenever you can
find out the melting points and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with the hash and turning it
into the Rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah, the numbers and the data are
definitely going to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love the fact that, you know,
these companies when I just met Eric and
[SPEAKER_19]: the guys from peer pressure, I was really
stoked on their digital readout that holds
[SPEAKER_19]: all the different pressures and like it
was I'm sure he'll end up talking about it
[SPEAKER_19]: at one point in time.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's definitely great to have all these
different Rosin makers as well as Rosin
[SPEAKER_19]: machine makers.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the combination of the two is
definitely how we're going to move this
[SPEAKER_19]: forward into, you know, the last hour of
the show, which will be the future of
[SPEAKER_19]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll all get to talk about where we think
that's going.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, thanks for showing up to turn to
skirt.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess we'll move over next to Elysian
research.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys want to is I'm not sure if it's
you, Ozzy, or if it's your partner.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, right on, dude, why don't you tell
us a little bit about you guys and how you
[SPEAKER_19]: came to be with Elysian research.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess Instagram is actually very
instrumental in kind of making things
[SPEAKER_13]: happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Forums, everything else.
[SPEAKER_13]: At some point when me and my me and my
partner actually ran into a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_13]: that slow grown was actually doing at the
time.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was incredibly instrumental for
myself as an engineer, because,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, I saw a lot of the equipment
that people were currently using and
[SPEAKER_13]: everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this was definitely an area where,
you know, we thought we can try to help
[SPEAKER_13]: out in some sort of way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And along the way, doing all the research,
doing all that work.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just very important for us to share
all that information with the with the
[SPEAKER_13]: community in general.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, but I mean, besides that,
we pretty much just got started.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was all just happenstance in the sense
that we just met, things clicked,
[SPEAKER_13]: and we're both kind of on board.
[SPEAKER_13]: Historically, I've always been a smoker.
[SPEAKER_13]: My business partner is actually a farmer.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's and being an engineer,
that's kind of where we were able to come
[SPEAKER_13]: together and actually make our current
unit and sort of develop all the research
[SPEAKER_13]: around it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I had myself on mute while I was
bong ripping.
[SPEAKER_19]: Tell us a little bit about your unit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: So our current unit is actually a 30 ton
unit.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all CNC machined, all made of like
some crazy tool steel and whatever the
[SPEAKER_13]: hell else, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Essentially, the whole point for us was to
make a medium scale unit that can actually
[SPEAKER_13]: essentially outperform a lot of others.
[SPEAKER_13]: And essentially increase the output.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was pretty much our main goal in
that respect.
[SPEAKER_13]: And as far as that's concerned,
I believe that we actually we were able to
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of hit a mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: But also it was it was very important for
us to actually keep all the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_13]: here in the US.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, doing that and actually
getting all that together and everything
[SPEAKER_13]: was actually quite complicated.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was nice doing so because,
you know, obviously we're able to deal
[SPEAKER_13]: with all these like American suppliers and
everything, which, I mean, just makes the
[SPEAKER_13]: whole engineering process a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_13]: Besides that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we're actually using our electric
electronics for our.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, for our plans, which,
as some of you might know, our electric is
[SPEAKER_13]: actually, you know, company, but they've
actually designed and they've well,
[SPEAKER_13]: they've redesigned some of their
controllers to actually be able to supply
[SPEAKER_13]: power to our unit.
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing about our unit is that I
mean, it really only uses like five
[SPEAKER_13]: hundred watts, but it's it's rated for a
thousand watts.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and that's one of the nice
things about actually having a nice
[SPEAKER_13]: digital controller.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I actually don't have very much
experience with a lot of the other
[SPEAKER_13]: machines, but I know that everyone has
their own merits and everyone has their
[SPEAKER_13]: own strengths, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's it's really interesting to kind of
just be in this form and essentially and
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of hear everybody out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have any photos or video of your
unit?
[SPEAKER_19]: I noticed your camera's not on,
but maybe we could just put something on
[SPEAKER_19]: real quick to show people what it actually
is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, give me one second here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, because I can I can I'm not sure you
should be able to turn it on to
[SPEAKER_19]: screensaver for it, because it's always
good for people to be able to see.
[SPEAKER_19]: Elysian is one of the unique ones in a
sense in that that it it swivels.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's dripping straight down.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember the first time I saw it,
I was like, oh, I just love the fact that
[SPEAKER_19]: we're attempting innovation and it's not,
you know, like just just do it,
[SPEAKER_19]: just attempt to do something different and
always push yourself.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, for me, when no one else
was making bags, it was kind of boring.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then as everyone started to make bags,
it became more exciting.
[SPEAKER_19]: And even in the 20 years that I that we've
come out with bubble bags, I always ask
[SPEAKER_19]: people when they design something new,
like I asked when my friends started
[SPEAKER_19]: wrapping their washers in these,
you know, in these little sort of padded
[SPEAKER_19]: filters.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, why are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're like, oh, just to make it
colder.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm like, but you understand,
like four degrees is the perfect
[SPEAKER_19]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like the heads are brittle.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're breaking off.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like you don't need to make it minus
three.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's but at the same time, what we could
do is make it faster.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, how could we get more of the
resin off more efficiently as clean and
[SPEAKER_19]: make it faster?
[SPEAKER_19]: So I see the same thing with rosin press.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, how can we make it faster?
[SPEAKER_19]: Because obviously, that's the home units
are great and awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: But now it's going to be how do we make it
faster?
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you find that link, Elysian?
Ozzy?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_19]: I probably muted you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mute everyone just so you know,
if your mic's not muted, I'll end up
[SPEAKER_19]: muting it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So remember that when you go to talk next
time.
[SPEAKER_16]: Working on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we'll have a little chat.
[SPEAKER_19]: A little rosin puff.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's everyone puffing on?
[SPEAKER_19]: Puffing on some, actually, I got some
where's my bike here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was thinking of pressing from the maple
butter guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a 30% yielder.
[SPEAKER_19]: The squishes.
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like it's like someone put subpar
hash into the press.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just squishes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have my Sasquatch M1 set up here next to
the desk.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love how little it is and that I can
just have it right in my desk and you
[SPEAKER_19]: know, people, some people that haven't
seen presses think that it's rather big if
[SPEAKER_19]: they've only ever used a hair
straightener.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm like, yeah, you should try and
lift my V2 into your car and see how that
[SPEAKER_19]: goes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yes, I did carry that from my driveway
up to my office by myself, Matt and Joel.
[SPEAKER_19]: So please, that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_19]: We do what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like the big heavy units.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like the small light units.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love a unit that I can now, oh wow,
Chad thinks he's got it.
[SPEAKER_19]: One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.
[SPEAKER_19]: Wouldn't that be nice to get him into the
room and be able to tell his story of how
[SPEAKER_19]: he came up with it because we need to
hear.
[SPEAKER_19]: So let me see what he's saying.
[SPEAKER_19]: He is saying, I think I got it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a test room, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have the actual hash church link?
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, let's send him the actual hash
church link because man, wouldn't that be
[SPEAKER_19]: great to get him in here.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's always a lot of my friends live
like in the boonies, like out in the
[SPEAKER_19]: boonies where there's like no internet
connection.
[SPEAKER_19]: High pressure was in that situation,
I think.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, let's send that to him.
[SPEAKER_19]: And while Elysian is gearing up and
finding that, why don't we move over to
[SPEAKER_19]: Eric and he can tell us how he got into
this, where he came about finding his
path.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's send that to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was working at tech startups and I just
wasn't really happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just dropped it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when Colorado, you know, did
recreational here in 2014, things really
[SPEAKER_03]: started gearing up after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I jumped ship and worked at Massroots
for a while, kind of in their heyday when
[SPEAKER_03]: they were actually really making moves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a really good experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then a friend of mine, Josh,
who's the co-founder of Pure Pressure,
[SPEAKER_03]: we just hung out and he was telling me
about Rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I had taken some dabs and
was enjoying it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he started telling me, this is going
to be big.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you really want to come check
this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So went over to Pure Pressure,
saw what Ben and Josh were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just really sold me on the future
of Rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just jumped ship, started working
with Pure Pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty much been history ever
since.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love where the industry is going
and what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Rosin has enormous promise and
it's beautiful to see that there's so many
[SPEAKER_03]: different people contributing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, tons of different manufacturers,
boutique growers and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Rosin just gives people a lot of
power to make concentrates and make
[SPEAKER_03]: top-notch stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, my role at the company is
not in the engineering capacity,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, you know, we're 100% USA company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of like Ozzy was saying,
I think, you know, having companies here
[SPEAKER_03]: that are exporting cannabis technology is
really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in North America, North America is
going to be driving the Rosin industry for
[SPEAKER_03]: the rest of the world as, you know,
Germany, Spain, all these other countries
[SPEAKER_03]: start coming online and we start seeing a
lot of growth there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I love what's going on with Rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, what we do is make a
press that's really geared towards the
[SPEAKER_03]: highest quality Rosin possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, like Ozzy said, you know,
everyone's got a different take and
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone's got a different goal with their
equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So happy to answer any other questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think Ben and Josh,
since they were the founders, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they have a pretty interesting story where
Josh was an industry specialist.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was growing and blasting and tried to
get into Rosin and was pretty unhappy with
[SPEAKER_03]: the results, you know, using some of the
very early generation Rosin presses like
[SPEAKER_03]: you were discussing, not getting great
results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ben, his friend, industrial engineer,
he came to him and said, hey, can you just
[SPEAKER_03]: make me a better Rosin press?
[SPEAKER_03]: These ones from overseas just aren't
really doing it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much the story of peer
pressure and how it was born.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want to maybe show a little quick
clip or a photo of the peer pressure
[SPEAKER_19]: machine or I've got one set up here if you
want me to put it on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be easier.
[SPEAKER_19]: How to use the Pyke's Peak.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: This one's how to use the Pyke's Peak
Rosin press.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that a good one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've got if you're looking at our
YouTube channel, we've got a bunch of good
[SPEAKER_03]: videos up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much any of them will fit the bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Instagram also has a lot of good
content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got a lot of media out there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, this is to me, it's worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I know I always try to make it so
it's not a commercial, but these guys are
[SPEAKER_19]: all producing units and we can talk about
them.
[SPEAKER_19]: You still have to see them and kind of get
an idea.
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw both solvent zero as well as peer
pressure at the lift conference.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was kind of stoked on both of them
for different reasons, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: like solvent zero coming at the commercial
production, looking at things in a way
[SPEAKER_19]: where it's like, oh, I want to create
something that's got a flow and that you
[SPEAKER_19]: can really run through 30, 40 plus pounds
in a day with a single unit.
[SPEAKER_19]: But then the peer pressure guys had this
really advanced like computer screen that
[SPEAKER_19]: was measuring and keeping all the recipes
that you used.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, his reply to how to get
more out of it was to scale up.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, yeah, just scale up.
[SPEAKER_19]: You get like four of them going and you'll
have like four times as much rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was impressed with both of them for
different reasons.
[SPEAKER_19]: We might as well put this three minute how
to video on good time for everyone to get
[SPEAKER_19]: a dab in.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'll just figure it out over here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me see how I can do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not like.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, let's see what I got here.
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, I think we got it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we got it.
[SPEAKER_19]: My monitor broke recently, so now I'm
using this absolutely insane 40 inch TV as
[SPEAKER_19]: my monitor.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's it's not it's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, let's check this out real quick
and see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great suggestion.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of one of our old videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a new LCD touchscreen technology
that's in all of our new presses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it actually.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was much bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's quite a bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of the things, you know,
soil grown that you're talking with with
[SPEAKER_03]: nicotine being really, you know,
influential in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just share a little story about how
we linked up with essential extracts and
[SPEAKER_03]: nicotine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the really key features of our
press is our dual pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it lets you ramp pressure since it's
pneumatic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the essential extract guys came by,
you know, they're in Denver and they
[SPEAKER_03]: learned about us and they said,
hey, you know, another Denver company,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'd love to go check out what you guys
are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they came by and they had, you know,
some just amazing hash, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: much better hash than we were used to
seeing from, you know, most of our
[SPEAKER_03]: prospective customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're pressing it and it just kept
blowing out bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thought, you know what they say,
we love your press and we love your
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if we can't get some more
control, I don't think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to be able to use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then Ben and Josh kind of got their
heads together and came up with the idea
[SPEAKER_03]: to ramp the pressure with the toggle
switch there with the compressed air
[SPEAKER_03]: input.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, they were sold and
started using our press.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's really cool how,
you know, different needs allow people to
[SPEAKER_03]: innovate on different things, you know,
kind of like Ozzy was saying, depending on
[SPEAKER_03]: what your requirements are in your lab or
your environment, you're going to want or
[SPEAKER_03]: need different things potentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, different challenges are
always going to rise and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers are trying to come up with
the best solutions possible for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, recording data, being able
to dial in the perfect press.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's kind of what we're really
striving for more than anything,
[SPEAKER_03]: is just trying to figure out what is the
perfect press for a given material.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's the best temperature,
the least amount of time we're pressing it
[SPEAKER_03]: for, for maximum terpene and, you know,
preservation of your material itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's really what we strive
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't actually up in Canada for the
lift conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of the team was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said that they had a really good
time meeting everyone up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think the scene is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really booming in Canada and it's
really cool to see where things are going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, love to, you know, hear what everyone
else is getting into.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anyone's ever in Denver,
love to have you by the factory.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have people buy all the time,
open invite, you know, we're pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: right in the heart of Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyone that's ever interested in
coming by and taking a dab and checking us
[SPEAKER_03]: out, anytime you're in Denver,
you know, come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's LCD screen or the screen that
you, the digital screen that you had in at
[SPEAKER_19]: Lyft was much bigger for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was noticing that right away.
[SPEAKER_19]: It had some more information to on it,
but I guess Elysian, Ozzy, you wanted me
[SPEAKER_19]: to share that picture and you can send me
the link for your press right here in the
[SPEAKER_19]: chat room.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's in this particular box,
top left blue icon and very smart as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Eric, very cool that you guys are,
you know, collecting that data and
[SPEAKER_19]: creating a press with as much control as
possible rampaging up and all the
[SPEAKER_19]: additional things is just, it's
innovative, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's one more niche aspect of the
Rosin industry.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's so many different ones.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's such a new industry.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's exciting to watch it taking off here
in the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just mostly a user, but I definitely
do consult for LPs here in Canada,
[SPEAKER_19]: as well as around the world.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm always telling them about the
presses that I use and that I like.
[SPEAKER_19]: So keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_19]: Ozzy, did you want me to share that
picture?
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you there, sir?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just holding on a second here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause I can put it up on my screen,
the picture anyway, and then you can send
[SPEAKER_19]: me the link.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there is the Elysian.
[SPEAKER_19]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_13]: Looks pretty beefcake.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big are those plates?
[SPEAKER_13]: They're actually six by six.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_13]: The true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually rated for 45 tons.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that press built on a swivel so you can
bend it all the way to where it's facing
[SPEAKER_00]: straight down?
[SPEAKER_13]: Essentially you actually have some
extensions that are, are attachable or
[SPEAKER_13]: removable from the actual press.
[SPEAKER_13]: Depending on like essentially what you,
what it is that you need or how,
[SPEAKER_13]: what style is that you prefer.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, they're removable and it allows
you to actually tip the machine over.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go ahead and send another
link for another image of the actual
[SPEAKER_13]: machine tipped over.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you send that to me?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: One second here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got the first one.
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, there's obviously innovation
going on.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you imagine when we had hash church
episode 25, we, there were no machines.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember during that conversation,
it was a hair straightener world.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were all rocking hair straighteners and
a lot of large bald men were buying hair
[SPEAKER_19]: straighteners.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I remember a lot of people laughing
about pressing buds.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't hear them laughing anymore.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: It, uh, that one was a mind blower.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was, uh, you know, it gave me a new
appreciation for bud, much the way sort of
[SPEAKER_19]: vaporizing does, but being able to extract
the oil off of bud in an instant.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like what an incredible way to test packs.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're purchasing large amounts,
what an incredible way to test small
[SPEAKER_19]: packs.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're purchasing small amounts,
it's just such an incredible, I don't have
[SPEAKER_19]: to trust anything you say.
[SPEAKER_19]: I need to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll gladly buy a one gram bud before I
get my ounce or my pound or my 10 pack or
[SPEAKER_19]: my a hundred pack, whatever it is you're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_19]: Bottom line, being able to test the
percentage before you run it is some
[SPEAKER_19]: pretty baller shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a question.
Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you guys, uh,
what you guys think the, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like back in the day, all the Mexican,
you know, the Mexican cartels and people
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, that were, uh, you know,
packaging up the swag ass shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the stuff that like came wrapped
up and like seeds all squished into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the really garbage shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if when they were pressing that,
cause they use Jack setups to press that
[SPEAKER_00]: herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering maybe like if they're
laughing the whole time because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking their herb and they're smashing it
up into the press and like all the goopy
[SPEAKER_00]: residents just pouring out the sides of
the press and they're probably filling up
[SPEAKER_00]: mason jars with this shit and just like
dumping the herb off to all the Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering if you guys thought it
might be a possibility that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: making rosin before any of us knew what
rosin was the secret of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just like back in Lebanon with hash and
twisting of the bag.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure the cotton bag was oozing resin
at one point in time over a fire.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like guaranteed they were using
sledgehammers too, in a more archaic
[SPEAKER_19]: version of what you were talking about
Jamaica for years.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's where a lot of that gum comes from
the edge of these big hammers.
[SPEAKER_19]: Guaranteed there was epic rosin content
that was coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just, you know, there was no way to
popularize it.
[SPEAKER_19]: There might even been people that knew on
a small level, but it wasn't until soil
[SPEAKER_19]: grown posted that shit on Instagram and
everyone had a fucking iPhone or a Samsung
[SPEAKER_19]: in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was like, boom, millions of people
just learned about this.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just noticed that like when you,
when you squish Nug, after you're done
[SPEAKER_00]: squishing it, it normally looks like the
Mexican brick that they used to get on the
[SPEAKER_00]: East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I've even seen that shimmer
that shine outside of those bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, man, these dudes might've
been doing it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us, and like, they don't even
know what the fuck they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just laughing like, man,
this shit gets us way higher than that
[SPEAKER_00]: swag ass Nug.
[SPEAKER_19]: Or even worse in a total harsh reality.
[SPEAKER_19]: They were just tossing it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, Oh, get rid of that shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks ugly because it kind of used to
be like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like people just threw everything away
that didn't fit into the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was really a particular person that
would only, but you know, like a skunk
[SPEAKER_19]: man, Sam, that would be like, no,
no, that's the most important thing
[SPEAKER_19]: because he doesn't think the way the
market thinks.
[SPEAKER_19]: He thinks the way like a true head thinks,
which is just quality, quality,
[SPEAKER_19]: quality.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so give thanks to, to skunk man Sam
for all he's done.
[SPEAKER_19]: So why don't you, uh, do your,
uh, your rosin introduction there,
[SPEAKER_19]: a solventless mind.
[SPEAKER_19]: We are up to you right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Tell us how you got.
[SPEAKER_19]: How you, how you discovered it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, pretty much I was, uh, back in
Florida, sitting at a homie's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually scrolling through Facebook
and he came across the post on Facebook
[SPEAKER_00]: that had somebody showing that you could
squish a bud and a piece of parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's straight bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a hair straightener, squish a bud,
get a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we literally grabbed some Nugs,
went to the store, bought some parchment,
[SPEAKER_00]: took his old lady's fucking hair
straightener and we made some,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first bud I pressed, man, I was like,
wow, this just made instant dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is like literally you went from
nothing to something, no purge,
[SPEAKER_00]: no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can take a dab right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pretty much opened my eyes to a lot
of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I moved to California,
I started making bubble hash, had access
[SPEAKER_00]: to material being in Humboldt County and
the bubble hash wasn't the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like fucking Phil was saying,
like half melt garbage most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was taking that stuff and I
literally, like for one event I used a
[SPEAKER_00]: hair straightener and I crushed out a
quarter pound of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a quarter pound with my foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Using my foot, sticking it underneath my
foot, stamping on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time I was done with that,
I realized that the event the next day
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could barely walk, like I was
having trouble walking and my ass cheek
[SPEAKER_00]: was locking up on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My thigh was, I was getting like spasms
from all this pressing I did the night
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I was like, all right,
there's gotta be a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you guys did the hash church and you
guys showed the t-shirt press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, man, I'd much rather be,
you know, smashing my hand down and like
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing the press down and like stopping
my foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was before people were using clamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like stopping my foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were using their elbows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the t-shirt press definitely took it to
the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course the Sasquatch rosin
press, the V1, when I bought that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fucking stoked, even though I had to
put the plates together to keep them,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I produce a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the only thing that I didn't like
about that press was the fact that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: to put the plates together because I
couldn't produce every like five or 10
[SPEAKER_00]: presses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed I had to put the plates back
together, warm it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise I wasn't getting the same
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, that's like,
like the history for me, man, like from
[SPEAKER_00]: the foot, like back in Florida,
all the way to the point where look now
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got the V2, the 2.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like literally, I don't know,
man, I can do crazy presses now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I turn the work I used to take like
days to do in the hours.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, dude, I'll tell you, you just made
me really laugh when you talked about the
[SPEAKER_19]: injury that you got, because both D420K
and I both got injured making rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: Fucking, I did my neck in so bad,
it hurt for weeks.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was fucking squeezing that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like, oh, I just got to get every
last drop out of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So my hats off to the innovators and the
makers of the rosin presses, because holy
[SPEAKER_19]: shit, dude, hurting yourself making rosin
got old fast.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know your pain, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you're not talking some light shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: You were probably damn near crippled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I was fucking hurting, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was crippled, like you're saying,
walking around the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, man, what the fuck is wrong with
me?
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole night I'm taking fucking,
or taking a little hashback and putting
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the papers, sticking them in the
air straightener, standing up on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: squatting back down, all the squatting up
and down all fucking night and stepping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked myself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I still don't even know if that
was soil groans post or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I was late to the fucking
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've even been a post that soil
grown made that was on Facebook that
[SPEAKER_00]: someone shared in one of the groups or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really sure, but I'm doubting it
was anybody but him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, yeah, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously, once we got ahold of it,
it spread so fast, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: It wasn't like this bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_19]: It really went like this.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, like at one point in time with
Jeff Church and Johnny B and Ramo and Don
[SPEAKER_19]: and Aaron from DNA.
[SPEAKER_19]: And like, there was a whole bunch of
people.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think Ramon was there and True
Cannibalist and Flav421, all of them for
[SPEAKER_19]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Great gardener watching with a tiny little
$10 hair straightener like the one that's
[SPEAKER_19]: as thick as your finger.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're wrapping like a half gram of barb
and just like melting that shit into like
[SPEAKER_19]: the most golden translucent, like six star
bubble hash or dry sift even.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's some of the first shit that all of
those guys saw pressed, which,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, of course it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: But still, what an incredible group of
people to have around you while,
[SPEAKER_19]: hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_19]: We have something to show you.
[SPEAKER_19]: And none of them had seen it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like they'd heard about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like, yeah, I heard some guy on
Instagram smashing nugs or whatever,
[SPEAKER_19]: but I haven't really seen it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, wow, you need to see it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was at Spannibus like 20.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_19]: Would it have been 2013 or 14?
[SPEAKER_14]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_19]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: The excitement was real.
[SPEAKER_19]: Two years.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: It devolved fucking quick, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is really crazy.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess we're up to honey butter.
[SPEAKER_19]: We want to hear from you, dude,
how you got into this, where you heard
[SPEAKER_19]: about it and how your passions led you
into it and how the fuck you make such
[SPEAKER_19]: awesome big giant balls of rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I'll be sending you my PO box
later for, no, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you're on mute.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got 854 people waiting to hear what
you have to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got into rosin about just a little
over a year ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't really a heavy dapper before I
found out about rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it just ruined my day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dabbing ruined my day.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I dabbed in the morning, I was,
I mean, I was done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was at the Healing Harvest Fest up
in Laytonville a little over a year ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw a Pesbro rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, it's a cool logo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this stuff's really bright colored.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they talked me into a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just floored.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, wait, you can make something
that tastes this good and there's no
[SPEAKER_05]: chemicals involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was, it just became my mission.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to learn more about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just kind of hopped right in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was also new to Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw a soil grown and solventless
mine, two turnt to skirt, and a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: other guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just like, you know,
the little blackish green stuff that ran
[SPEAKER_05]: out of my hair straightener was not like
what I was seeing online.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just, you know, what do I got to
do to produce, to get this result?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just been my mission since,
just practice, practice, practice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ruined a lot of pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasted a lot of time in the car and on the
washing machine, running shitty material,
[SPEAKER_05]: realizing that you have to run,
you have to have a great starting
[SPEAKER_05]: material.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, that's the main metric to it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And see, and how, how did you learn that?
[SPEAKER_19]: You learned that by having not great
starting material.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's what people should not be
afraid to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I put up some of your work for everyone
to see while you're talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cube.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make a giant one, but it's,
you know, it's, it's such a labor of love
[SPEAKER_05]: that having that much rosin around at
once, it's just, you know, you don't want
[SPEAKER_05]: it to go bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to oxidize.
[SPEAKER_05]: About quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I get a lot of questions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the main thing I just want to tell
people is like, just, you can save
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself a lot of hassle if you just
source really good material, but you're
[SPEAKER_05]: also going to like be in tears when you
ruin that good material.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it is important to kind of work
your way up just kind of like coming from
[SPEAKER_05]: the culinary industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I started out in delis and
pizzerias and then I went to golf courses
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I finally got like a bistro job
and then finally into fine dining and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to develop the skillset and the
respect and also learn a lot from your
[SPEAKER_05]: peers.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people who are doing this way
better than you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's something to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you can't just expect to hop in
and make a result.
[SPEAKER_05]: And realizing, you know, how much work
that everybody's put into this craft is
[SPEAKER_05]: it's really cool that just, you know,
this day and age of Instagram,
[SPEAKER_05]: that you have this resource right at your
fingertips.
[SPEAKER_05]: And more often than not, if you're
respectful, people are willing to answer
[SPEAKER_05]: your questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, everybody on this panel has
probably got DMs from me from a year ago
[SPEAKER_05]: asking the stupidest fucking questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So don't be afraid to ask the stupid
questions and don't be afraid to receive
[SPEAKER_19]: the answer.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not the answer you think you're
going to get from your stupid question
[SPEAKER_19]: because your reaction to the stoop when
someone replies to your stupid question,
[SPEAKER_19]: it might not be the way you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I guarantee you there's gold nuggets
in there nonetheless, even though it might
[SPEAKER_19]: be hard to read.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also might not be what you want to
hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you might if you only have a
limited view of your method and your
[SPEAKER_05]: technique, you just you haven't literally
done enough squishes and opens your mind
[SPEAKER_05]: to just different perspectives of it to
unlock what it is that you're seeking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I squished a lot of,
you know, two, three star bubble hash
[SPEAKER_05]: about a year ago and most of the spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when we started growing with the
express intent of squishing everything
[SPEAKER_05]: that we grow, it started to cleft.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first time liked up last year was
was tough because, you know, I finally
[SPEAKER_05]: grew a good crop of weed for once in my
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I was about to offer it all up to
the rosin press.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it came out OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: But after having a second crop last year
and everything I learned from the first
[SPEAKER_05]: one and just kind of hopping right back
into processing after the full season crop
[SPEAKER_05]: was just it was cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned more in the last three months
than I did in the previous year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I just feel I'm at a level where
I'm more receptive to learning.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've really only been doing this
a short time, but I'm very passionate
[SPEAKER_05]: about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what were some of your revelations,
you know, not to go too into detail,
[SPEAKER_19]: but just to give us a little bit of an
idea, some of the things that were learned
[SPEAKER_19]: from the first crop versus the second
crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Executing a faster press when pressing
flour in the first crop, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was letting my material warm up too
long.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't bringing the plates down far
enough and I was getting a darker color.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also where the rosin would be in
between the parchment in between the
[SPEAKER_05]: plates, I would notice that it had this
kind of cooked effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started thinking, well, I want to
get this stuff just warm enough and loose
[SPEAKER_05]: enough and then get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, you could do that at a low
temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do that at a high temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all experimentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every material is different as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's, you know, even with such a tip
that you just gave, it's still required to
[SPEAKER_19]: do all the work.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not like the tip's going to save you
doing all the work and learning the
[SPEAKER_19]: material.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, dry sifting and wet washing is
not too different.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's different types of resins.
[SPEAKER_19]: They all react differently.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you pay attention to those subtle,
subtle differences, you can just you can
[SPEAKER_19]: have advantages because a lot of people
just aren't paying the same amount of
[SPEAKER_19]: attention.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think everyone's got the ability.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just it's always I always gravitate
towards people such as yourselves on the
[SPEAKER_19]: panel that are doing it at a high
excellence, a high rate of excellence that
[SPEAKER_19]: it's it's people are all you guys are
really doing is a you're paying more
[SPEAKER_19]: attention than the average person.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're paying attention to the material
that you're even bothering running.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when you run that material,
you're actually paying attention to the
[SPEAKER_19]: temperature of your plates and the PSI and
the materials being used in the times.
[SPEAKER_19]: And these are things that if you just kind
of act a little laissez faire about,
[SPEAKER_19]: you're not going to get the same results.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_19]: Each little thing that you make a mistake
along the way, you can end up with a sort
[SPEAKER_19]: of darker, less desirable, less terpy
material.
[SPEAKER_19]: I personally never pressed any burnt
popcorn, but I did see it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like, wow, that is definitely I
kind of got the idea while these oil guys
[SPEAKER_19]: were like, oh, rosin, it's just all burnt
popcorn.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's because the first time they tried it,
they did it so terribly poor, probably the
[SPEAKER_19]: same way they make oil that they ended up
with this very low quality rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like, man, I'm not seeing that
at all.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, I don't see that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I see like beautiful, beautiful shit that,
you know, looks just like the photos
[SPEAKER_19]: behind me on my wall.
[SPEAKER_19]: Super quality, super turp rich grabs me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm coughing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just don't see the reality that that the
heat is destroying all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, obviously it must be volatizing
some, but maybe the most volatile ones are
[SPEAKER_19]: the harshest ones.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why we've always cured them out
of our bud before we smoked, because
[SPEAKER_19]: they're not super enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that as I get older, I want less
to do with those super caustic volatile
[SPEAKER_19]: early terpenes and terpenoids that usually
are the ones that would cure out in your
[SPEAKER_19]: curing process.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess next up we got Lindsay from the
Gorilla Rosin Press, fellow Canadian in
[SPEAKER_19]: the house.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to give us, give a little
explanation as to how you got into this
[SPEAKER_19]: Lindsay?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're also on a phone.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now you're unmuted.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I can't hear you again.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_19]: I heard him say, of course I muted myself,
but now I don't hear him.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe the mic underneath is blocked.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes I actually sent out an etiquette
in regards to don't come in on a phone,
[SPEAKER_19]: mainly because it shakes the screen really
bad.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of motion and honestly,
phones cause more problems than they
[SPEAKER_19]: don't.
[SPEAKER_19]: Usually if there's a technical difficulty,
it'll be because you're in on a phone.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe try to figure that out, come back
in.
[SPEAKER_19]: Come back in on a computer if you've got
one.
[SPEAKER_19]: We definitely want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, there you are.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, how close was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of got your link this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've sort of been following everybody
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got into cannabis when I was 14 years
old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually smoking joints are blocked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember in college, taking chemistry
class, we'd grab some of the equipment and
[SPEAKER_04]: four or five of us would go and make VHL
at night.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've always kind of delved into
different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: My background is manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I first saw people making rosin,
I think I saw it on Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_04]: An early episode of Hashtag Church and
then read about it in high times.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started following Sasquatch and guys
like Elisha.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, you know, nobody's doing
this in Canada and nobody's making
[SPEAKER_04]: presses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I put my first press together with the
Canadian Tire Shop Press and some plates I
[SPEAKER_04]: got off online.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I thought, you know, we can do
better than this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The heat distribution and pressure
distribution just wasn't good enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hired a few friends that are
professional engineers and we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: through three prototypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started at the beginning of 2017 and we
launched in October with our final
[SPEAKER_04]: prototype, which is made with special
alloy castings and has a very open concept
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's a bunch of things we want
to add to our press in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now we're working on, we source
pressure transducers and electric motors
[SPEAKER_04]: for our power team hydraulic rams.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're looking at automating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But up to now it's been a hand pump,
which is, I still feel the best way to
[SPEAKER_04]: press rosin just because you get that
feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see it and you can just get on top of
it when it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just feel you get the highest
quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at Lyft, people were asking about
automating it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we already had, we started,
we never used a PID.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started with the industrial controller
from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can automate this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I envision, you know,
robots feeding this thing in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rosin bots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sort of, that's sort of like the
way I've always envisioned making a press.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we made it open concept
from day one, just so you can access it
[SPEAKER_04]: from front or back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's sort of my story.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, and where can they go look at the
gorilla press?
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have like a photo that you can put
up on the screen or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll put it on the screen here in a
little bit where my logo was.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can, I'm evolved underscore
cannabis on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you sent me a picture even
actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: I did, you sent me pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you sent you an email the other
day with a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So here I'll just put it up real quick
just so people can get an idea.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's nice to be able to see once what
you're actually talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_19]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the open concept.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can kind of see a little bit of it
actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: I might have to make it a little smaller.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it doesn't fit any better.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can put it at all the different angles
and it's got a good digital readout screen
[SPEAKER_19]: on there as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Who'd have thought that it would start to
get so like, like from a hair straightener
[SPEAKER_19]: to a t-shirt press to like, you know,
the hand pump Sasquatch M1 to like the
[SPEAKER_19]: peer pressure dual button.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like it's pretty incredible what all of
these all the different innovations that
[SPEAKER_19]: you guys are offering.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's, it's unique as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just like Eric was kind of saying,
you know, the manufacturers can kind of
[SPEAKER_19]: fix the problem for specific groups of
people because you know, certain people
[SPEAKER_19]: will grow resin that might be attuned to
them.
[SPEAKER_19]: It will be specific to them, especially if
they live in a place like Colorado where
[SPEAKER_19]: the moisture content is super low.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I want to get into that conversation
once the rest of the panel has introduced
[SPEAKER_19]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_19]: Which we'll get right to, but I do want to
get into the discussion of like awesome
[SPEAKER_19]: preservation when you're making hundreds
of grams at a time, the best way for us to
[SPEAKER_19]: go about preserving it in the different
environments that we are, because
[SPEAKER_19]: preserving in Eugene, Oregon is not going
to be the same as preserving in Denver,
[SPEAKER_19]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just a lot of moisture content that can
change things up and help things butter
[SPEAKER_19]: out.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know bubble hash is that way for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess, I think Matt just turned his
camera off, but I was going to get Matt
[SPEAKER_19]: from solvent zero to introduce himself.
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you there, Matt?
[SPEAKER_19]: Or did you have to go?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm here guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_19]: So Matt is another person I met at Lyft
and he had a big commercial unit that
[SPEAKER_19]: struck my eye.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, Oh, here's like, you know,
like definitely an obvious thing that's
[SPEAKER_19]: going to an obvious niche in the industry
that will, the whole industry is
[SPEAKER_19]: commercializing regardless, even if of
course, you can take as many Sasquatches
[SPEAKER_19]: or peer pressures and, and, and go large.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's always going to be companies that
would just rather get fewer units and,
[SPEAKER_19]: and, and go really large.
[SPEAKER_19]: So he had that industrial commercial
version of a Rosin press.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'll let you introduce yourself,
Matt, and tell us, you know, how you came
[SPEAKER_19]: to be, how you came towards the cannabis
and then into extracts and then into
[SPEAKER_19]: designing or becoming a part of solvent
zero.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, yeah, first off, just want to say
thank you for having me on props to all of
[SPEAKER_12]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, Sasquatch soil growing solvent was
mine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, yeah, I've been following all of you
guys for years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically the inspiration came from,
um, some really good friends of mine who,
[SPEAKER_12]: who brought this product to me years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, inspiration came from them and came
from all of you guys really.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but, uh, yeah, so first of all,
my friend brought this product to me years
[SPEAKER_12]: ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: I grew up in, uh, BC, Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I've, I've seen the industry,
you know, and seen it evolve to what it is
[SPEAKER_12]: today.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's still, still evolving.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so basically, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, my friend brought this product to me
years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I was extremely impressed with,
you know, what it was, how premium it was
[SPEAKER_12]: the Terps.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just better than anything I'd seen.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, you know, it was almost too good
to be true.
[SPEAKER_12]: I couldn't really believe that it was just
heat and pressure that was producing this
[SPEAKER_12]: type of product.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so the only thing I just, you know,
I saw what it took for him to,
[SPEAKER_12]: to produce it and how long it took,
the time it took to prepare.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and so that's sort of how solvent zero
was born.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, years ago, we just decided to figure
out a way to produce this stuff faster,
[SPEAKER_12]: easier, cheaper.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we kind of saw what's happening with
the regulations in Canada and how
[SPEAKER_12]: everything is going recreational.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and basically, you know, CO2 oil was
kind of taking over because it was one of
[SPEAKER_12]: the only methods that's approved by the
government.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, um, that was sort of taking over
with the commercial production of,
[SPEAKER_12]: of extracts.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, I saw Rosin really being the
future, um, you know, of extracts,
[SPEAKER_12]: if, if there was some way to produce it
really quick.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just decided to start building this
machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and that's basically how, how this all
came about.
[SPEAKER_19]: So when you say years ago, cause soil
grown was saying it was 2015 that he
[SPEAKER_19]: posted that on Instagram, like how many
years ago could it have been like two?
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was showing Rosin about three,
three and a half years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then about two, yeah, I was about two
years ago when we decided to, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: come out with a machine that could do this
on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_19]: I often sometimes think when we have these
memories, I don't know the history as well
[SPEAKER_19]: for Rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just kind of paying attention like a
mild historian, but for my own water hash
[SPEAKER_19]: history, I know the history extremely
well.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's often people will be like,
Oh yeah, I was making water hash 25 years
[SPEAKER_19]: ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, no, probably like 18 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, it was like 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, I don't think it's probably not
like it's, it's possible, but just because
[SPEAKER_19]: really, I mean, Rosin was an existing
method that it was on IC mag, but very,
[SPEAKER_19]: very, very, very different from the
pressure and the heat that soil grown when
[SPEAKER_19]: he released the Rosin Kraken on Instagram
in 2015, that shit right there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't believe it's only been that long
really.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like when I think of all the different
like technologies that have come out of it
[SPEAKER_19]: and all the conversations, it's really
quite something.
[SPEAKER_19]: It blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like to show your unit.
[SPEAKER_19]: Should I go on the website or should I?
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause it's a, it's a big unit.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a, let me see if I can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fully, fully hydraulic.
[SPEAKER_12]: So everything is from a touch of the
button.
[SPEAKER_12]: We did add a, like a controlled down speed
feature.
[SPEAKER_12]: So with the touch of a button,
you can bring the plate down little by
[SPEAKER_12]: little, and it's very touchy control.
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically you can bring the plates down
right till they hit the bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can give it a tiny little bit of
pressure.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they heat up, they expand a little bit,
and then you can hit it with the full
[SPEAKER_12]: pressure all from a touch of a button.
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been crucial.
[SPEAKER_12]: That feature is crucial for preventing the
blowouts.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, basically we're just trying to
figure out how to, you know, get these out
[SPEAKER_12]: to all the LPs and, and, and just spread,
spread the rosin word and, and,
[SPEAKER_12]: and get it out there because we see it
being the future really of, of extracts.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a fucking terminator machine,
dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: When I just turned the video on and the
sound came on, it was like, oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_17]: it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love the fact that it's such a young
industry and that you guys all have such a
[SPEAKER_19]: strong place by just, you know,
all of the different presses there's,
[SPEAKER_19]: you just have little different niches
almost, you know, like I could,
[SPEAKER_19]: I see great success in all of your
futures, as long as you, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: maintain innovation, follow your passion
and obviously try to make it so even the
[SPEAKER_19]: commercial people can produce the highest
quality as possible, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: to really be able to control the pressure
and the, and the heat.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the time that seems to be the trio for
rosin that makes a great product.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a, I'm sure a lot of people are
going to be squishing a lot of product
[SPEAKER_19]: after this.
[SPEAKER_19]: I do, once we get finished up with Matt
and Joel from Sasquatch, which are next up
[SPEAKER_19]: to bat, I'd like to get into a good
conversation where we actually start
[SPEAKER_19]: talking about methods that we make,
you know, like I just wanted you guys to
[SPEAKER_19]: be able to all do introductions,
introduce your Instagrams and your
[SPEAKER_19]: companies and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_19]: So people had a kind of an idea where each
of you were coming from.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we could get into a really great
discussion.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've only been going for an hour and 17
minutes.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we still have time for a really great
rosin conversation.
[SPEAKER_19]: And in the meantime, thank you,
Matt from Solvent Zero for sharing that
[SPEAKER_19]: with us.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we'll move right over to Sir Joel and
Sir Matt in the funky Sasquatch rosin
[SPEAKER_19]: office.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's up, boys?
[SPEAKER_19]: Unmute yourselves.
[SPEAKER_19]: I muted everyone.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just like, Oh, there we go.
Welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: How is everybody?
[SPEAKER_19]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a long time coming to do Hash Church
2.0, the past, present and future of
[SPEAKER_19]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: So right now we're in the present of rosin
and you guys are very much a part of the
[SPEAKER_19]: present of rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: So tell us, tell us how solvent or
Sasquatch rosin press came to be and how
[SPEAKER_19]: you guys found your passion in,
in producing these presses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I guess it was, it was after Hash
Church really when, uh, when Swirlgrom was
[SPEAKER_08]: on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Swirlgrom's our cousin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, after that, my, my brother had,
you know, he had introduced me to the
[SPEAKER_08]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, Holy shit, what's,
what's he doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I didn't even know he was doing
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I was honestly, I was honestly in the
Hills growing weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did that for six, seven years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was making PHO to be honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really, really good at making PHO.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I had a passive little oil itself
and we finished and I was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: fuck yeah, let's do this, make it happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, so I just got tired of growing
really, and kind of hit it.
[SPEAKER_08]: My cousin Joel here is kind of like an
engineer type, did it well and good at,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, building things, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I'm semi good at it, but didn't do it
for a living.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, I grew weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so when I contacted Joel, he was like,
fuck yeah, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, we need to build a press that
can actually,
[SPEAKER_09]: sorry guys, Joel's Mike's not coming
through.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably got to speak up louder.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it wasn't coming through almost at
all.
[SPEAKER_19]: Unless you can hold it right up to your
mouth for a second and do a test.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that, that works totally actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might've been the beard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I had almost died at, uh,
at work the week before.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a wastewater plant and, um,
we had already talked about, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: obviously Phil's our cousin.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had showed us rosin, blew my mind up,
never smoked PHO at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It gave me kind of like a lung spasm every
time I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it didn't ever really work for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was telling everybody they're
poisoning themselves and don't smoke PHOs
[SPEAKER_08]: and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, big ups to Phil.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, a lot, a lot of things happen by
accident, you know, but, uh, I don't think
[SPEAKER_08]: there's ever not a reason why they,
they happened in that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, um, as far as the Sasquatch
started, I think the combination of that
[SPEAKER_07]: moves that up and moves that up with what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was over the Christmas break.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we, we built a couple of press
and I think all we had was a grinder and a
[SPEAKER_07]: 2015 grinder.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they worked hella good.
[SPEAKER_08]: We ended up building 20 presses there,
sold them all at the first high time show
[SPEAKER_08]: that we ever did.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after like, holy shit,
like we needed to build 50 or 200 of these
[SPEAKER_08]: things in this tiny little garage.
[SPEAKER_08]: From there, we instantly like instantly
got a big place and we started building
[SPEAKER_08]: hundreds of them and teaching everybody
how to press, you know, an ounce at a
[SPEAKER_08]: time, two ounces at a time, get production
done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause at first, no one was really pressing
ounces or pressing even a quarter ounce,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, like it was really small time,
small scale stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, D-nail presses and t-shirt
presses like stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe a couple, a couple of presses of
really, really tiny plates to press small
[SPEAKER_08]: amounts of hash, maybe like a gram or two
at a time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were like, fuck, we need to press,
you know, ounces, two, three ounces,
[SPEAKER_08]: four ounces.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now really with the 2.5, you can get work
done super, super fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Depending on what you're not afraid to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a nice bud.
[SPEAKER_08]: You gonna squish that?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a little bit of where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to come back out to Canada for some.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_19]: The last time you were here, we squished a
bunch of this and got like 29 point
[SPEAKER_19]: something percent return.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was tight.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, pretty much born off of me being
tired of going to work and the passion for
[SPEAKER_08]: wanting to be healthier.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, honestly, I stopped eating meat.
[SPEAKER_08]: I stopped doing all sorts of shit that I
was doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I started focusing more on a health
type craze and like being nice to my body.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Roslyn really clicked in my head like,
yes, like we need to tell the world,
[SPEAKER_08]: the whole entire world needs to know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the last two and a half years,
it's been my mission, my life's mission to
[SPEAKER_08]: run around and tell everybody I've seen
know about Roslyn not to smoke VHO.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I've had personal friends
blow themselves up, burn their houses
[SPEAKER_08]: down.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, me personally never happened to
me, but I made that shit for six to seven
[SPEAKER_08]: years.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, notice how much damage I did to
my body, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So be safe, really.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's that's what we're our whole thing
is to be safe and healthy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, well, I mean, the most dangerous
thing you can do with one of these presses
[SPEAKER_19]: is drop it on your foot.
[SPEAKER_19]: As long as you avoid doing that,
you should be good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, don't be me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bro, break your big toe.
[SPEAKER_19]: My God, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: These guys came out, their whole crew came
out to Jamaica last year for Bob Marley's
[SPEAKER_19]: birthday.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a booth with our Jamaican company,
Cannabinoid Research and Development,
[SPEAKER_19]: and Sasquatch was there with us.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a press.
[SPEAKER_19]: We ended up dabbing out a bunch of the
Marley's.
[SPEAKER_19]: We met the prime minister of the country.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was it was a pretty sweet experience
all in all.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to actually try and go at the
end of the month at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_19]: February for this weekend.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I just can't wait.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't miss it, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's too special.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just moved into our new stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know that at all.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell everyone about the Good Vibes charity
event.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, I just had an idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: My I have a couple of friends that have
autistic children and I've recently become
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty good friends with Jinx Proof
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously, he runs northwest as an
autistic child himself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I figured, like, you know, we need to
give back to the community and kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: show the community that our community is
doing good things and we want to provide
[SPEAKER_08]: and be a part.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to mix our community with their
community and be one together and not
[SPEAKER_08]: judge each other or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of just.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also want to obviously raise money for
children and families in need.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not doing it to make profits or
anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all crowdfunded.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we're going to have a great
time, rosin competition, USA Squash Off.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a whole bunch of things going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can go on forever.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, February 3rd with the old
Sasquatch Factory.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome, dude, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll put the link up in the in the
comments section of the YouTube video once
[SPEAKER_19]: it gets uploaded as well, because that's
just a good thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously, we should know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we can't make it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're accepting donations just
because, you know, we'd love to raise
[SPEAKER_08]: almost 20 grand to donate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're already at like almost $12,000.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm pretty sure that we're going to get
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We still got a couple more weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after the show, we're going to
have silent auctions and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff to raise more money.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it would be awesome for anyone who can
come.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to do a silent auction,
did you say?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wants to put anything on the table.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll send some stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll send some stuff down, dude,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put a base price of what you think
it's worth and what you think it should
[SPEAKER_08]: get.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you always have to remind people
when it's an auction that you're not
[SPEAKER_19]: actually trying to get it for cheaper than
it costs.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to pay more than what it costs
because you're raising money for autistic
[SPEAKER_19]: children.
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Trying to grind the price down.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have speakers coming out to talk
about how cannabis use is helping autistic
[SPEAKER_08]: children.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of a trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Autism Society of San Diego has been
with the company for 52 plus years.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've also used cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: They use cannabis on their patients as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I tripped out because the owner or
whatever I've been in contact with her and
[SPEAKER_08]: she's like, yeah, we use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, well, I thought I was
going to offend you by even saying our
[SPEAKER_08]: show is based around it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really cool to see how much it's
changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So what's the link where they can go and
donate?
[SPEAKER_08]: I can put it up in the thing right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a really long link.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Put it in the chat and then I'll paste it
into the other chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: My Instagram bio as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know how lazy people are.
[SPEAKER_19]: They want the link right there.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got to deliver that shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, that's everyone that's gone
through.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've started with soil grown and we went
through the whole list of everyone.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think really we've got 814 people
watching live right now and now we're into
[SPEAKER_19]: the show.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I guess it's really about the presence
and it's all about making rosin and
[SPEAKER_19]: preserving rosin and finding the best
material that you can.
[SPEAKER_19]: So let's start at the start.
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously your tools and the quality of
material that you're going to find.
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyone want to kind of go off on how they
went about finding the quality tool as
[SPEAKER_19]: well as the quality material?
[SPEAKER_19]: Not always so easy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Links up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, the link.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_19]: Here I'll put that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep up the good work too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to let all the other rosin
press companies know like it's awesome to
[SPEAKER_08]: see the innovation.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, at first no one was around.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we were the first ones out there
really teaching people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there was like the rosin
technologies press that was out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome little press, the Dino press,
but like they weren't teaching people and
[SPEAKER_08]: that was like one thing I saw was like,
whoa, are they not allowed to press at
[SPEAKER_08]: shows?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or we just didn't really care.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just went out there and we just started
pressing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't even think about the rules at
all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we're just like, let's teach
everybody like everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: but yeah, it's awesome to see the
innovation and growth, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to see what the future is.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the people who decide to say,
let's just teach everything that really
[SPEAKER_19]: make it so a bunch more people can come
innovate, stand on the shoulders of those
[SPEAKER_19]: giants and take it to that next level.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you don't kind of share for people
to innovate, I mean, it's exactly how
[SPEAKER_19]: bubble bags was started.
[SPEAKER_19]: If I didn't teach people how to use those
bags, well, I was not going to be selling
[SPEAKER_19]: any bags, especially because you think
rosin tripped people out.
[SPEAKER_19]: People used to laugh in my face about
waterhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washing the weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: They thought it was the most ridiculous
thing that you could possibly do.
[SPEAKER_19]: Putting herb, beautiful herb into water
and ice back in like 1998.
[SPEAKER_19]: 1999.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm telling you, this is, this is a time
where people threw away trim by the metric
[SPEAKER_19]: ton.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like literally just, this was the sound of
trim getting dumped.
[SPEAKER_19]: Beep, beep, beep.
[SPEAKER_19]: The giant truck backing up.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd be like, Oh, what did you do with that
metric ton of trim that you had?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, Oh, I got rid of it,
man.
[SPEAKER_19]: I threw that shit out.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know, as I started the bubble bag
company, that shit changed in a hurry
[SPEAKER_19]: because people realized these mountains of
trim were like, they were just such an
[SPEAKER_19]: incredible value, you know, especially if
you hit it with some good trim,
[SPEAKER_19]: not just some swaggy, swaggy subpar
material, but, and I, I'll say some of the
[SPEAKER_19]: first full melt I ever made was made from
trim really tight to the bud trim that
[SPEAKER_19]: produced, you know, five and six star
quality bubble hash that melted into a
[SPEAKER_19]: liquid and looked like stained glass
window.
[SPEAKER_19]: When I held it up to the sun, it's a,
it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: So how do you guys go about finding your
good material, solventless bud and two
[SPEAKER_19]: turnt and honey butter?
[SPEAKER_05]: Easiest solution would be to grow it
yourself, but that's not always an option.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's got to be in the loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to know the right people and know,
know where your stuff comes from.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a, it's not really like a,
you know, what am I going to find this
[SPEAKER_05]: week kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more like, you know, you have a few,
a few people that you want to just stay in
[SPEAKER_05]: contact with and see, you know,
see if they'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it even starts before that in a sense,
because some people really, what if you
[SPEAKER_19]: don't know what quality herb even is?
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, for me, I always said the bags
were the one of God, run it through the
[SPEAKER_19]: bags.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if it comes out looking like this,
then you have incredible quality material,
[SPEAKER_19]: because I just noticed most people,
their ability to perceive was below that
[SPEAKER_19]: level of being able to understand that
this was great or something.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I just saw a lot of people,
I don't know if it was a cognitive
[SPEAKER_19]: dissonance or if they had just never
really seen what I was considering
[SPEAKER_19]: quality.
[SPEAKER_19]: They would think like a three star back in
the day was good and everyone's bubble.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like for me, my company would have been
way more successful if more people grew
[SPEAKER_19]: great herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say that much.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to run around with a trim bin,
a hair straightener and a couple rosin
[SPEAKER_05]: bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would, you know, I was going to go
look at some material.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was just, you know, last winter and I
would shake a little out and press it
[SPEAKER_05]: right there on the spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was one way to tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I realized eventually was there's
not much good material out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're putting yourself at the mercy of
what you can find at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're probably not going to get
above a three, four star end product.
[SPEAKER_18]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would add to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you're probably not going to get
it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, he's got the YouTube video and I'll
just mute him.
[SPEAKER_19]: What I was going to say in regards to that
was that I used to do a similar thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I wasn't really testing for the quality of
the resin for me back in the day.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had to I had to test for sulfur because
everyone in the Pacific Northwest grows
[SPEAKER_19]: powdery mildew like you wouldn't fucking
believe.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so they would eventually, especially
in the 90s, it's a lot better now that we
[SPEAKER_19]: concentrate world.
[SPEAKER_19]: But they would they would use sulfur
burners.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that people are like,
oh, use a sulfur burner and veg and it's
[SPEAKER_19]: fine.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I've macro photographed many of veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can promise you that trichomes are
already on the plant from the first set of
[SPEAKER_19]: two true leaves, not the caudalodon,
the round ones, but the next set,
[SPEAKER_19]: which is the epicodal, the first two true
set of leaves that come out of a seedling.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have photographed with my macro camera
trichomes present on those leaves.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you're worried about those
oleoresins becoming contaminated with
[SPEAKER_19]: sulfur, which is what happens when you use
a sulfur burner, then you should be you
[SPEAKER_19]: should be worried about it even in
vegetative.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was religious about not wanting it in
my product.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I would do is I take a small pinch
of material and with a lighter,
[SPEAKER_19]: I would light the end of it, close my eyes
and just hold the smoke under my nose
[SPEAKER_19]: gently.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if it smelled anything like a pack of
matches or a single burnt match,
[SPEAKER_19]: that shit was like gone.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I'll tell you, not only would it
contaminate your resin and make your resin
[SPEAKER_19]: literally taste like matches, it would
also fuck up your bags, which,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, they're not cheap.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're an expensive tool.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you you don't want to be soaking
them with this sulfur material that just
[SPEAKER_19]: never seems to disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little something on what you said
about how do we go about finding good
[SPEAKER_00]: material?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty much working with growers
that listen and actually give a shit about
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing, because a lot of
growers have it in their mind that they
[SPEAKER_00]: already know that they're growing the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you watch their stuff,
or you squish their stuff, the results
[SPEAKER_00]: don't show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you'll get flour that looks really
frosty, frosty is all hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you try to squish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get 8%, 11% back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're going to tell the grower,
yo, I can't press the rest of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I do, it's work less than the
god just sitting here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to take that loss?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they'll say, yeah, they want it
just for headstache.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I got to sit here now and go
through the agony of pressing this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's giving me nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you talk to the grower,
they don't want to hear that their butt's
[SPEAKER_00]: not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like the good material comes
with the growers that actually listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the extractors or the hash makers,
because we do know resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand dry, we understand char,
we understand melt, we understand lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that they don't necessarily
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just understand the plant and not
really the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when we're extracting,
we get a whole different sight from a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole different view.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually seeing just the resin just
by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a grower's growing in hotter
climates, he might have thicker wax
[SPEAKER_00]: membranes and have charry-ass hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a guy's growing in cooler climates,
he might have the meltiest shit ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of shit that decides
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just hot, cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything that goes into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a difference between growers
who grow dry resin and growers that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the grease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go to put it into your press
to make rosin, you don't press them the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do, you're just not doing it
right, in my opinion, because the greases,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can drop the temp and you can get that
shit to flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the dry resins, the shit that's like
the Tangies, the Blue Dream, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: certain varieties that when you put them
in there and you try to press them low,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't even rosin out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're literally just building up a
butter, just chunk around the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your percentages drop like a used
condom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at like, it could have been
80%, but now it's like 40% because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got nothing out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you've got to explain to the
grower, the money has to go up or down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how people do their pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all on what the yield is compared to
what the herb would have sold for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you have to explain to the grower,
as long as the grower is willing to listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to you and hear you out on everything that
you're saying, then you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the greatest material you can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the stubborn guys, they're always
going to give you the bits, always.
[SPEAKER_19]: Ain't that the truth?
[SPEAKER_19]: The stubborn guys got stuck with the mids.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't get stuck with mids.
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen to your extractor.
[SPEAKER_19]: I see the exact same relationship,
to be honest, in a lot of the rosin press
[SPEAKER_19]: companies where you have a ganja guy and
you have a machinist who also is into
[SPEAKER_19]: ganja, but maybe didn't spend the last 10
or 20 years like flipping packs or,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, growing herb or whatever.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's sort of like there's these symbiotic
relationships that obviously happen
[SPEAKER_19]: between a grower and an extractor,
between a machinist and a puffer.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, how else are you going to know
if you're making a great material?
[SPEAKER_19]: You might be the greatest machinist on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you don't have that sort of,
we've got to come up with a name for it
[SPEAKER_19]: too.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want it to be like the hashish or oil
sommelier, almost like the equivalent of a
[SPEAKER_19]: wine sommelier, but in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know the term for it myself,
but I'm sure now that we've mentioned it,
[SPEAKER_19]: someone will come up with it and it will
be patented and copyrighted.
[SPEAKER_19]: Before the end of the day, but it's
something that should exist.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that we all know that there's
levels to this shit and there's always
[SPEAKER_19]: certain people that once again,
I don't know if they have a stronger
[SPEAKER_19]: olfactory or if they're able to pay more
attention to what's going on with all of
[SPEAKER_19]: their senses while they're smelling and
inhaling and being affected by these
[SPEAKER_19]: different terpenes and cannabinoid
profiles.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it seems like there's certain people
that just take it to that next level.
[SPEAKER_19]: And those people, coincidentally enough,
always have a super quality product in
[SPEAKER_19]: their stash.
[SPEAKER_19]: Speaking of stash, I think it might be
time for a little rip.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got this new nail recently, the Mr.
Hotbox.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_19]: Things beefcake, gonna be heats up in a
minute, one minute.
[SPEAKER_19]: How about that for a fast electric nail?
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm going to hit a little maple
butter.
[SPEAKER_19]: They were supposed to come in today.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure what happened.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll have to give them a hit on the
olfactory.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to hit some holy grail dry sift
rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I'm going to hit today.
[SPEAKER_19]: As you can see, I've been hitting it
pretty hard already.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this would be the time now if you have
your rig to join Reverend Bubble Man for
[SPEAKER_19]: a...
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't ask how it even became hash church,
the word church, how that became a part of
[SPEAKER_19]: it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it sure has stuck in the last three
and a half years that we've been doing
[SPEAKER_19]: this show.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, 889 people, almost 900 people in
live wanting to hear from all of you guys
[SPEAKER_19]: and how you go about making your product.
[SPEAKER_19]: I liked when Eric was talking about making
sure that the pressure isn't too great.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it was Eric actually,
it might've been honey butter in cooking
[SPEAKER_19]: the parchment.
[SPEAKER_19]: Almost the cooked parchment look and how
being able to pull that back.
[SPEAKER_19]: These are all just little sort of clues
that tell you that if you're continually
[SPEAKER_19]: cooking the parchment and you're pulling
that shit out and it's all cracked and
[SPEAKER_19]: cooked away, you need to pull back,
pull back hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've noticed that if you're over pressing,
the outline of the bag will straight cut
[SPEAKER_05]: the parchment where the plate is in
contact with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's definitely a sure sign that
you're slamming it down too far.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I've noticed also when you're
folding your pouches, you want a nice even
[SPEAKER_14]: flap if you do fold it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because otherwise if you just have half of
a flap, that pressure, even though it's
[SPEAKER_14]: the smallest amount of material,
it still applies more pressure to that
[SPEAKER_14]: center point, which that'll break into the
parchment or you don't get an even press.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it doesn't seem like much,
but it really, it is important.
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially when you're dealing with hash
pressing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the princess and the pea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you want to never under fold a bag
either because that's what will help
[SPEAKER_02]: believe with blowouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you over fold, I'd rather do that and
sacrifice a tiny bit of yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with hash because it really
matters that much at that point,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you're going for quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you definitely don't want to ever under
fold the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just right the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_14]: It happens though.
[SPEAKER_14]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I try to only put enough in to
make sure the folds good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can stack bags though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You press low enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't go fast enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stack bags too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember back when I was packing,
I was double packing bags.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd fold a pouch and I'd put a pouch
inside of a pouch because of all the
[SPEAKER_14]: blowouts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then it's just like, I've realized over
just, fuck that other screen.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're using excess material, excess paper
cost or whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just with the one screen and a little bit
of patience and playing with that heat and
[SPEAKER_14]: timing, it's just no need to worry.
[SPEAKER_14]: You just get it to flow out like butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% on that.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's why I kind of like the hand press as
well, like what Lindsay was mentioned
[SPEAKER_19]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_19]: What I feel is that it's intuitive.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have this intuitive press when I hand
press.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead, honey.
[SPEAKER_19]: Looked like you wanted to talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I mean, I don't use the hand press.
[SPEAKER_14]: I played with it a lot and I understand
how people really feel it when pressing
[SPEAKER_14]: the hash and all, but for me, I really
dial it in on the compressor and just
[SPEAKER_14]: dialing down the pressure.
[SPEAKER_14]: For instance, I can get the press down
with the foot pump just on the compressor
[SPEAKER_14]: down to 5 PSI before it shuts out and does
nothing.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I'm doing water hash or anything,
I usually bring the pressure down to 30
[SPEAKER_14]: PSI, which allows me to slowly bring the
blocks down.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can control at the speed that it's
dropping and the increments of how far it
[SPEAKER_14]: comes down on the pouch because it gets
real critical at that point.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a matter of a couple centimeters
and you have a blowout.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really feel it personally with the foot
pump and just dialing it on the
[SPEAKER_14]: compressor, but that's just how I've
learned.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's all on however you learn it
and just learning the tools of the trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the compressor kind of scares me,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the hash is so greasy that if I
just let the handle go on the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: hand, if I just let that handle go,
sometimes I'll have to crank it really low
[SPEAKER_00]: to the floor so that I don't take the risk
of letting the handle go and the weight of
[SPEAKER_00]: the handle dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some disasters, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have some mad skills over
there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to teach me a way.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really just a matter of messing up.
[SPEAKER_14]: You mess up and you realize what you did
and you figure out how to correct it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact is that's what I've learned on
and it's what I like.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've played with the hand press,
but I feel like I'm just starting back in
[SPEAKER_14]: the beginning with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: When it comes to the foot pump,
I feel full control on it, whether I'm
[SPEAKER_14]: cranking it up to 90 PSI and I'm going
full speed on the bag or with flour or
[SPEAKER_14]: whether I'm doing bubble hash and just
dialing in the PSI and the speed that the
[SPEAKER_14]: block comes down on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done it that way and that's how I
feel it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's just making those mistakes is
a good thing because the more you mess up,
[SPEAKER_14]: the more you understand, unless you're
messing up on the same exact thing every
[SPEAKER_14]: time, then that's just stupid.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not learning shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the difference between a costly
mistake and a valuable lesson,
[SPEAKER_19]: which are exactly the same experience.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just how you decide to perceive them.
[SPEAKER_19]: How fucked up is that?
100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find that the two speed hand pump really
makes a big difference in terms of what
[SPEAKER_04]: you can feel.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had to look at mine first.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the foot pump still and I like it a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I start to see a blowout happen,
it's nice because I can just pop it
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately and I don't have to worry
about it blowing out all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've stopped a lot of blowouts that way,
but I've also blown out more bags than you
[SPEAKER_02]: can believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've wasted so much damn money,
it pisses me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned more lessons that way too,
like you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to really get in.
[SPEAKER_14]: With the foot pedal, it's just necessary
on dialing in your PSI, which controls the
[SPEAKER_14]: speed of the blocks and just watching the
bag.
[SPEAKER_14]: Having a light directed on those blocks
and the bag that you're pressing,
[SPEAKER_14]: you really get to see the oil doing its
thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: You watch it start to come out and spread
through the bag.
[SPEAKER_14]: Depending on the quality of hash,
this is more for hash especially.
[SPEAKER_14]: Flour is a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_14]: You never really have blowouts.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you do, just crank your PSI down a
little.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're obviously pressing too much
pressure.
[SPEAKER_14]: As for hash, dialing it in, you're slowing
down your blocks.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can really feel the increments as it
goes through with each drop.
[SPEAKER_14]: Depending on the quality of hash that
you're pressing, that's what you really
[SPEAKER_14]: need to understand.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you're pressing your six stars and
your five stars, that shit's pure oil
[SPEAKER_14]: almost.
[SPEAKER_14]: Six stars, there's very little
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're pressing 90% up returns.
[SPEAKER_14]: With your five stars, you're getting 80%
in up returns.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little hard to have a blowout,
but then again, it's all about patience
[SPEAKER_14]: and watching that bag, watching the flow,
understanding what you're pressing.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're pressing something with a lot
more contaminant, you need to understand
[SPEAKER_14]: that you can't apply as much pressure
because eventually you're going to get to
[SPEAKER_14]: a point where all that contaminant is
maxed out in the bag and now you're just
[SPEAKER_14]: pressing that out.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to get blowouts with that,
not from pressing too quick, but from
[SPEAKER_14]: pressing with too much pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is everybody here using bags?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Elishan likes the Chemex rep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just wondering if anybody else has
anything out there, different bags.
[SPEAKER_19]: I use bags and not bags.
[SPEAKER_19]: I use a hand pump and a foot pump with an
air compressor.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a couple of them set up and just
have variety available to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: With flour, I like a good pre-press and no
bags sometimes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I used to press with no bags.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just for production and scaling up and
especially with the way the industry is
[SPEAKER_14]: going out here in Southern California,
just California particularly, I just feel
[SPEAKER_14]: like learning how to scale things on a
mass level and maintain quality is going
[SPEAKER_14]: to be key.
[SPEAKER_14]: When it comes to pressing without a screen
and then cleaning it up afterwards,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's not a bad idea, but the fact is you
don't get to reduce the mass that you're
[SPEAKER_14]: pressing and you're taking up more space
with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like even to a certain point when
you're pressing without a screen,
[SPEAKER_14]: you have that material that's still
absorbing and maintaining a certain amount
[SPEAKER_14]: of oil because you're not reducing the
amount of space that it's taking.
[SPEAKER_14]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone asked, how do I know when I'm
getting lipids and wax in my rosin?
[SPEAKER_14]: Whenever you're pressing flour rosin,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't give a fuck because you more
likely smoke flour anyway, so why give a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit if it's a bit of rosin?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's good with a little bit
of fat on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Lipids and waxes are a lot more dangerous
when you're smoking something that's been
[SPEAKER_19]: made with a non-polar solvent like BHO,
which removes those natural bronchial
[SPEAKER_19]: dilators, the things that protect us.
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess, what did Jim Frere call them?
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I could remember the name.
[SPEAKER_19]: Allocation points?
No.
[SPEAKER_19]: Some type of point in the lungs that
cannabis protects our lungs from these
[SPEAKER_19]: things.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you use a non-polar solvent,
you leave behind the polar and semi-polar
[SPEAKER_19]: components.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those components are the things that
protect you from things like fats and
[SPEAKER_19]: lipids getting deeper into your lungs than
they should get.
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't really explain it as well as I
probably could have had I've been thinking
[SPEAKER_19]: about it a bit, but it's something to look
into.
[SPEAKER_19]: Fats and lipids, definitely a lot more of
a problem when you're using a non-polar
[SPEAKER_19]: solvent.
[SPEAKER_19]: When you're extracting hash or oil or
smoking bud, the built-in safety mechanism
[SPEAKER_19]: is that the bud already contains these
nucleation points, these components that
[SPEAKER_19]: become nucleation points in the lungs,
and they sort of stop things from getting
[SPEAKER_19]: deeper into our lungs than are supposed
to.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's why it's not a very good idea to
smoke tobacco with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cannabis being an expectorant,
it allows the lungs to open up,
[SPEAKER_19]: whereas the tobacco, the lungs want to
close up.
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't want tobacco to get deep into
your lungs.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cannabis can help that.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_14]: As for fats and lipids as well,
you can notice, I feel like that's more of
[SPEAKER_14]: a future talk as far as fats and lipids
and rosin because no one's really at the
[SPEAKER_14]: point of figuring out how to extract them
as far as I know or separate them.
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing that you can observe when
pressing is a lot of flour rosins.
[SPEAKER_14]: They seem to have more fats than lipids.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll notice it when you smoke them.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to hit it a little cooler,
otherwise you get more of that char.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not quite char, but more, it burns,
chars up.
[SPEAKER_14]: It does char up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where was I going with that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Live rosin, for instance, or water hash,
or even just hash rosin in particular,
[SPEAKER_14]: you'll notice has a cleaner burn.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can hit it a little hotter.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's usually better in clarity.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some flour rosins, though, like a lot of
OGs that I run into or more of your sappy
[SPEAKER_14]: consistencies, tend to be able to be less
fats and lipids as far as you can observe
[SPEAKER_14]: on the burn.
[SPEAKER_14]: Comparing as far as dabbing and smoking
them, they seem to have less fats and
[SPEAKER_14]: lipids.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like the fats and lipids are
obviously what's responsible for that
[SPEAKER_14]: undesirable taste when you're hitting it a
little bit too hot.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll notice you can hit live rosin
hotter than you can flour rosin,
[SPEAKER_14]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's almost no carbon footprint
left on the nail when you dab hash rosins.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you burn off a nail, not everybody
has a super clean nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us aren't scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll burn a little bit off, but you
actually see the whole story when you take
[SPEAKER_00]: a dab and it's wet on the nail,
and then you burn it off with a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash rosin normally will just puddle a
little bit, turn a little bit black,
[SPEAKER_00]: and burn off gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flour rosin likes to really get black.
[SPEAKER_00]: You almost see lift off the nail sometimes
of the carbon burning and flaking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same with BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a dab of that sauce and you
burn that excess shit off your nail,
[SPEAKER_00]: it leaves the exact same residuals most of
the time as flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash rosin, I've never really seen too
much residuals left behind.
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree 100% with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially a lot of these guys with their
heady glass and their expensive ass cords
[SPEAKER_14]: and all that, you'll notice that they're
real picky about what's being dabbed on
[SPEAKER_14]: their nails.
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't like flour rosin to be dabbed
out on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll notice some people have the
specific nail just to smoke rosin.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the fats and lipids, and you'll
notice that the flour rosin tends to do it
[SPEAKER_14]: more.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say that the majority of flour
rosin out there being pressed is going to
[SPEAKER_14]: have that taste for the most part and is
responsible for the reason why there's a
[SPEAKER_14]: lot of people out there that have rosin as
a bad taste in their mouth.
[SPEAKER_14]: Majority of people don't understand
quality control.
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't have the eye and they don't
have the ability to test it, to see the
[SPEAKER_14]: yields, to see the quality of the rosin
and taste it, experience it, and
[SPEAKER_14]: understand every part of it to understand
all the important factors of what's
[SPEAKER_14]: important in the quality of the flours
that you're pressing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it really comes to working close
with growers and people that are
[SPEAKER_14]: open-minded and understanding that we're
extracting the plants, we actually get to
[SPEAKER_14]: see the resin.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm starting to get lost with what I was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to add in that that
grower-extractor relationship is something
[SPEAKER_05]: that's kind of new.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only some people have been doing it on
purpose for a while and now realizing that
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the cornerstone of your quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think growers are starting to listen
more, and I think they're really going to
[SPEAKER_05]: start listening more because it's going to
be a matter of survival in this new
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they want to do something that works,
they need to pay attention to their
[SPEAKER_05]: extractor, to their vessel that gets their
product to the market.
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree, especially for my own brand.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to put my name on anything
that's not the highest of quality.
[SPEAKER_19]: At that point, I really have to have a lot
to say about how the grows being grown and
[SPEAKER_19]: the cultivars that are being used and the
people that are in the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not really just a relationship that's
completely cut off that you show up and
[SPEAKER_19]: you're like, yeah, yeah, I'm just going to
process whatever's in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's levels to this shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you have something that's worth
processing, then we can talk about a
[SPEAKER_19]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_19]: Before that, who wants to waste their
time?
[SPEAKER_19]: Unless you haven't learned yet,
and then it's not a waste of time,
[SPEAKER_19]: but once you've learned, it quickly
becomes aware to you that processing the
[SPEAKER_19]: wrong cultivars or the poorly grown right
cultivars is not worth your time.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you can pass that message on to the
grower, A, don't grow poorly, poor
[SPEAKER_19]: cultivars that aren't going to express
themselves, even if you grow them
[SPEAKER_19]: perfectly, and grow hash producing
cultivars that will allow us to get a
[SPEAKER_19]: yield and allow our relationship to work
out for everyone rather than no one.
[SPEAKER_19]: Water hash has been a tight one for years,
processing water hash in particular.
[SPEAKER_19]: Raw is much different, especially when you
get a cultivar like the bike, the where's
[SPEAKER_19]: my bike, which we should welcome Neil and
John into the room there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maple butter in the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: So guys, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to press a little,
where's my bike here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So guys, everybody on the panel,
thanks for inviting us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, we feel very honored to be
invited on a panel of such a high caliber.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's funny, you guys are talking about
like the grower and extractor
[SPEAKER_06]: relationship, because that's pretty much
how me and John got together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was mostly more the grower and
he was more the extractor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we really clicked when
Rosin came together a couple years ago
[SPEAKER_06]: when we first heard it on Hashtrush.
[SPEAKER_06]: So very honored to be here today.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, why don't you guys give your
introduction, how you guys got into,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, producing and processing and all
of that and how you were led into
[SPEAKER_19]: producing Canadian artesian rosin?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, basically, like most of the people
on the panel, we started with DHO until
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of got introduced to the rosin scene
and started with not so much success,
[SPEAKER_10]: like with a hair straightener,
basically pressing whatever we could find.
[SPEAKER_10]: And once we realized that, like you said,
the quality control when you can control
[SPEAKER_10]: everything from seed to oil, then we had a
lot of success squishing a lot of our own
[SPEAKER_10]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it was more finding cultivars
that had specific terpene profiles that
[SPEAKER_10]: matched what we were looking for.
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, it's been a, you know,
a journey to find certain genetics that
[SPEAKER_10]: we've been working with.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of things we've had to produce
for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not necessarily cuts that are
commercially passed around.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in our area, there's not too much of a
variety going around.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody seems to go for the more how
much can I get and how fast can I get is
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of a mentality.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, we're growing more like 12-week
strains or 13-week strains and things like
[SPEAKER_06]: that, which again is not the typical,
you know, yielders around here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not really looking at flower
production.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're more looking at resin production.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have certain, you know, cultivars
that are producing nearly 30% returns on
[SPEAKER_06]: rosin and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, that's mostly it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Genetics and pressing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, well, that's definitely what
attracted me to you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm loving the Where Is My Bike.
[SPEAKER_19]: I get damn near 30% every time I press it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm pressing the nugget out right now,
actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I smoke a ton of the rosin that you
guys make.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm always stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Glad you're loving it, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's just, it is such an incredible
thing to just be able to squish a bud and
[SPEAKER_19]: get dabs.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like that was some like, that was the,
okay, that was the equivalent in bubble
[SPEAKER_19]: bags to the pulling of the 73 bag for the
first time ever, anyone ever seen it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like you pull out that yellow bag and
everyone's eyebrows would go up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeing oil squish out of a bud is
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's, anyways, it was definitely a
good genetic to have that, that Where Is
[SPEAKER_06]: My Bike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely a keeper.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just one that has like a really
intense terpene profile as well that we
[SPEAKER_10]: find that really follows through in a
rosin, whereas a lot of these strains,
[SPEAKER_10]: it depends, a lot of the cushions and
stuff we find around here are super
[SPEAKER_10]: temperamental when you're using heat,
like a lot of guys were explaining before
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we find the bike is really like,
it's loud, loud, loud, and it almost
[SPEAKER_10]: butters right away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: It definitely buttered right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does everyone know they're using
parchment?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some people like the PTFE and then
there's the oil slick silicon paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're using parchment.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I don't like the PTFE.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you can put the PTFE inside of a
piece of parchment paper, but it likes to
[SPEAKER_14]: ripple and make it hard for collection as
far as like pressing on a smaller scale
[SPEAKER_14]: and like flower rosin, things like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you're doing more like
directional flow and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, maybe, but just overall parchment
seems to be the best thing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that PTFE stuff kind of attracts a
lot of things like hair, dust,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's in your environment likes
to stick to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really like it, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's ultra sticky.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tried just about everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a pretty open mind to things and
I've definitely found parchment paper to
[SPEAKER_07]: be overall the easiest thing to work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't noticed any kind of parchment
contaminant in any rosin that I've ever
[SPEAKER_07]: made.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd say definitely be easy on the
pressure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you don't want to be blowing out
your parchment and having those pouch and
[SPEAKER_14]: grit.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're seeing your pouch pressing into
the parchment, which someone was
[SPEAKER_14]: discussing earlier, you're definitely
pressing too hard.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, lower your pressure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't click down so many times.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, test your yields.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, your yields are going to be the
same.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people like to just give it its
all, thinking they're getting every last
[SPEAKER_14]: drop of oil out without doing any
experimentation or recording anything and
[SPEAKER_14]: understanding that a little less pressure,
a little less time does the same exact
[SPEAKER_14]: thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's just finding that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that last bit that comes out,
I believe, is much higher in fats and
[SPEAKER_07]: lipids than the initial bit that comes out
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So using that extra pressure to keep
pressing it until it turns brown is
[SPEAKER_07]: something that I suggest.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I like the hand pump,
just because you get the fuel for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimately, I'd like to have one hand pump
set up and then one electric pump going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once you dial it in, then you
just produce on your electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to me, the artist in the craft comes
up with a hand pump.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I've used them both.
[SPEAKER_19]: You could become pretty artistic with that
foot pedal too.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just depends on whether you want to use
your hand or your foot for that
[SPEAKER_19]: connection.
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely prefer the hand pump when I'm
pressing hash and the foot pump when I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: pressing flower or even the electric pump.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they all get the job done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly pressed a lot with the hand
pump and the foot pump and started to say,
[SPEAKER_07]: I like one over the other.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just depends on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you definitely get more fuel from
the hand pump.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you're doing high production or
something like that, it seems like having
[SPEAKER_13]: some kind of automatic system might
actually be a lot better.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, trying to squish a pound of hash
with a hand pump would suck ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the fuck I would do with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just meant having both.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could dial it in with the hand pump
and then just set your electric up to
[SPEAKER_04]: repeat that.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, ramping rates and determining,
just basically generating data to
[SPEAKER_13]: determine how quickly you can actually
ramp based on the size of filter that you
[SPEAKER_13]: actually have.
[SPEAKER_13]: Something that I've been working on
recently, but you end up finding that each
[SPEAKER_13]: filter has a different ramping rate,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so you'll find, obviously,
that with some filters, you can actually
[SPEAKER_13]: increase your ramp at a rate of,
I don't know, something like 300 to,
[SPEAKER_13]: actually, it would be more like about
1,500 psi every minute.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or you could even decrease it down to as
low as 800 psi every minute.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it all really depends on the size of
the filter that you actually have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not everyone understands that the
pressure from the press is actually
[SPEAKER_04]: determined by the size of the bag.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people think, I got a 25 ton
press.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm doing every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it depends on the size of the bag
you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even for hash and stuff like that,
the quality of the hash also depends on
[SPEAKER_02]: how much you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've definitely kept logs of all of
that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep a log of the quality and how much
hash I can put in each bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been trying to make some kind of
thing myself with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also like to log everything in a book of
every press I do with the temperatures and
[SPEAKER_02]: returns and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if there's a blowout or
something, I make sure to log that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We put a little calculator on our
touchscreen that we put the bag size in.
[SPEAKER_04]: The number of bags you're using.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it calculates the exact pressure on
the bag or where to bring your pump to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And vice versa.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do a nice press and you see where
you brought your pump cage to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can the back calculate what the
pressure on the bag was so that you can do
[SPEAKER_04]: that every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: From experimenting, you find your metrics.
[SPEAKER_05]: You find your, sorry, you find out where
your consistencies are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from there, you can scale with
different material, different
[SPEAKER_05]: temperatures, different amounts in the
bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just kind of dialing it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, I'm all by feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any adjustment on my foot
pump or any gauge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used just out of the box from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been my baseline for everything
I've experimented with.
[SPEAKER_19]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's definitely something to think
about.
[SPEAKER_19]: Where that pressure is coming down on top
of your screen is where that's what you're
[SPEAKER_19]: thinking of.
[SPEAKER_19]: Blowouts is definitely a big problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think also a big problem is potentially
that a lot of the screen that's being used
[SPEAKER_19]: is maybe not rated for pressure or for
heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we just went through making our own
bags and just trying to find the proper
[SPEAKER_04]: material was a chore in itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took a few months, especially in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the bags we're using right now
come out of Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a polyester monofilament coming out
of Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure I can do cheaper,
but that's just, to me, it was just the
[SPEAKER_04]: best bag.
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't seem to stretch.
[SPEAKER_19]: I bet you can't do cheaper because
honestly, I've been doing this screen for
[SPEAKER_19]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's both heat and pressure rated.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's expensive stuff and they don't knock
it off in China well at all.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the reason why I've always used it is
because it's heat stamped so that it won't
[SPEAKER_19]: ever lose its hold.
[SPEAKER_19]: If it goes in and out of water many,
many, many times, it doesn't lose the
[SPEAKER_19]: actual micron diameter of the hole.
[SPEAKER_19]: It keeps that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas like some silk and some other
materials, they don't do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: The more they get exposed to water and
weather, they will lose their hold.
[SPEAKER_19]: They won't hold that same size.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why bubble bags are warrantied for
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I found a lot with like a lot of
bags to press is that like, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: with hashes, is that you'll actually have
where the seams are sewn in, they'll open
[SPEAKER_02]: up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like to personally double bag my
stuff to keep quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll do opposing sides of the seam so
everything gets caught the opposite way
[SPEAKER_02]: and it double filters everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't really go for yields either
whenever I press.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's a very good idea with the
quality that you're dealing with because a
[SPEAKER_19]: blowout is just such a bummer.
[SPEAKER_19]: And to have to expose it to extra heat,
like gathering it all and re-screening it
[SPEAKER_19]: and trying to get it to press better,
I think it's better to just make sure
[SPEAKER_19]: those seams are on point or just double it
up on opposite sides so that you don't get
[SPEAKER_19]: that, blowouts are a bummer when the hash
contaminates the oil, especially when it's
[SPEAKER_19]: a pretty decent quality hash already.
[SPEAKER_19]: You just get these kind of like chunks
inside this beautiful oil and it's a
[SPEAKER_19]: little bit rough.
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you guys feel about the tail end
and like the head and the tail of rosin?
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you feel that there is or isn't or more
in flower rosin and hash rosin?
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you like to mix them?
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you like to keep them separate?
[SPEAKER_19]: I definitely like to keep them separate
myself.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just feel like even from a photography
standpoint without, if I didn't even puff
[SPEAKER_19]: it at all, that one is just way nicer
looking under the lens.
[SPEAKER_19]: And generally it's the one I also find
myself puffing on more often than not,
[SPEAKER_19]: that early head of the squish compared to
the tail.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it also depends on whose head and
whose tail we're talking because some
[SPEAKER_19]: people, the tail is a lot and other people
just give it like a little tiny like,
[SPEAKER_19]: oh yeah, that tail wasn't so bad at all.
[SPEAKER_19]: The end result of that squish was actually
on point with the first one.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I've seen both, but for myself,
I do like the head of the squish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually have a pretty small tail on my
squishes and I like to cut it off a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: early, but then I like to do a lot of my
second squishes and I'll do a lot of my
[SPEAKER_02]: experimentation and stuff like that with
that because it's a good way to do it for
[SPEAKER_02]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I agree there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a really tough thing for
people that are making rosin.
[SPEAKER_14]: Having that deciding factor of whether to
put them together, because for some
[SPEAKER_14]: material, it can be a huge sacrifice in
yield.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're sacrificing quality by putting in
that tail end or you're removing that and
[SPEAKER_14]: increasing the quality, but you're
sacrificing your yield at that point.
[SPEAKER_14]: So at that point, it becomes trying to
find a happy medium for that, deciding on
[SPEAKER_14]: whether maybe this micron that was pressed
can be mixed in the whole or whether it's
[SPEAKER_14]: too dark and the taste isn't there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't taste like anything that the
rest of it doesn't have the same terpenes
[SPEAKER_14]: as the other microns or whatever the case
is.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a big thing, especially in
the whole dispensary market or trying to
[SPEAKER_14]: make a business out of it, having a
consistent wholesale number or something
[SPEAKER_14]: like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It becomes tough because certain material
does different things and it's really
[SPEAKER_14]: depending on what you want your quality to
be.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you want that super clear,
just bomb all the way through.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people are sacrificing tail end or
there's a lot of material out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you really know what you're looking for
and you're working with the right growers
[SPEAKER_14]: and they're being open-minded and they're
cutting and they're starting new things,
[SPEAKER_14]: then you'll find those strains that just
give you great yields all the way through
[SPEAKER_14]: with quality oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's another thing for rosin too
is having that eye for quality and knowing
[SPEAKER_14]: what to keep separated and what to put
together.
[SPEAKER_19]: It also depends on where you're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_19]: Some people are coming from the
perspective that I just want to puff the
[SPEAKER_19]: highest quality material that I can puff
and other people are like, I am trying to
[SPEAKER_19]: do $1.3 million a year with my new
business and they're both as respectable.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not putting one above the other,
but obviously when it's a business,
[SPEAKER_19]: mixing in the tail end and getting it or
keeping it separate and still being able
[SPEAKER_19]: to sell it for a decent dollar is usually
going to be the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_19]: When it's puffing for your own head,
the bottom line is much different.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a lot fewer things past the
test.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I would say about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree there for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: It all depends on what you're looking for
and what you're trying to be.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nothing wrong with having
everything together.
[SPEAKER_14]: It still makes a great quality oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not saying that it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_14]: For me, I have all these little globs of
these tail ends that I really don't do
[SPEAKER_14]: anything with.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're great for experimentation.
[SPEAKER_14]: They really are, especially if you want to
try learning making sauce in THCA.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's popular right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you really want to play with that,
it's good learning material to play with.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have less loss in the R&D.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people keep it in, some people take
it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: It really depends on the material,
I think.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's an important part of making
quality rosin.
[SPEAKER_14]: Rosin, that's going to be desirable,
knowing what to keep, what to pull,
[SPEAKER_14]: and what to keep together.
[SPEAKER_14]: Whether it's five grams on the whole pound
that you're keeping out, that's the tail
[SPEAKER_14]: end.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes it's not a loss.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really not.
[SPEAKER_14]: Knowing to keep that out, just to have
that much better of a product,
[SPEAKER_14]: is important.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's an important part of making
quality solventless concentrates.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely think that for flour rosin,
only doing one squish and not mixing in
[SPEAKER_06]: the tail end is a definite must.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then when I'm doing more dry sift rosins
or lower temperature rosins like bubble
[SPEAKER_06]: hash or something, then I can do two
squishes and I can mix them together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find I've got a very similar
consistency, but in flour rosin,
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely can't do a second squish and
put it back in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It contaminates the whole lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: It affects color and lubrication.
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd say flour rosin has a bigger tail end.
[SPEAKER_14]: I always say flour rosin is anywhere from
a three to five percent tail end,
[SPEAKER_14]: depending on the flowers and depending on
how you feel about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: To me, that's what I feel.
[SPEAKER_14]: In most cases, flour rosin tends to have a
three to five percent tail end.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can keep it in there, and I'm not
going to say the rosin's bad at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still quality rosin, but if you want
to improve clarity, color, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_14]: the taste for the people who are real
picky, they'll notice the difference for
[SPEAKER_14]: the masses.
[SPEAKER_14]: They might not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely depends on what you're
squishing and how hard you're pressing at
[SPEAKER_05]: it as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Working backward from yield and working
towards quality, I think, is the mindset
[SPEAKER_05]: that's most important.
[SPEAKER_05]: If your end result is to make something
that's really tasty, then you're not going
[SPEAKER_05]: to press the very end of the bag out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to press it all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, some strains have a big tail end,
like you said, and some don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but how about when you're doing a
press and the flow that begins is dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when you leave it in there to get
the full press done, when you open the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper, there's a blonde butter all inside
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the flow is dark, you're looking at
that shit like, man, I don't know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell to do with that, but that shit all
around the bag right there, that's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: other story.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it's like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I press so much different stuff that
there's so many different results.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had that happen to me recently with
some bubble hash, and I don't know that
[SPEAKER_14]: it's... For instance, the first wash I
did, I pressed it out and just dark rosin,
[SPEAKER_14]: and the second wash, it kept getting
lighter all the way to the seventh wash.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just got way lighter, and I didn't know
what that was, or really what to say about
[SPEAKER_14]: it, or how to explain it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as what you're saying, to me,
it sounds like when something comes out
[SPEAKER_14]: stable off the press, it tends to be
darker.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not always, but it tends to be darker than
when it's buttered.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you were to take something that's
clear, stable, and then you either whip it
[SPEAKER_14]: up, or you allow it to naturally nucleate,
it's going to lighten up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what I'm trying to say is,
if you were to take, let's just say you
[SPEAKER_00]: took an ounce of hash, you put it in a
sack, you put it in the paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: you put it in the press, you bang it down,
you're going for one press, that start to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out is dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at like, man, I could have
swore that was going to be way lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming out dark, not like TV remote
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not presently dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darker of a color than you were expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you let the press finish,
the press is finishing, it's getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the flow, you're like,
all right, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull the pressure up, pull the paper
out, and when you open the paper up,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the drips are dark, but everything
that's on the paper is a light,
[SPEAKER_00]: white, creamy, blonde butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: All from that one press.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you allow that stable part that comes
through, when you allow it to cross over
[SPEAKER_14]: and completely butter, is it an equal
color?
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it get lighter?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it comparable to the butter that's on
the block?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, once that stuff starts to actually
butter up, it starts to get really light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can literally stick your dabber in it,
and you can pull it, and it gets clear and
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to turn into sugar as you're
pulling it from that darker mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just keep pulling it with your
dabber, it's like block.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks exactly like the buttered stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some stuff's just weird on the press.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, at that point, to me,
I would say you have crystallite,
[SPEAKER_14]: or it's nucleating.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's turning to butter.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you think about it, it's pressing
off of there.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's effervescence going on.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have all these terpenes creating
bubbles with the heat and escaping.
[SPEAKER_14]: So now you have all this air trapped
inside of this rosin.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think when it butters up,
that's also responsible to some point why
[SPEAKER_14]: it's becoming lighter.
[SPEAKER_14]: Air trapped inside of it, then buttering
up, it lightens up compared to something
[SPEAKER_14]: that's just so dense.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, as compared to butter,
I would say stable rosin is more dense.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that's why it's not as light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just crazy, because the rosin
that flows out is that darker color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the stuff, I mean,
sometimes it even looks like THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so white and crumbly all around the
whole inside, because you know you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: your sag, and you have the space all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the way around your vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the space, the void I'm talking
about that fills with this crazy white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken lots of pictures of it and put
it on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on who you're talking to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when that happens, it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like you're almost creating two
separate fractions, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's crazy, because that second
fraction will eventually turn into what
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like around the pouch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I think is kind of happening is
possibly like you're catalysting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Sogram was saying, you're
catalysting the process with the oxygen
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of comes out on the initial
plates when it sits for a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if it matches up whenever you end
up later on down the road and after you
[SPEAKER_02]: whip it up, I feel like it's just the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just happened a lot faster,
because the heat and everything has gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: way quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because heat, everybody knows,
kind of helps catalyst that THCA forming,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what makes the butter turn into a
white color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inside of butter rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just don't know enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some crazy shit on the press
that I just can't explain sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've even had THCA forming around my
back where I fold the papers over like
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up white THCA all forming,
not even butter, like beyond butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you must be pressing like real low
temps then, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Below two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ghost presses were going at like 180.
[SPEAKER_00]: To 200 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just really dry resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like super, super dry resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice and stable resin then,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could definitely call it
stable for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like stuff that's really hard to press
and, you know, and paper and shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, for me, dude, I feel like,
you know, I feel like the temperature that
[SPEAKER_14]: the deciding factor for me is when when
nucleation and crystallization stop
[SPEAKER_14]: occurring off the block.
[SPEAKER_14]: So for instance, some strains,
you can press them at 180 degrees and you
[SPEAKER_14]: can get them out clear and stable.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then some strains, they're less
viscous.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're more of a stable starting
material.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they like to shatter or you can
touch them with the hand.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they tend to need more heat to push
them out.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I feel like, you know, just having just
enough temp pushes out and enough time to
[SPEAKER_14]: stop the process of nucleation.
[SPEAKER_14]: So therefore, you know, having just even
five degrees under the temp that it might
[SPEAKER_14]: need.
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe it comes out clear and stable at
205 degrees.
[SPEAKER_14]: But at 200 degrees, you know, it's pushing
out clear and clear or stable resin.
[SPEAKER_14]: But inside of the blocks, it has enough
time to sit on that heat and to move to
[SPEAKER_14]: the next phase.
[SPEAKER_14]: It starts to butter up.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all through observations and theory
and things that I think.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what I tell myself.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what I feel, you know,
but I think ultimately, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we got to get together, do a design
experiment and with an analysis lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we get a lot of answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it costs a bit of money,
but I think I do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're at that phase now.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's going to start happening a
lot, especially with the I mean,
[SPEAKER_14]: out here, there's going to be testing
required on everything in a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, some people do it now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people do it occasionally.
[SPEAKER_14]: They do.
[SPEAKER_14]: They test stuff here and there.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, every everything we do is
going to have to be tested at some point.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, it's all going to be on the
paper.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a matter of how how trustworthy
are these companies and how accurate is
[SPEAKER_14]: this data?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you're going to have to connect
with the right people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as it becomes more mainstream and
illegal and more states, we're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: see the scientists getting into this big
time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So doing proper analysis, I think that's
that's sort of the next step.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next step for where we're going to
bring the next phase of rosin to probably
[SPEAKER_04]: in everything.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it sure has been moving at a quick
accelerated rate, almost quicker than the
[SPEAKER_19]: actual data itself.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just being hammered out left,
right and center.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of people are squishing rosin both
on a commercial level and on a just
[SPEAKER_19]: personal level.
[SPEAKER_19]: The hash that I just made, the oil that I
just made was very lovely.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a bit to get off the parchment,
but it is absolutely stellar quality for a
[SPEAKER_19]: little bud press.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you dab it?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah, I do dab it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I did dab it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_19]: Turpenaline, one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's real exotic sativa sort of flavor.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got eleven thirty.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been going for two and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_19]: I could easily go for another half hour.
[SPEAKER_19]: We could definitely bring some other other
rosin conversations into play here that we
[SPEAKER_19]: haven't covered.
[SPEAKER_19]: A few people asked how everyone goes about
like preserving the quality of their large
[SPEAKER_19]: quantities of rosin, you know,
100 plus grams at a time.
[SPEAKER_19]: How do you preserve it to stay the way it
is?
[SPEAKER_19]: I just use like, yeah, cold.
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Basic dollars for the wind.
[SPEAKER_14]: I say, you know, for short term storage,
refrigeration, you know, back ceiling,
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Long term storage, freezing as long as
you're not if you're going to be freezing
[SPEAKER_14]: something, it needs to be airtight,
sealed up.
[SPEAKER_14]: And at that point, when you transfer it,
like let's say you're going to consume it
[SPEAKER_14]: and you want to use it, it's in the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you take it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to let it fall out, you know,
let it get warm enough to where you can
[SPEAKER_14]: wipe the condensation off before you open
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, you're just going to add
condensation into your hash, just as if
[SPEAKER_14]: you would take it out of the fridge.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you open it up right away.
[SPEAKER_14]: You get a little sizzle on the nail
because you smoked it too soon.
[SPEAKER_14]: You didn't let it wait.
[SPEAKER_14]: Warm up.
True.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I find that preserving smaller
portions is easier than preserving large
[SPEAKER_05]: portions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like to take like any big disks or
chunks and try and store it like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once it's at that point, I think getting
it portioned, you know, in its parchment,
[SPEAKER_05]: in its baggie, in its package,
in its back seal and into the refrigerator
[SPEAKER_05]: is the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when you store a large piece of
rosin, you know, you have this whole big
[SPEAKER_05]: thing that is going to change.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, you have to kind of see
what it looks like after it's come out of
[SPEAKER_05]: the fridge, after you've taken it out of
its baggie and after it sat on the counter
[SPEAKER_05]: for half an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might take something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be something, you know,
is really, really good, but it needs 30
[SPEAKER_05]: minutes, 60 minutes to breathe and warm
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it just starts reeking.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'd say, I'd say, I mean,
for me, I would say when you break it down
[SPEAKER_14]: into half grams and you get all ready,
you're actually putting it into its
[SPEAKER_14]: shortest shelf life.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, as for storage, you can store at
cool temps and still slow it down.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say if you have a massive amount
and you want to store it, to ball it up
[SPEAKER_14]: into a, you know, don't have it as a slab,
ball it up.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, remove as much oxygen as
possible, cold as temps possible.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you know, reducing surface area
and, you know, removing oxygen and
[SPEAKER_14]: allowing the coldest environment I think
is going to be the best for storage.
[SPEAKER_14]: When it comes to, you know, half gramming
it up, whether it's in the fridge or it's
[SPEAKER_14]: in the freezer, I feel like it's still
degrading faster because now you've
[SPEAKER_14]: maximized surface area.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you coin it out or you throw a
glob in there, but they're all half
[SPEAKER_14]: grammed with, you know, plenty of oxygen
surrounding it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oxidization is our biggest enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're talking about moisture,
I want to just bring something that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of off topic though, but with freeze
dryers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're saying you know, you put a
jar in a freezer, you put it in the fridge
[SPEAKER_00]: and you take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to let it get, you know,
to room temp and wipe it off before you
[SPEAKER_00]: open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how about freeze dryers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people take this hash out of their
freeze dryer and it's frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It literally is coming from outer space
and they're bringing it into a room that's
[SPEAKER_00]: cold as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're fucking breaking it down
and jarring it up or putting it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: mason jars and storing it back in the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you think there's a shitload of
moisture though in that hash if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually sit out back on earth,
you know, back on this planet in our
[SPEAKER_00]: normal environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't you imagine that that hash would
still have moisture and still be wet?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, in theory, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I would imagine that pulling it
from such a cold environment.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you're pulling it from like a
cold freeze dryer into your cold ass hash
[SPEAKER_14]: room, it's really going to help.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, as long as you're packaging it in
a really cold environment, you're going to
[SPEAKER_14]: have less condensation occur.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if it's coming from like fucking
negative temps to a cold, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: 40 degree hash room.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you're still probably going to have
condensation.
[SPEAKER_14]: And at that point, I would say letting it
sit out and air dry a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like if you take it into a cold
room, I don't feel like the moisture is
[SPEAKER_00]: gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's just frozen with the
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put it into jars and you're
sealing in moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why a lot of this stuff likes
to butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of the freeze dry hash that you
see that's on the market is butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all buttered up and peered into jars,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like a lot of people are
packaging their stuff in cold rooms and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping everything cold, but they don't
realize the hash has to eventually come to
[SPEAKER_00]: planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be introduced into humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be introduced, you know what
I mean, right back into this environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, no matter what,
I feel like that moisture hasn't never
[SPEAKER_00]: left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you leave it in the jar and you sell
it to somebody like French and cannoli,
[SPEAKER_00]: I seen like a little while ago,
there was some hash that was like moldy in
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the kind of shit that happens
when you fucking leave moisture or you
[SPEAKER_00]: have any kind of colony forming units.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that mildew hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that ain't that emerald triangle funk.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the no bueno funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of freeze dried stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've even freeze dried a lot of my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still feel like microplaning and not
putting it into them extreme cold
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and pulling it back on it
still dries hash better than a freeze
[SPEAKER_00]: dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're going for true connoisseur
headstache type hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get it, in my opinion,
using a freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit just clumps up weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just weird, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it just spacey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just weird.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's definitely different.
[SPEAKER_19]: I prefer to photograph properly cured
resin.
[SPEAKER_19]: It shows up beautiful and globular.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've always found that the freeze
dried stuff seems to have a large amount
[SPEAKER_19]: of capitate stocks, even though they seem
to be artifacts.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're true selves.
[SPEAKER_19]: They just seem to be almost like shadows
of their former self.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're still present in the photography.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're very like visible.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't like that either.
[SPEAKER_19]: I prefer, I also am not a fan of smoking
only white hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: I definitely like some, some, some amber
and color to my hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love some white hash, but I also love
some dark cash and some golden and you
[SPEAKER_19]: know, all the different hues.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're, we're seeing that a lot with the
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, people seem to want to see
things that are super light, super,
[SPEAKER_06]: super clear and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you look at the growers point of
view, it's, I mean, it's, it's their early
[SPEAKER_06]: heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what we're basically,
you know, people are, are wanting to see
[SPEAKER_06]: their rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted to see this clear light rosin,
but sometimes, you know, you get those
[SPEAKER_06]: really amber heads and then you can do
this really nice dark rosin that still has
[SPEAKER_06]: so much turps in it and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people are not, you know,
they're, they're, they're hating on the
[SPEAKER_06]: color of the rosin when they're not really
looking at the quality of the,
[SPEAKER_06]: of the, of the, of the resin.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's interesting when you allow,
I guess I would say the majority of the
[SPEAKER_19]: marketplace, cause let's be honest,
the majority of the marketplace on planet
[SPEAKER_19]: earth is not like connoisseur heads,
just like in anything that is consumed on
[SPEAKER_19]: the planet from food to the clothing that
we wear to the quality of the cars that we
[SPEAKER_19]: drive.
[SPEAKER_19]: Not everyone is driving around in like a,
in a, in a Rolls Royce.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, like, but with cannabis,
there's a large group of people that feel
[SPEAKER_19]: like they're trying to produce the highest
quality.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I just think as, as much as it
pains me to say it, I think when this
[SPEAKER_19]: legalization thing finally occurs,
it'll be similar to all the other things
[SPEAKER_19]: that are in production.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope the quality sticks through,
but you know, with beer and all the other
[SPEAKER_19]: things that people consume on a day to day
basis, it's all, it always seems to be
[SPEAKER_19]: that the masses want the mediocre and that
only a very small percentage of people
[SPEAKER_19]: really want the best, the best,
the best.
[SPEAKER_19]: And even the people who you'll hear be
like, Oh, I need the best.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, well, you're not wearing like
the crazy $4,000 Gucci shirt.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like you're just wearing a t-shirt from
Walmart, but you need the best resin.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, can you imagine trying to need the
best of everything?
[SPEAKER_19]: How much of an insane person you would be
and not living in the reality of what most
[SPEAKER_19]: people exist in.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I get that we love the highest quality
that we can have, at least when it comes
[SPEAKER_19]: to resin.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to stop being that way.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm not sure if it'll pass through to
the masses when legalization hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to, but yeah, I think I see a lot
of bud light out there instead of actual
[SPEAKER_04]: real product.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's, you know, I, that's the
way I see it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, look at Gordon Ramsey.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: The guy's making money, but he's not
making that McDonald's money.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's probably worth like, you know what
I mean though?
[SPEAKER_19]: Like it's so true.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can't imagine what McDonald's pulls in
just in a month of rent with like 35,000
[SPEAKER_19]: locations or whatever.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like imagine all of those locations paying
McDonald's rent because McDonald's
[SPEAKER_19]: generally owns the land that those
buildings go up on.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's some serious coin right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I think in Canada here anyways,
there's going to be a, it sounds like
[SPEAKER_04]: there's going to be a micro cultivar and
microprocessing license available.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you're going to see
dispensaries that have your bud light,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you can see dispensaries that
have the good quality microprocess and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to that actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just, once again, now that's like
going to be five, maybe 10% of the
[SPEAKER_19]: marketplace, maybe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that'll be this, it'll be a niche
that the people that want to be involved
[SPEAKER_19]: in will really be fighting for because you
know, the, the industry, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_19]: I, I see everyone investing millions upon
millions upon millions upon millions of
[SPEAKER_19]: dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_19]: And to sell herb at like eight and $10 a
gram, which are basically like exactly
[SPEAKER_19]: like prohibition prices, like 4,500 bucks
for a pound of weed mail ordered through
[SPEAKER_19]: the mail through one of the legal LP's I'm
kind of hoping on seeing field grown and
[SPEAKER_19]: greenhouse grown cannabis drive the price
of cannabis down to the point where the
[SPEAKER_19]: small niche markets, I don't think
there'll be as many people vying for a
[SPEAKER_19]: position once the mark, once the perceived
prohibition based profit drops out of the
[SPEAKER_19]: bottom, hopefully of this industry in the
very near future.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because you know, not that I don't like
people making money.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think making money is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just don't think it should be equal to
the prohibition based profit margin.
[SPEAKER_19]: That came before this new sort of legal
medical recreational market that is upon
[SPEAKER_19]: us now.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like the, I like for the prices to be
cheaper, 3000, 2000 bucks for a pound is
[SPEAKER_19]: insane.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like even really 500 bucks for a pound is
pretty costly.
[SPEAKER_19]: It makes it not realistic for just anyone
to be able to access large quantities of
[SPEAKER_19]: resin for themselves.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, you know, it should be available
to people, people that are sick and dying
[SPEAKER_19]: and have like stage three and four
cancers.
[SPEAKER_19]: Should have access at a relatively
inexpensive price.
[SPEAKER_19]: Certainly not a hundred dollars a gram,
you know, three grand a pop for the 30,
[SPEAKER_19]: for the 30 grams for 30 days.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's, uh, that's it's borderline
criminal just from my perspective anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was wondering if, um, if anybody out
there, like I see the future of rosin
[SPEAKER_04]: without parchment and collection
collecting like we do right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, is anybody else?
[SPEAKER_19]: Any ideas on that on parchment free rosin
pressing?
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, I mean, the way we've designed our
press, I, um, I left a big space under the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to put a vacuum under there and
collect it as a press is like sort of a
[SPEAKER_04]: continuous batch format.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually ran into a small rosin press
manufacturer when I was at some show that
[SPEAKER_13]: had something very similar where,
where they used a it was a, uh,
[SPEAKER_13]: a form already within the press itself.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you would actually fill it,
press it through, um, had a great
[SPEAKER_13]: underneath that would actually allow the,
you know, all the resin to actually flow
[SPEAKER_13]: through to the bottom to a small
collection vessel.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, they didn't really have it quite down
to the details in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, you would get a lot of fountain flow,
meaning that, uh, the resin would flow up
[SPEAKER_13]: on the walls, um, of this little sort of
like a mold and, um, um, but anyways,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, yeah, I mean, it's definitely,
um, I think it's definitely the way to go
[SPEAKER_13]: because fewer resources, um, less material
that you end up using, less material
[SPEAKER_13]: you're wasting, um, no filters,
you know, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'd have to be sure that you weren't
contaminating, you know, once again,
[SPEAKER_19]: when we're talking about, I guess this is
the versus the commercial versus the,
[SPEAKER_19]: the small batch where you wouldn't want to
contaminate the oil with, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: the bottom, the, the end results of oil
squishing out and contaminating the plate
[SPEAKER_19]: where you come and you squish your next
one.
[SPEAKER_19]: And at the start, you clear off this oil
that was kind of leftover from the,
[SPEAKER_19]: the tail end of your last press.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's definitely more of a production,
you know, uh, I guess it would be more,
[SPEAKER_13]: more for production than actually high
quality, you know, product.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are always the two, uh, the,
the hardest two to marry to get,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, in symbiosis where you can opt
your, your, you know, commercialize your
[SPEAKER_19]: process, but without really lowering your
quality to, you know, noticeable levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, there's something maybe I can add to
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, actually, I've actually realized that
you can actually grow production level.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just only grow in one direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, as long as say your thickness,
or what your capita per ounce goes in only
[SPEAKER_08]: one direction should be able to increase
flow while maintaining the same quality
[SPEAKER_08]: that we're getting.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as soon as you start going this way
and that way with what you're putting in
[SPEAKER_08]: the plate, that's when your quality starts
to go down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's just because you, you,
you get, it's getting too hot or you're
[SPEAKER_19]: getting like, what, what's the main reason
behind that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, I think there's a limit to how
much plant material, uh, the rosin has to
[SPEAKER_07]: travel through to find its way outside of
the said filter being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_19]: The flow and the type of resin for that
matter as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like Phil was mentioning earlier about,
you know, the stuff that wants to butter
[SPEAKER_19]: up and not create that flow and just hold
tough, create a little plug in between
[SPEAKER_19]: itself and the screen versus the stuff
that just saps out upon touching it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't even really need much of a
pre-press and you just get this beautiful
[SPEAKER_19]: flow of rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's lots for us to learn about.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think Lindsay's correct in the sense
that a lot of this stuff needs to be
[SPEAKER_19]: tested.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like once LPs and other, you know,
federally legal entities are doing this on
[SPEAKER_19]: a level where you're, you're adding all
the data and with that data extrapolating
[SPEAKER_19]: and creating sort of a digital landscape
to lead you towards, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: better innovation and better
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really, really encourage everybody out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's playing with rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got enough material at hand,
um, just try some different crazy
[SPEAKER_04]: experiments that we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did one with, um, a vacuum bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sealed it in the vacuum bag,
some flour, and it came out white and it
[SPEAKER_04]: was, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, my yield was pretty poor, but I mean,
if we just keep playing with it and keep
[SPEAKER_04]: moving the, pushing this forward,
I think, I don't think anything can touch
[SPEAKER_04]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think from the THC A stuff we see now,
um, you know, it's such a diverse,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, form of extraction that I think
everyone in this room, we can all just
[SPEAKER_04]: keep pushing it like, like we've been
doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the more we explore the
boundaries, uh, you know, the better it
[SPEAKER_14]: gets, you know, that's exactly what we
have been doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's the reason why we are here at
such a quick rate.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you look at all these other
methods and how long it took to get to
[SPEAKER_14]: where they are, you know, and we've,
we've evolved in such a quick time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's because we, we, we, we
experiment, we try new things,
[SPEAKER_14]: we make mistakes, we, we observed the fact
that the mistake we made, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: it put us, put us to another level,
you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think exploring those boundaries and,
and, uh, you know, not being so close
[SPEAKER_14]: minded and thinking that, you know,
we've hit our max, you know, that's,
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we thought we were, you were done
making rosin, you know, like we couldn't
[SPEAKER_14]: believe it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then now, you know, we're,
we're actually mechanically separating THC
[SPEAKER_14]: A and the sauce fraction.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know?
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's next?
[SPEAKER_19]: Why don't we talk about that for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, um, you know, imagine people are
watching that have no idea on how to
[SPEAKER_19]: produce THC A using a rosin press and also
how to produce diamonds with a solventless
[SPEAKER_19]: sauce.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think it's just, uh,
it's a matter of just playing with
[SPEAKER_14]: temperature and, and, uh, time,
you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so, you just got to understand that,
you know, once, once a product has
[SPEAKER_14]: crystallized and nucleated or nucleated
and crystallized, now you have different
[SPEAKER_14]: melting points.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so understanding the melting points of
all the cannabinoids, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's, we have, as far as I've
gone, you know, I, I've just made,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, decent sauce and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's, I don't think it's at
its greatest yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's a lot of dialing in to do,
but I think it's just, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: pressing things out in fractions,
playing with material.
[SPEAKER_14]: You, you definitely have to experiment.
[SPEAKER_14]: You, you can listen to what everyone says
on how to do it and everything,
[SPEAKER_14]: but unless you're, you're playing with it
and doing it yourself and making the
[SPEAKER_14]: mistakes on your own, that's when you're
going to learn.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I mean, you know, I've read things,
I've read forums, I've read people doing
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff and, you know, I've tried things,
but it just gets you to a point.
[SPEAKER_14]: It leads you to the water, but you know,
it's a matter of you making that mistake
[SPEAKER_14]: on your own or, or trying something.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes you hit it first try.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes you don't, but, uh, you know,
as, as for making THCA, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Take some, you know, take, take some
degraded rosin or some buttered up rosin,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, press it at low temps,
gradually increase the high temps.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, you know, once you start doing
that, you'll really understand it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You kind of get an understanding of what
it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what's going to teach you,
you know, so you got to figure it out on
[SPEAKER_14]: your own.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think just listening to the way
everybody else does it is good because it
[SPEAKER_14]: gives you an idea, but trying things on
your own is what's going to get you to the
[SPEAKER_14]: way you do things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you just might find a better way than
everybody else that everybody else wants
[SPEAKER_14]: to listen to.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, you know, listen,
there's a lot of information on making it
[SPEAKER_14]: out there a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, it's pretty basic, but it's really,
it is a basic process.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nothing, nothing crazy about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not very, very technical.
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds like it, and it seems like it,
but, you know, patience is key when it
[SPEAKER_14]: comes to this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what most people don't have.
[SPEAKER_14]: They want instant results and that,
that you're not going to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's all about patience and, uh,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, that the basic drop really there
aside from, you know, figured out on your
[SPEAKER_19]: own is just the starting point is just
pressing a little bit of buttered out
[SPEAKER_19]: rosin or, you know, some rosin that you
have and low temp pressing it,
[SPEAKER_19]: raising the temp slowly, but surely to get
up to that point where you can see these
[SPEAKER_19]: fractions occur and you can extract.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that on your mic?
[SPEAKER_19]: The guy coughing?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, my bad.
[SPEAKER_18]: That is no, that that's okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause I was my, I muted every single
person.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm like, that mother fucker is still
coughing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Who the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I realized, oh, it's the only mic
I didn't mute, but you were talking at the
[SPEAKER_19]: time.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's fine.
[SPEAKER_19]: And don't worry.
[SPEAKER_19]: He, it sounds like he got a great rep and
that's what hash church is really all
[SPEAKER_19]: about.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, having a great rep and, uh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask a question real quick about the,
the solveless TSA stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you guys go about taking a dab once
you've, uh, caramelized it essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: like once you get it into those rocks,
like, and you, you put it into the jar and
[SPEAKER_00]: you dump the turps back on and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you like, like, how would you
take a dab if the rocks are bigger than
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to dab?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I don't, you seen my stuff,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got little pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine look like little aquarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people fucking stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the fuck they could dab though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to break my dabbers to get
into these rocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, how do I get a dab once you,
once these rocks are so huge?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, cause technically we, we,
we call them diamonds.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the name.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's THCA regardless, but I mean,
it's, it's harder than like crushing down
[SPEAKER_14]: a crystal that was grown, you know,
that's actually a crystal compared to us
[SPEAKER_14]: taking Christ, like microscopic crystals,
melting them down into an amorphous solid.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we're creating these boulders and
we're saturating them with the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when someone goes to break them,
they're hard, they shatter like glass and
[SPEAKER_14]: they get real hard to break up.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why I think, you know,
it looks really cool and all and it's
[SPEAKER_14]: great for the gram, but it's, it's,
that's really all it is when it comes to,
[SPEAKER_14]: to serving it out and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously you're going to have to break
that down, but I mean, for storage
[SPEAKER_14]: purposes, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you do like you did in that one
video though, you showed everybody that
[SPEAKER_00]: you could smash it into a fucking
gazillion pieces, but what if you did,
[SPEAKER_00]: you smash it down in that powder and then
you mix that powder into the Terps at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it's actually like dabble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can just get a regular dab of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that might be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, and at that point, dude,
it's like, you're, you're basically
[SPEAKER_14]: separating everything and, and if you do
that, you can crush it down and then add
[SPEAKER_14]: it back.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now you just have sugar again,
which you can make sugar.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there's techniques to make that
consistency and you can do that without
[SPEAKER_14]: separating everything and getting back to
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause all it is, is you're just making
that THCA back to a microscope,
[SPEAKER_14]: a microscopic scale.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's tiny, you know,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's, it's, it'd be better for,
for, for like smoking purposes,
[SPEAKER_14]: but as far as looks, you know,
people are, dude, they don't get to try it
[SPEAKER_14]: or smell it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, you're going to make it as
appealing as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it still look good though?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've, you've caramelized it to
the point where it's going to stay glassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that it will break down
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, wouldn't it still kind of look
good mixed in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're still going to be crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be like the regular
sugars that we're making pressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, no, I mean, I think it does look
good, but you know, people are so hyped up
[SPEAKER_14]: on this sauce, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and they got to understand it's not
the same stuff as, like these BHO
[SPEAKER_14]: extractions, you know, you get more of a
less viscous sauce.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can get it to run when it's nice and
warm.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people are getting their,
their extraction on the term fraction
[SPEAKER_14]: down.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can't say that, that, you know,
you can't get some real viscous sauce at a
[SPEAKER_14]: cool temp, but you know, over time it
starts to sugar up and it depends on your
[SPEAKER_14]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why patience is important.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the quicker you are with it,
then you'll notice your sauce lights to
[SPEAKER_14]: sugar back up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause you're with those terpenes and that
THCA present.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or with the terpenes present, that THCA
comes out with no problem through the
[SPEAKER_14]: screen at a lower temp.
[SPEAKER_14]: So even though it has a higher melting
point, the terpenes are, they have some
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of reaction with the THCA that's
allowing it to dissolve through or not
[SPEAKER_14]: dissolve because it's not actually
dissolved, but to push through.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, you know, being slow with that and
getting the most volatile part out,
[SPEAKER_14]: which are your terpenes, getting those out
slow, low and slow, you know, patience,
[SPEAKER_14]: that's going to be a key part.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, uh, I mean, as far as like packaging
and looks and, and consumption wise,
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah, I think having small, if you want
like rocks or like diamonds, keep them
[SPEAKER_14]: small.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that way it's easy to get at least a
dab size, you know, or you can break it
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's not going to shatter into all
these pieces everywhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be easier to, uh,
to fucking dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I noticed some people really put
boulders in these fucking jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, man, how the fuck are
you going to get a dab without breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar or your dapper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how is this going to work?
[SPEAKER_14]: So for the, the THCA by itself,
I like to, uh, I like to leave those big
[SPEAKER_14]: though.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: No.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, actually this last batch I did was
all little pebbles, but like one batch I
[SPEAKER_14]: did, I just left them all as like,
you know, half gram chunks.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I realized it's just like,
man, it's a pain in the ass to dab on that
[SPEAKER_14]: shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like if you really want to dab,
it's like you broke the whole thing down
[SPEAKER_14]: to powder just to get one little piece
that you can actually fucking put in the
[SPEAKER_14]: fucking rig, you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all about looks, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have, the first thing is always
presentation.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, when you have the most
appealing thing in the crowd, that's what
[SPEAKER_14]: people are going to grab where they're
going to, they're going to be happier with
[SPEAKER_14]: that, or they're going to be happier with
the person who decided that that is not
[SPEAKER_14]: the best route to go.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is, you know, cause they've
already been there, done that,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, it's just, it's that's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: People got to learn on the road.
[SPEAKER_14]: That it sucks, you know, this is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know some people will take big
enough dabs and they would just drop a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole diamond in there, but I'm not that
fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just want a normal dab and I don't
want to have to work for it with a pick
[SPEAKER_00]: and an ax and getting crazy.
[SPEAKER_19]: I kind of wanted to ask everyone what they
thought to, as we just kind of come out
[SPEAKER_19]: the third hour here of the present,
what do you guys feel about the future of
[SPEAKER_19]: Rosin?
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, where, where are we headed?
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, obviously we heard Lindsay earlier
say that he wants to see robots filling
[SPEAKER_19]: the, the unit, which is definitely one
unique perspective for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: But where, where do we see the future of
Rosin?
[SPEAKER_19]: Where's this going to go?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this going to, is this going to be
become the new pharma grade quality
[SPEAKER_19]: medicinal raw product for all of these
different products that are going to be
[SPEAKER_19]: available in the medicinal world?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it going to become what's that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said a while ago, you know,
I feel like it's going to be the standard
[SPEAKER_14]: of extraction, you know, people are
understanding that they can get,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the same quality resin and you
know, whether they want to separate it,
[SPEAKER_14]: you might not be growing crystals,
but I mean, we can pull sauce.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can have THCA separated from the
terpene fraction.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can get yields similar to, if not the
same.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see why eventually, you know,
anybody in their mind wouldn't think of
[SPEAKER_14]: possibly converting or going in that
route.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or people that are new or coming onto the
scene that that's going to be the number
[SPEAKER_14]: one option that they're going to go for.
[SPEAKER_14]: I see it being the future and the biggest
extraction method in the future for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Most, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the, uh, the way the world's
going right now with everyone becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: more health conscious, becoming more aware
of what they eat and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start to realize the same
thing with the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if you put the concentrates in
front of people on a table and you asked
[SPEAKER_00]: them, okay, this one's maybe with heat and
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was made with water ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was made with just shaking the boat
and this one's made with butane gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody in their right mind is not going
to pick the butane gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never taken a dab in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say, what, what do you
mean you made it with butane gas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that for lighters?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be someone's response in
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the more newcomers that come
are going to be less likely wanting to dab
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I mean, I've already seen a lot of
people convert and they don't dab PHO at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, believers of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was at one time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can change, I feel like a lot of
people can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely agree with what you're
saying, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I seen right there, Elysium put
solventless sauce carts.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's definitely the future.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's great because you know what?
[SPEAKER_14]: I have not come out with the pen for the
fact that I'm not going to use vegetable
[SPEAKER_14]: glycerin or propylene glyosol or,
you know, just any of these fillers.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, I've wanted to have a
solventless pen, but it has it
[SPEAKER_14]: solventless.
[SPEAKER_14]: It might be solventless, but you're
adding, you know, fillers into that shit,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: So, so to actually fractionally separate
this shit and then, you know, you can go
[SPEAKER_14]: from that process and now you'll be able
to make solventless carts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause now you have those fractions
separate for you to manipulate and do
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever's necessary to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like a lot of new people who
might come into the industry are going to
[SPEAKER_13]: be sort of more prone to using pens
because just the access and how easy it
[SPEAKER_13]: actually is and the discreteness,
you know, and everything else that comes
[SPEAKER_13]: along with it, I think.
[SPEAKER_13]: So in general, I feel like that is going
to take up a huge portion of the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for Canada, it's going to be huge
here in Canada with the LP market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're not accepting anything
other than CO2 extractions right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a demand here for dabs and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And being that legalization is coming,
it's most definitely going to be the
[SPEAKER_06]: leading extract here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just look at the price of the CO2 machine
compared to the Rosamund.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know exactly millions of dollars on
giant systems.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, with the hair straightener,
you can make a, you know, it just blows my
[SPEAKER_10]: mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I seen a CO2, it did a 40 pounds in five
hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, we can get,
we can give Rosamund there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can make a press or multiple presses or
a stacked press or some variation of a
[SPEAKER_04]: press to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's going to be, yeah,
there's going to be Rosamund extraction
[SPEAKER_06]: for use of capsules and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's going to be more of a,
you know, of a art craft approach to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, you know, both aspects will
be very beneficial for the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you compare it to the beer
industry, you know, you got your Bud
[SPEAKER_05]: Lights and your Coors Lights, and then you
got your Sierra Nevadas and a Sierra
[SPEAKER_05]: Nevada's grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of gone a little closer to Bud
Light.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you got your true, you know,
classy blue color.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Logonetus, for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then beyond that, you have your craft
ales and your sours, those real specialty
[SPEAKER_05]: items.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think rosin is going to be able to
provide, you know, for every demographic.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you, if you want to dab and your only
criteria is that there's no gas in it,
[SPEAKER_05]: no solvent in it, well then you might be a
Bud Light rosin guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you like to drink six beers
or drink six, you know, pale ales,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe you want to, maybe you want some
really good flower rosin that's kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: middle of the road where you're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe you have a special occasion,
you want to bust open that sour you've
[SPEAKER_05]: been talking to your friend about and,
you know, get down on some whole plant
[SPEAKER_05]: fresh frozen, you know, you know,
unicorn rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think there's no reason that
products made with solvents really are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to have a long stay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think rosin is definitely the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think as people start to get a
little more open minded and realize that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not just what everybody was saying a
year ago or just what these people are
[SPEAKER_05]: saying now that it's this whole culture
and practice that's going to grow and
[SPEAKER_05]: evolve.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're going to see a lot of people
stand out with, you know, their own
[SPEAKER_05]: method.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're also going to see a lot
of people jump in, I think, trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: copycat what's trendy, like, okay,
I'm going to harvest everything early.
[SPEAKER_05]: My hash has to be clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: My hash has to be white.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like, man, what about the guy who
grew it organic?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it go 12 weeks, you know, see water,
you know, water at the end of its life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it presses out some beautiful,
beautiful maple syrup color, fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: rosin, like, it's, it's, uh, yeah,
I just, I just think it's just going to
[SPEAKER_05]: take a little time and that we all have to
keep, you know, just doing, doing what we
[SPEAKER_05]: do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to be able to show people,
you know, we have to, we have to be
[SPEAKER_05]: ambassadors to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to show people our products and
not just try and sell them on our way of
[SPEAKER_05]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as a whole, a whole solventless
culture, I think, I think we can
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely take some tips from,
uh, how the beer industry does it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we should all kind of decide where we
want to stand with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, sometimes you like a
Pilsner, sometimes you like an ale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Occasionally, I like this kind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I show up to somebody else's house
and all their servant is Bud Light,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, fuck, I'll have four of them,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scale up to large production and maintain
quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's quality and quality oats.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you, if you're using good, good
flowers, good hashing, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_04]: it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just a matter of how big you want
the scale to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I, I don't personally like the taste
of a lot of CO2 stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but improperly, it tastes great,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think scaling it up with quality in
mind, it's, it's, it's going to be easy to
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's, it's the future.
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Compassion made it into the room.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right at the end.
[SPEAKER_18]: You made it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I here?
[SPEAKER_15]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry everybody for being late.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, totally appreciate, uh, what all you
guys do.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, especially coming from where I came
from.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, you can't even almost call it rosin
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's completely different.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, uh, but the work you guys do,
uh, the knowledge you share.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's really what it's about for
me as far as the whole cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, uh, what, what's next?
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we make it better?
[SPEAKER_15]: What's w who's doing what and where can we
turn the corner and be curious,
[SPEAKER_15]: right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that was always my thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was, okay, this is so awesome as it is
right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, why don't you give everyone a little
bit of history of when you came up with
[SPEAKER_19]: that post and how you kind of came up with
it and explain to them, like they've never
[SPEAKER_19]: even heard the story that, uh,
you know, you, from my perspective,
[SPEAKER_19]: you're the first person I ever saw on a
cannabis forum talk about rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it seems to go back to, does it go
back before 2006?
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, I think it was 2005 was when I really
started working on it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, I wanted to do a lot of research
on it.
[SPEAKER_15]: First checking out a bunch of books,
seeing information online.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I didn't want to say, Oh,
I'm making a new product when somebody
[SPEAKER_15]: else, you know, maybe already had done
that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, basically my background, uh,
I was always into hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: I grew up in the Kootenays and the Nelson
area.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, I don't know if you guys know
that area.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty legendary for its,
uh, top notch, uh, strains and extractions
[SPEAKER_15]: and all types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I started making hash at about 14,
15.
[SPEAKER_15]: Years of age.
[SPEAKER_15]: I even just, it was like, we wanted to get
a buzz.
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we get a buzz for free?
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're kids.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'd get shake and we'd rub it over a
screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was like, Hey, it was good for
them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, and people were like, Oh,
you got to use bud.
[SPEAKER_15]: You got to use bud, blah, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were like, no, look at this stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just from, just from the leaves.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and so I went through a lot of
different processes, trying to press,
[SPEAKER_15]: trying to stick cash together and stuff
like that, using oil as a median to put
[SPEAKER_15]: big bricks together and stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, and then the quality just started
showing up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like everybody's quality of trim.
[SPEAKER_15]: People were taking care of the buds,
cheering everything better.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, and then I was seeing a better
result of hash that I was getting.
[SPEAKER_15]: So my method was a bowl with heat from
steam.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would just take my hash powder,
the Keefe, and I would dump it in there
[SPEAKER_15]: and I would just sort of smear it with a
spoon until it would stick together.
Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I have that busted out into the
grams and, and go from there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but as the quality got really good,
I started seeing this film build on the
[SPEAKER_15]: bowl and, and I kind of was like,
Oh, it's just wax or whatever,
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of wrote it off and sort of mixed it
back in the best I could.
[SPEAKER_15]: And until, uh, when I was working at the
Vicks and, uh, and the great grower,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, gardener, pardon me, uh, product was
coming in and this one batch, I think it
[SPEAKER_15]: was the imposter and the shit just glued
right to the side of my bowl.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, what the hell's going on
here?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, this is something more.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I scraped all the powder off and got it
to just that film and didn't have a razor
[SPEAKER_15]: blade or anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I wasn't into oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was making full melt hashes all the
time.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I used a butter knife and scraped
enough of this stuff off the side of the
[SPEAKER_15]: bowl and threw it in my pipe, took a puff
and I almost passed out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause it was just, it was so much stronger
that I was used to, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like activating these new neurons
in my brain that were just waiting for
[SPEAKER_15]: this new cannabis, euphoria experience.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, first thing I did is went over to
a buddy's house.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, gotta check this shit out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like here's the hash gave him the hash
first and it melted.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're probably talking four star hash for
my second screening.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I was like, try this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he did the same thing, coughed his
brains out and almost passed out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were like, there's something going
on here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, getting back to all the research
that I did, the most thing I, the only
[SPEAKER_15]: thing I really found, I forget what book
it was mentioned was, uh, vitamin Clark's,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it was how they would produce in one
of the hash countries.
[SPEAKER_15]: They would press and press and press.
[SPEAKER_15]: And after a full day of pressing,
there would be this little bit of red oil
[SPEAKER_15]: left on the press that they would collect.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was their sort of potent real.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that was rosin really is exactly
what it was.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but it wasn't, uh, it was considered
like a by-product of like pressing pounds
[SPEAKER_15]: and pounds of hash, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: So it wasn't necessarily a feasible
product to bring to market.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so all I did was started figuring out
how to just take the cream off and get
[SPEAKER_15]: production.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking 5%.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, look at this.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got a gram of rosin.
[SPEAKER_15]: I spent two hours and I got a nice gram of
puk of rosin.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can see all that on my IC mag
account as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, uh, but once I got it all together
and I figured it was worthy calling a new
[SPEAKER_15]: name because it was a new process for
extracting something from hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was giving people a dab experience
without having to go to isopropanol at the
[SPEAKER_15]: time, which was probably being used a lot
more, um, or butane and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But my props definitely go to,
uh, the good growers, like the great
[SPEAKER_15]: gardener and the people at the fix and,
and, uh, the groundbreaking, uh,
[SPEAKER_15]: work that was done there to just sort of
bring it all to all of this in a way,
[SPEAKER_15]: the dispensary paving the way for
dispensaries, uh, salt extract,
[SPEAKER_15]: a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm rambling on a little nervous.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, dude, you, that was stellar.
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly, I was kind of bummed out that
you weren't making it in at the start.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was really like, man, what will this
show be without compassion telling us
[SPEAKER_19]: about the OG Rosin, uh, uh, host?
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember the photo that you had posted,
which I obviously will have to post here
[SPEAKER_19]: as well, which was, uh, you had posted a
few of them.
[SPEAKER_19]: This one in particular was very,
very just, it was a powerful image.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember because I felt like I was one
of the only few people at the time taking
[SPEAKER_19]: pictures of really melty resin with,
with powerful macro lenses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you posted just a few pictures,
but one of them caught my eye.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like nobody's business.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just trying to think if it's in,
I know when you're talking about the best
[SPEAKER_15]: word for it, I think is provocative.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's just so like, what is that
stuff?
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, like, and especially back then,
cause I mean, you were doing the
[SPEAKER_15]: groundbreaking for the bubble hash,
uh, water extraction and, and bringing the
[SPEAKER_15]: higher quality, uh, resins to the picture
that didn't have to be made with a solvent
[SPEAKER_15]: petrochemical solvents.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_15]: She's a beauty.
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like eggs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I, I, right away I was like,
wow, the melt quality on this is next
[SPEAKER_19]: level.
[SPEAKER_19]: I definitely have to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, it was sweet to be able to see,
uh, to see it, the process and the time at
[SPEAKER_19]: the time that you released it,
it was great because as I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_19]: when I first released the bags,
I didn't realize it at the time,
[SPEAKER_19]: but it was the small percentage of people.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I was always amazed people that
had never made hash in their life would
[SPEAKER_19]: just send me a picture of basically what
would be known as the greatest quality.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hash in the world, no matter who you are.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they'd be just Joe blow nobody.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the next day they'd be like one of the
greatest hash makers on the planet because
[SPEAKER_19]: they had the fire material, but that was a
very, very small percentage of people.
[SPEAKER_19]: And many of the people who used my bags
got two and three and maybe four star,
[SPEAKER_19]: but, but the elusive five and six stars
just, just weren't there for them.
[SPEAKER_19]: So when you released this method,
I thought it was going to catch on a lot
[SPEAKER_19]: more than it actually did because it kind
of was exciting and people were doing it,
[SPEAKER_19]: but it didn't really catch on the way,
the way I thought it would, you know?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it was a lot of work, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: And the time it took and everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, and that's why, you know,
if you go through the posts that I did do
[SPEAKER_15]: about it, uh, that it was always like,
Hey, I get it.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not the best method, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like this is, I'm sharing this because
there's something here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if anybody figures out a better way,
then share that information for us,
[SPEAKER_15]: right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause, cause this is for us, you know,
we, let's put a patent on it or a
[SPEAKER_15]: trademark or whatever and control it.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, no, that's not what this plant is
about.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about sharing and furthering all of
our knowledge about it, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the biggest.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's what, uh, you know,
publishing and putting the information out
[SPEAKER_19]: to the public that once you've previously
published something, it's no longer
[SPEAKER_19]: patentable.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that, you know, that that's the best
way to do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to, I mean, it sure made sense
with water hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: I, how was I ever going to, I'll sell
people bags if they, if I wouldn't,
[SPEAKER_19]: didn't tell them how to use them.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got these bags and if you figure it out,
you might get something really good,
[SPEAKER_19]: but I'm not going to be showing you how to
do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would be a little bit ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Having you give us that historical
context.
[SPEAKER_19]: So 2005, and was it overgrown that you
posted it on first?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it was definitely on overgrow.
[SPEAKER_15]: I reposted it onto ICMAG just because of
what happened with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: OG forums there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to make sure that that
knowledge was still out there for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, again, you guys have helped take it to
a whole other level and, uh, I'm super
[SPEAKER_15]: grateful being in a market that's
saturated with petrochemical based,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, solvent based extractions,
you know, like, uh, to be able to have
[SPEAKER_15]: very cheap materials at home, to be able
to press out some things that I can have
[SPEAKER_15]: some smoke is huge to me, you know,
like, cause I was still, rubbing some buds
[SPEAKER_15]: in a screen, pressing some of that out,
you know, like on my bowl.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I'm like, I want to dab and,
and, and dabbing is totally where it's at.
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember the, uh, the Hashmaster cut
little dab rig, you know, I got one
[SPEAKER_15]: somewhere packed away and, and we were
doing that shit 10 years ago at that time
[SPEAKER_15]: as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, we all sort of one step,
we all work together to create a bigger
[SPEAKER_15]: picture and, and, and, and a masterpiece
really over time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Props to all you guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, that's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am beyond stoked that you managed to
make it in 777 people watching right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why I like that number,
but I do.
[SPEAKER_19]: I get the idea that solving this mind
would like that number as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't be wrong.
[SPEAKER_19]: You like that number?
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, listen, guys, that was really quite
an incredible, uh, episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you guys feel that you want to talk
more, I can, I, and there's things that we
[SPEAKER_19]: haven't talked about.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't mind, uh, leaving you to it for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_19]: Otherwise, I think I'm going to call it,
uh, call it a day and thank everyone for
[SPEAKER_19]: coming in and being a part of,
uh, the past, present and future of Ross
[SPEAKER_19]: and hash church 2.0 episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe we could do another episode where we
make it more about tech and the things
[SPEAKER_19]: that we actually want to share.
[SPEAKER_19]: We can really just go into a full tech
episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know people were like, oh, this is just
a circle jerk.
[SPEAKER_19]: It really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was important for everyone to get the
perspective and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: to, to get to know each person on the
panel.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, maybe we'll plan in the next
month or two, uh, full Ross and tech,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'll invite you guys all back.
[SPEAKER_19]: If that sounds like something you would
like to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So yes, uh, soil grown, obviously huge
thanks to you and the Sasquatch family for
[SPEAKER_19]: coming out and sharing and leading the
way.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, my boys over at maple butter on the
East coast of things here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_19]: For their artesian butter in my bowl.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, thanks Lindsey for coming out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks Lindsey for coming out for evolved
cannabis as well as, uh, honey butter,
[SPEAKER_19]: dude, I'm still blown away by your photos
and the quality of the work that you do.
[SPEAKER_19]: Solventless mind, always a pleasure and
Elysian research.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, compassion.
[SPEAKER_19]: You really finished it off perfectly for
me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't have finished this episode
without your story.
[SPEAKER_19]: So thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_19]: May the full melt bless your bowl sooner
than you think.
[SPEAKER_19]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
Okay.
