[SPEAKER_00]: Full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ready to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just here with the originator,
as many know, the soil girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Phil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hanging out in this hot day,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: High times, cannabis coke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better than rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot better than the rain,
but it's gonna get a lot better once it
[SPEAKER_01]: starts to cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we were talking on Hashturch
about how many events they were having in
[SPEAKER_00]: a row, and now doesn't it feel better to
just kind of have like, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a SoCal and a NorthCal just two a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, most definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, it gets watered down
having it so often, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to them every week,
and it just starts to burn it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it becomes more of a reward
getting to go to these things every so
[SPEAKER_01]: often.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows us to network, and it's almost
like a little retreat, like if you do it
[SPEAKER_00]: the right way, which this time was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was many days here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got three days, and then you
kind of get to interact with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and then different people in your
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: By third day, which is today, it's like
I'm kind of going around and being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: kick it with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree 100%, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having like the two-day events or the
one-day events, they're cool and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, you get so stuck at
the booth on those first days,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first day, one and two, and it's just
like, you don't really get to network or
[SPEAKER_01]: meet the people that you were looking for
you wanted to meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That third day, it's important,
I feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for that part of the event,
the networking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my favorite day because I get to
sample everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people also don't know,
you also make hash rosin, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, yeah, and water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water hash, so not just flour rosin.
No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were showing off a little bit
earlier over here, and so pick out your,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had to give me your best dab of the
hash rosin, or say just of your,
[SPEAKER_00]: say resin category and oil category,
because anything that's pressed hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, would be oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me your best hash and give me your
best oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing some dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get the, let's get the 159 through
73 OG glue, bubble hash, and then let's do
[SPEAKER_01]: the orange cookies, OG glue, live rosin,
flour rosin blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to blend the rosins too,
you know, so rather than just,
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than just having a, you know,
flour rosin or live rosin or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just one specific strain, having the oils
and being able to blend, I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: create, you're basically able to kind of
create your own flavor in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you, are you actually mixing the
flour rosin and the hash rosin together?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I haven't really played with
doing the live rosin or the hash rosin and
[SPEAKER_01]: the flour rosin mixes, but I mean,
they work really well because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: times the hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just talking about this the other
day, because we made a, why we call it our
[SPEAKER_00]: grease is we're taking bubble hash rosin
with terpenes, and then there's flour
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin with terpenes, and they're
distinctively two different, totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the texture to the, you know,
the visual to the, to the experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as taste too, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all kind of, I was talking with
Frenchy last night too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone that's really into, you know,
into their own, into their own like type
[SPEAKER_00]: of making a hash like chefs, you know,
it's like if I was Italian chef and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: a French chef, you know, and you,
and you like establish yourself as chefs
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're kind of creating your own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an art.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's like an art, you know,
it's because that's where it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it takes that creative mind to take
the steps to play with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you go out of the box,
you try new things rather than following
[SPEAKER_01]: what you learned and what you,
what you think is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you explore, you know, and that's
what's fun about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And meeting the other people and all the
others that are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we know you're making
creations, what, what'd you pick out for
[SPEAKER_00]: me to try?
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange cookies is up first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right here, we got some orange cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the orange cookies, flour rosin
blended with the OG glue live rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And explain live rosin to, to the
audience, what that is exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you, what exactly are you doing
that makes that live rosin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, we are not pressing fresh
frozen buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work when you press fresh
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some people may have some
techniques or tricks to it, but as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: like the best ways and the most common way
that's going to end up sticking,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say is going to be to wash the
fresh frozen into a, to a water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drying it and then pressing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's really, that's what live
rosin is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really fresh, frozen, full melt,
pressed into rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wash and squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's as close as live rosin you
can get for the, for the rosin side,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what was that orange cookies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted like an orange soda with like
hints of sugar cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that tastes more like a,
that tastes more like a really clean hash
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool way that you combine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt it to my front of my head,
like right away too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have you try the OG glue that's ice
wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to try the ice wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish you were here, Marcus,
but somebody's got a host.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's on the other end of that Marcus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's got to fill in the role.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, he needs somebody to do bubble
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like world tour here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I volunteered to be the host to try
everyone's dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm taking it upon myself to try all
the dabs that he would be trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your OG ice wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one's for you B man.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG ice wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's for the B man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocking that soul grown dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's immediately so much stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hash hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the water hash definitely has
the most expansion on the lungs and almost
[SPEAKER_01]: a more full spectrum high rather than just
like the flour rising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noticeable is like when you smoke hash and
people think of chalice old school ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking hash, you're generating a lot of
carbon, a lot of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the flower live rosin,
really clean, a lot of less, a lot of less
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a different way of expanding the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a pure way to hit the
collapillaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one hashes like a little bit more
smoky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it blows it up and gives you that old
school expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't need as much smoke, but we're used
to taking the same size hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we take that same hit and it hits
us harder because we're used to a cleaner
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing oil, it's yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's less contaminant, less carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people like that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do is when I heat my quartz
or silicone carbide or have it on my nail
[SPEAKER_00]: or something, the most important thing is
that when you're anytime you're dabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: full moon, you press it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always bring it into where the heat
source is, test the side of whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: element dish that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it starts to nicely melt and bubble
right there, then you know the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: is right to go ahead and drop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it fall into the rest of the dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see any kind of burn or a little
browning, that's an indication to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: back and wait and wait 15 seconds or more
and then try it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it hits the side of that dish and
it starts to bubble, then you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: have the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I'll do often times
when I'm like, I'm about to do a dab and I
[SPEAKER_01]: forget like the time or how long I was
counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, I'll give it a little tap
and it kind of gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, you see that little tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just stays nice and clear oil rather
than charring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think people don't
understand or appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: First run, 30 second or one minute
agitation runs, getting the first most
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful array of trichomes is that first
shaking of the tree to get those trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: in one first wash, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get that and you're looking
for this five or six star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get that, you're getting these
like voluptuous like on a macro level
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes, these perfectly preserved heads
that are fitting a certain screen size on
[SPEAKER_00]: the first agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a delicacy and it's expensive and
you've got to take smaller dabs pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: out thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to be able to do that dab
test with any kind of heat source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you can actually have this
medicine last a lot longer and appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those short runs, you're capturing
those heads that dissolve the fastest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you want to get those in short,
quick runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's how you're going to
capture a lot of those terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in the water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, I really appreciate
the way that you're also looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and how you're preserving them in
your process, whether we're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the times when people,
you know, the collaboration really that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing is we're using the Sasquatch
V1 and the V2 with a California air now
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in a complete, but it's in a
silence box and it has a flow adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time you hit, it keeps that 80 on
the pedal and it kind of hits the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: time and there's no sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that allows us to control the plate
temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always shut the top one off or
keep it to a hundred and the other one at
[SPEAKER_00]: 180.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even with flower rosin to simulate the
effect of the V1, because there's certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I like about the V1,
especially with hash is that colder plate
[SPEAKER_00]: on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it down-temping allows it to do
something different than having a constant
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see, that's like, that's the
experimentation with like each individual
[SPEAKER_01]: artist themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they decide to go, well,
I'm going to try this instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking to the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's beautiful about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we stumble upon these
new, new textures and just new,
[SPEAKER_01]: new versions of the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, that's what's great about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited for what's to come with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a really strong fam and the
Sasquatch is doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use it for Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use it for a bubble man Blue River
collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thoroughly enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stand by the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, when you're pushing pounds
and pressing pounds all day long over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over and over, that's when you
find out if you have something that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most definitely, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's built to allow us to be artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the beast, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's for production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for boutique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for however you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this machine, you can manipulate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's full control.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to press water hash and you
need to press very, very slow,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can lower the PSI on your
compressor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have full control of the speed
as well as the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's as well as the
strength of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so whatever you want to press,
if you want to throw in a quarter pound
[SPEAKER_01]: and you want to go crazy, you can do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that's a whole nother,
that's a whole nother ball game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have production level and
you have more of a connoisseur level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it artisanal or boutique because
we always do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we finally were able to get some of
our stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, we've got 50 grams of a Jack
Frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were jumping up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hundred and a half grams just
because it's trying to get that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality into production is really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we didn't have a Sasquatch and a
team and kind of dialed us in for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, we wouldn't be able to start getting
into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's hard sometimes when you're like
an artist and you get stumbled upon with
[SPEAKER_00]: your tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I have to give my hats off to
like using the right tools makes it a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to be able to develop these
different types of new techniques as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think tools are an important part of the
trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having proper tools, having the right
resources allows you to have an advantage
[SPEAKER_01]: in this part of the industry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the most important part
is the quality of the herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's like, oh, I got this like trim
with like smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you press this out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, I mean, I really want to
take the oranges from the tree when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're ripe and perfect big oranges,
not these little baby ones or not the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that got rotten and fell to the ground or
not just the peels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you're only as good as the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you got the tools down,
you got the skills down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody doesn't give you good
flowers, there's nothing you can do about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole nother part of the game is
being a turp hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got to find that quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people claim that to have it
and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, it's really not that easy to
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really got to look around and you got
to look past all the bullshit and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is a lot of hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I talk to farmers, you're like,
so what did it test?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I didn't test that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, all right, well, when you do,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me all the reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test a couple different batches of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are really, that's like super
important, especially when you're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, I look at this as a tester as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, give me an ounce of your
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've passed all of your pesticides
and microbes and everything, like cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me an ounce of your material if I
press it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's wrong with the recipe.
It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't always blame the grower
because there's a lot of times where,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance, this, the Sunny D,
I mean, it only put out 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other strains I got from the
grower, I mean, I hit as far as like 25%,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, there's phenomenal strains,
but some strains just don't produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: oil or the heads just don't feel,
they just don't feel like the others,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they could be, when you look at
sometimes there's different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties where there are stocks that line
up in perfect grids and they're spaced
[SPEAKER_00]: with bigger heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's stocks that line up very
tightly and take up every space with tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go to wash resin,
it's very hard because it'd be like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon tree that was solid, full of lemons
on the outside that made it harder for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these little tiny heads can come
off like almost like harder raisins,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get into something like this,
I found the moisture content, the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the length, the heat, you could get pretty
good at trying to get what you can out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but it is like a fruit that sometimes
doesn't want to be squished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to find different ways and
uses of those varieties or they get phased
[SPEAKER_00]: out from using.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working for concentrates and
it's not working for you and that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: you do, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do it for flowers, sometimes
those flowers are very enjoyable just
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't produce as much oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was in the orange soda?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it tasted like an orange zesty
soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the orange cookies and the
flower rosin blended with the OG glue live
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG glue live rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do, did you enter anything into
the?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, it was really short notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I knew this was coming, but I wasn't
sure whether or not I was going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been real busy with like a lot of the
other projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of scrounged to get stuff ready
for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was like a last minute thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Staying up till late in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barely sleeping, barely eating,
knocking it out just to be here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely I'm going to be entering in
some of these events this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, much respect as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
