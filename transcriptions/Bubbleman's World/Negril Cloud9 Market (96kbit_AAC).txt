Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the perfect time to start it as
you just were given your cannabis infused
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothie.
[SPEAKER_00]: A milkshake actually, an Oreo milkshake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting on the cliffs in that grill at
my old buddy Randy's old ice cream shop
[SPEAKER_00]: that I guess is owned by Terry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is owned by Terry, who we just met?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Terry and Marlon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Marlon, alright, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at this ice cream shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have probably seen me film here
in the past and I'll probably give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little zoom in on the camera and show you
exactly where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm here today with Mohammed from
Cloud9.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him a couple of days ago at the
Tomorrow Today Festival that I was brought
[SPEAKER_00]: out here for to speak on the 5th,
tomorrow on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, well I guess we linked up a
couple days ago, shared some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of told me a little bit about what
you were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We vibed well and since then we've hung
out a couple more times, shared more dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: and learned a little bit more about what
we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, this video is actually about
letting Mohammed tell you a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about his business that he's got going on
here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's definitely got something special
going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll leave it to you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on here in Jamaica with
Mohammed and Cloud9?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, man, me and my wife, man,
we came here from love.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got married here and we just decided
that this is what we want to be and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is where we want to start our family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't know what we want to do,
but we know what we love and we love her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we figured out what way can we give
back and we can make people feel good and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have health benefits at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started an edible company and we
didn't really just start it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just started making edibles for
personal use and people like them and we
[SPEAKER_01]: just started giving them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about your edibles,
not to cut you off, but like what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: doses are you putting in each one of these
edibles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're running it from 25,
50 and 100 milligram doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: To order, we do preferred doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and you got, I see you got some
brownies and some cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some M&M brownies right here with
some M&M's inside and we have some
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate chip cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're ital, vegan, and we have some
almond brownies and they're vegan as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have a marijuana infused
milkshake or cannabis infused milkshake,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oreo milkshake that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make a lot of different ice cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ice cream is our best product actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just had a little ice cream here,
but it wasn't cannabis infused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about the bud too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that you've really, you've
connected with some growers that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: and some that I don't I'm sure,
but it seems like you've really like,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud that I held up to the camera a
second ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a beautiful, hazy,
like narrow leaf drug cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa, call it whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just absolute fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the same bud that you gave Jesse
Royal earlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse Royal got a piece and Cody J got a
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we bumped into Jesse Royal recently at
the Tomorrow Today Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spoke and we just stopped him and
pulled him in and asked him if he wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he did want some flour that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him a little bit of Waba's flour
and then Mohamed gave him a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: this flour and he was quite excited about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool to know that you got that herb
that the artists themselves, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's that artist herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the highest caliber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, people love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I love to know that it's grown
organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use this herb to infuse our edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has to be grown organically and we
get it tested from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us about your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know nothing secretive,
but whatever like generally like how are
[SPEAKER_00]: you infusing your edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your process?
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to thank the Magic Butter Machine
and definitely we're infusing it with RSO
[SPEAKER_00]: or a nice quick wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're making an extract and then
you're using an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of tell because the cookie
just would not be the color of a cookie if
[SPEAKER_00]: he had used cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's definitely like a good
place to be where you're using like an oil
[SPEAKER_00]: or hash, you know, or distilled or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: To use as your starting process rather
than flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it just ends up all that chlorophyll
and all that greenery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sort of produces something that's
not quite as nice as what we hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome herb, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get to go see protege later on
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're probably gonna sit here and take a
dab or two, I would think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well I bet you we could push through
and make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to let you guys take a look at
our menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is your menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have a lot of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can follow our Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I can actually do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take this and I can photograph it
and then I can put it over top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen and you can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to talk about this page
right now we could show it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so this right here would be our
marijuana pizza we actually make and we
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually infuse that with a nice
olive oil or we do it if people want a
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared garlic butter on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do french fries, mac and cheese,
nachos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have five different types of ice
cream, chocolate chips, chocolate,
[SPEAKER_01]: vanilla, mango, and banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have coffee, natural juices,
bottle drinks, and milkshakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those are infused with our nice
marijuana honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the other side you have this
beautiful cannabis edibles cloud nine
[SPEAKER_00]: menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got all sorts of different
things going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you can find this place,
you can find menus at multiple locations
[SPEAKER_01]: in the grill and you can come to Patsy's
here on West End.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the best ice cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come check them out at a nice
Amsterdam style setting place where we can
[SPEAKER_01]: have our lounge and have a coffee in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our menus are in Bourbon Beach as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can come to Bourbon Beach and you
can have a good time at Bourbon and order
[SPEAKER_01]: some cannabis ice cream and you can find
it at Banana Shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, listen, you guys are always
obviously asking me where you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked up in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be pointing everyone towards
this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So easy enough to get in touch with these
guys.

nine underscore green market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that'll be I'll put that in the

[SPEAKER_00]: So locally it's eight six five zero eight
three nine.

seven six eight six five zero eight three
