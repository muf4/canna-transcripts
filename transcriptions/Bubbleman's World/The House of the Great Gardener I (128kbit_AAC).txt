[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, good morning everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 6.30 in the morning right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pitch black outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm about to head over to Vancouver
Island.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all going to go over to the ferries
in Horseshoe Bay which will lead us over
[SPEAKER_06]: to Nanaimo and then we're going to drive
down into Duncan and we'll be at our
[SPEAKER_06]: destination.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you guys are ready for a pretty
awesome trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go see these great
gardeners and they really know what
[SPEAKER_06]: they're doing over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a seed crop hanging.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a bunch of hash ready to be
made, both dry sift and wet wash.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should be having a good time today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to hit a little rip of the
dry sift that we made yesterday with John
[SPEAKER_06]: B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Haven't seen me do this in a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: I packed my D-nail so we're hitting the
Swiss perk with the B-line.
Anyway,
[SPEAKER_06]: we've got a great trip planned for today
so come join me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go for a ferry ride.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, so about 7 in the morning now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sky is just starting to get a little
bit of color.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to throw the big screens in my
truck here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to catch an 8.30 ferry.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the 4x2 screens here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got some bubble bags, tumble now,
D-nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've basically got everything that
we're going to require to have a great
[SPEAKER_06]: trip over at the great gardeners and yeah,
we'll catch up with you guys on the ferry.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our special guests during our New
Year's Eve run here on Jam On,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the Disco Biscuits.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on a road to come on inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking that ride to nowhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll take that ride.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh really, even with the sled?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just over 20 feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the sled, I'm about 20.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 22, I'm being honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 20.8, otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: 81.30.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, see what you get for being honest
in this world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's 85.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so just down lane number 6,
any gas or propane?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you later.
It's fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: cold as fuck up here at the front of the
ferry, but I think I'm going to head to
[SPEAKER_07]: the back and have a trippy stick and then
go in and grab some food.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk to you soon, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so on the ferry heading over to
the island.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cold, but what a beautiful,
sunny, clear day.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the back of the ferry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a dark ferry where generally you get
the last wind and if you're from British
[SPEAKER_06]: Columbia or if you've gone to the Sunshine
Coast or any of the Gulf Islands,
[SPEAKER_06]: Vancouver Island included, you know that
the back of the ferry is where everyone
[SPEAKER_06]: goes to puff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you bring your joint, you bring your
trippy stick, you bring your pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's generally no troubles to be had
puffing at the back of the ferry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, beautiful day to be heading over
to see the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really excited to see what those guys are
going to pull off today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear they have a beautiful seed crop,
so that should be exciting to work with.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make a little bit of hash and we'll
just take you guys for a little trip
[SPEAKER_06]: through BC.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of the bonuses of living here
for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go grab a snack.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that for a Pelican Case collection?
[SPEAKER_06]: These are my Marcel's that I'm bringing
with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple of my pipes, you know.
A little
[SPEAKER_06]: island for sale if anyone's interested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time is going up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Suck my dick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're at the right place.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, Matt?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Setting up the microscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Setting up a little microscope,
little camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: House of the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So stoked to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bubble drying here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble drying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some bags hanging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we got going here?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big test room, mostly high CBD
phenotypes of a lot of the favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: strains from the Kibasha Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got high CBD Warlock, high CBD
Afghani, high CBD Digweed, high CBD Renne,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a little bit of Afghani on the far
side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these were all crossed with?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all canatonic crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Canatonic crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started off with 50 seeds of each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Narrowed it down to 20, put it into
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then up to 20, five, roughly about
five carried the phenotype that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for, say Warlock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five of them had Warlock
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of those five, then we CBD tested
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roughly about two of them came out high
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're, so right here I got the
Afghani Canatonic 8 and then back there is
[SPEAKER_01]: the Afghani Canatonic 6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're trying to just figure out which
one's best.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, we're going to put it to the
members of the club and we'll let them
[SPEAKER_01]: decide which one they like better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioassay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll have a new CBD line.
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you want to give just the people
who are watching, I know a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: are hearing a lot of things about
different cannabinoids and CBD in
[SPEAKER_06]: particular.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are so many people looking for CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, CBD carries a lot of the medicinal
healing effects without the THC high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people are coming to medical
cannabis, not from the recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, and they want more healing
properties and not necessarily getting
[SPEAKER_01]: really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people like to, you know,
they want to go to work and they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to eat a lozenge or eat something
that's not going to get them high and make
[SPEAKER_01]: their job difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the high CBD strains,
they can have it and they can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pain goes away, inflammation
goes away, headaches go away, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't necessarily get high from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, because they deal with a lot
of clubs, the high CBD is sought after.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Canatonic that we have, everybody
wants it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the popular choice I'm noticing as
well for kids with Dravet syndrome and
[SPEAKER_06]: other forms of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the high CBD is virtually no
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't got our we haven't found one
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a few out there,
but we're still we're still looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: that elusive high CBD low THC phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just going to take a little quick walk
through the aisles here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have done a great job building
some nice rooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's comfortable in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The airflow is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got your ballast tie, which is key.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all your Rezzes are outside in the
hallway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all the Rezzes are outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the ability to hand water and drip
feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially right now when they're small
and sometimes hand watering is best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to drown them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You foliar spray as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of bug be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preventative bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: Preventative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always good to be preventative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only spray during veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never never spray during flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got bugs heading into flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out the Barbara.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Screens are out.
[SPEAKER_06]: More importantly, let's start it with the
house of the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nicely.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the high CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drying racks down at the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll walk through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll kind of see what temperature and
humidities are you looking for in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's open on either end,
it's tough to control.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't feel muggy in here at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more concerned with the air blowing
down and just keeping a constant airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still takes seven to 10 days for them to
dry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll go into bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, we'll treat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flip them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from them, de-stock them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then back into bins.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good process.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the shake is put on screens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's what I'm talking about right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I want people to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how you do it, people.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to go and buy expensive
racks from restaurants.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can build your own.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got them dated and named.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really nice to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just so much resin lost when not
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been sitting on here since
December 13.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ready to be used.
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you have catch trays on the bottoms
or on the very bottom?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have little trays that clip onto here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it clips onto here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you pull it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you flip it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you move it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you pull the next one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only ever it gets flipped once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then from there, it's scooped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either put through the tumblers,
through the tumblers, and then to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ash, then to the bakers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tumblers, bags, and bakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it still has.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it's sort of dry to the touch.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you squeeze it in the middle,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it still has a couple more days to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Barbara Budd seed room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how frosty that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these have been.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fan leaves removed, but a lot of the fan
leaves were crystalline.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's a cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is why you do this over screens,
because he just literally knocked off
[SPEAKER_06]: 853,000 land heads when he did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and we're catching them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're catching them all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they wouldn't be caught without those
screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see, if I just bang these a
little bit, you can see the seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a seed separator that you guys
use, or just do it all over?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple, sort of, again, homemade
machines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just run them through holes?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not even.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use more sort of gravity and airflow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've seen those laser perforated hole
sheets, though?
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are pretty good, with a little
vibrator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the one with the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blows the air up and blows the shaft up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And through the tube or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are pretty impressive, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ingenuity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing beats these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love eating them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, the work here is to deseed
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I destock them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's seed, you don't really
have to do this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the fact that we want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Capture the trichomes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You always want to keep the surface in
front of you clean, because when you cut
[SPEAKER_01]: it off, it hits the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousands of trichomes have just fallen
off that bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you sit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's dry when I could sit here
and use my fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't even need the fiskars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need these scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can operate this whole thing with just
using my scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this bud itself is still, if you
squeezed it, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll sit here and.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do a little de-budding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a little de-budding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a few macro shots of
that resin to show people the quality that
[SPEAKER_06]: you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you have a little pile in
front of you, just slightly push it
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always want to make sure that the bud
falls directly on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that one was definitely well worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice pile of sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get some here for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So will you keep these four separate or
just mix them all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost have to put my shades on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't you glad you did that work on
screens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw it in your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Squeeze it for a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And aromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a word?
[SPEAKER_06]: Close.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aromatic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aromatic?
[SPEAKER_06]: Aromic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
Quick!
Quick!
[SPEAKER_01]: Aromic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you cleaning your sifter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your tumbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tumbler.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it all clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside and out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was showing just the other day we were
using forced air to clean just the
[SPEAKER_06]: screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used forced air a couple of times,
but I'd like to get a more powerful one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We weren't working with enough power.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like even put it in a small box.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see sort of the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do the inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess we're getting ready to do a
little dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're upstairs deseeding that Barbara
bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Matt here is cleaning out the large
pollinator insert tumbler.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got my tumble now as well and
some big screens.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got some big screens, so we're going
to play around and make some dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have long arms though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you need some help?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I say anything, the last run that
went through this was, we called it the 48
[SPEAKER_01]: hour to 72 hour run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already done a 30 second run,
like a minute run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go to an hour run and then we
do a 24 hour run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go from 24 to 48 hour run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we could do the 48 hour to 72
hour run.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the, it's been a run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the 48 hour to 72 hour run.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're cleaning it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to vacuum it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So time to make some dry sift or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we... Oh, that shishkeberry smell
is unreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stopped it, deflected the keith that
fell off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, those are nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice knock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now because it's a seed crop,
why don't you fold it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't dump it too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't dump it all, I'll just fold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll throw the whole batch in the
tumbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to do it for 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll do a one hour run.
[SPEAKER_01]: At which point we'll take it and then go
get the seed out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after we got the seed out of it,
we'll bring it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll bring it back for a 24 hour run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll put it in for a 24 to 48
hour run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put it in for like two days.
48 to 72 hours of run.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Making sure you get it all right.
So
[SPEAKER_06]: what did we just dump in there?
[SPEAKER_06]: 15 pounds of herb?
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 pounds of herb?
[SPEAKER_06]: 5 pounds of herb?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be 10.
[SPEAKER_06]: 5?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, probably 5.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fluffy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well within my storage limits of my MMAR
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, mine too.
So we'll put it in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a stopwatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have a stopwatch?
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 seconds?
[SPEAKER_01]: One minute?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do one minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just leave the lid off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get a scraper.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's nice to be standing next to a nice
large unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tumble now doesn't come in this size,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to run day off of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this particular is a pollinator unit,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: With a little bit of the great gardeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: All in baskets.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you change the screen on it though,
you put your own screen on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the 10 minute run.
[SPEAKER_06]: And oh my god, the smell is like
shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's always that corner in the
initial sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get that on the screens as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the difference in the colors
on the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an almost greenish tinge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you flip the resin over,
you can see a much golder resin
[SPEAKER_06]: underneath.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll get to that later, separating
those two grades.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll show them our plate,
the green and the gold, when we separate
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice pile there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably an ounce, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just mean the pile right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't even gathered up this whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to buy it for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you run this more and more and
more, it will become harder and harder and
[SPEAKER_06]: harder to clean out the gland heads from
the Capcate's dog system of hairs and
[SPEAKER_06]: plant matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grab a piece of cardboard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pick it all up.
Is
[SPEAKER_06]: it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heavy sift is a good sign.
[SPEAKER_06]: Better than light sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tends to be more contaminant, rather.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sift covered everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need big scoops, like painter's tools
or drywaller's tools.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cards are not cutting it for the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're too small.
[SPEAKER_06]: Way too small.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get it out of the microscope and
check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Full melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone?
Anyone?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do the one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hour round.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time is in.
[SPEAKER_06]: 419.
[SPEAKER_01]: 419.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we head on over to the dab
station?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put this in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hour round.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dab time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not bad for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
Well,
[SPEAKER_06]: we gummed right up real fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Warm dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do a little tumble now run
afterwards, too, after we've run this for
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 minutes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a nice smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much on the outside, but after the
24 hour run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you saw that when it was bud,
when we put it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have broken it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does a lot of work for you,
especially with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Kirk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good time to take a look at these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pile got so deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the screen was hitting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks like some hundreds of grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might want to get some type of tub in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to want to get some sort of
tub in there to get all that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good amount of weight right there,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks denser than you think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it is denser than you think.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's denser than it looks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good color.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've gotten to the point where
Barbara's been well sifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sifted it for an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those big, fluffy buds we had are now
just sort of like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got to get the seed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is put it onto this screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the seed and everything that will
already fall through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this one's small, grinding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breaks up all the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, it gets out all the
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do this with gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that loose stuff, all the seed that's
already harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the loose stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it fall through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after
[SPEAKER_01]: you do it all, you end up sort of with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the seed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You separate those further using the
screen separator?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or pull them out by hand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a couple other wind machines that
will blow the chaff away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one more after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more system after that that uses the
angles and lets the seeds roll down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put a fan on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blows off the chaff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a good amount of sift came off of that
Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the one hour run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then after we get the seed out,
we'll actually put this back in the sifter
[SPEAKER_01]: and do a 24 hour run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a 24 hour to 48 hour run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that stuff will go to edibles,
tinctures, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's chores.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking down a little can of tonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: ICVD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been hanging for just about a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're going to put it in the bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'll probably leave the lid
off of the bins overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll sort of, then we'll flip
them a couple days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably three or four days, five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll de-stock it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes back into the bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just a process of every day
you go in, slide your hand to the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it feels a little moister at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you sort of flip it up until you can
show up and reach your hand to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it feels the same as the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can sort of put the lid on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At which point, you can cure it for
however you want or you can smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like curing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And is this a seeded crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is just regular crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little medicine crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a medicine crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
It's ready to go.
Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
