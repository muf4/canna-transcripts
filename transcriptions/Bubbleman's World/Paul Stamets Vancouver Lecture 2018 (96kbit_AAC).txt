[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for coming out.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Matt Breach.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the CEO of Paul Grass.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a company that's partnered with Paul
Stamets' company to bring this wonderful
[SPEAKER_06]: medicinal mushrooms to Canadians.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're also bringing Paul Stamets to
Canadians this evening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for joining us for his talk on
the subject of mushrooms mycelium and the
[SPEAKER_06]: mycology of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul Stamets has published six books.
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the topic of mushrooms and has
discovered numerous new unique mushroom
[SPEAKER_06]: species.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is the owner of Fungi Perfecta,
a maker of host defense mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he has won a number of awards,
including the Gordon and Tina Watson
[SPEAKER_06]: Mycology Award from the American Mycology
Society, as well as the Mycologist of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Year Award from the North American
Mycology Association, and the invention of
[SPEAKER_06]: the Astor Award for the American
Association for the Advancement of
[SPEAKER_06]: Science.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that year that he won that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was him and the inventor of the digital
camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a good company for that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those of you who follow these
things, he's also now been immortalized in
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek discovery.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, as none other than
Lieutenant Paul Stamets, astro-mycologist.
[SPEAKER_06]: So without further ado, please give Paul
Stamets a warm welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent a lot of time in Canada in the
past few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to first give a shout out in
acknowledgement and dedicate my talk to
[SPEAKER_03]: the First Nations.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been so gracious in allowing us to
cohabit this land.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of my talk centers on ancestral
knowledge that is now being verified by
[SPEAKER_03]: current scientific methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have entered into 6X, the sixth
greatest extinction event known in the
[SPEAKER_03]: history of life on this planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this extinction event is not caused by
the asteroid impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's caused by an organism, by us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only are we the cause of this
extinction event, but we're likely to be
[SPEAKER_03]: its victim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Though as severe as that sounds,
and the numbers are quite disturbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are about 10 million species on this
planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're losing more than 30,000 species per
year in the map.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 100 plus years, we'll lose more than a
third of the biodiversity that has gotten
[SPEAKER_03]: us here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're at a time critical in the
evolution of life on this planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: As severe as those numbers are,
I want you to understand that if I have
[SPEAKER_03]: great hope, nature awakens with all sorts
of possibilities and solutions that are
[SPEAKER_03]: literally underfoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that I want you to
sort of clear your minds, clear your
[SPEAKER_03]: receptor sites, open up your hearts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm going to take you on a magical
mushroom mystery tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a very unusual path towards the
invention of something that is paradigm
[SPEAKER_03]: shifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will literally affect everyone in
this room at the very end of my talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before I jump into this magical
mushroom mystery tour, I'd like to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about my hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: My hat, I think, makes me look very
handsome.
[SPEAKER_03]: The back of these hats make anyone look
very handsome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this hat was made from an amadou
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: An amadou mushroom is a birch polypore
called Fomis fomentarius, the Latin
[SPEAKER_03]: binomial.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows on birch and beech trees
primarily through the temporal regions of
[SPEAKER_03]: the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, amadou is a unique mushroom,
and that is a fire starter mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can drill this hollow of this mushroom
out, put numbers of fire inside,
[SPEAKER_03]: and literally carry your fire for days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was absolutely critical for our
ancestors' survival.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no doubt that we're all from
Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: We migrated north into Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We discovered something new called winter
moose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your plant cannot keep fire alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, in the wintertime, you can
perish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is about the portability of fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our ancestors also found that
when you boil this mushroom or soak it in
[SPEAKER_03]: lye water, it would de-laminate into my
saline.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this hat was actually made by some
ladies in Transylvania.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only about five families that are
currently making them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was about 30 or 40 families just 10
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because of the restriction of
habitats, these mushrooms are becoming
[SPEAKER_03]: harder to find, the large ones can make
one hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have smaller ones, they're harder
to piece together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this mushroom has other unique
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it is so flammable, my hat is so
flammable.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why if someone's smoking a
cigarette or a joint or on a fire,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually had a hat catch on fire and
simmered for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it burst into flames.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this fire starter mushroom also
helped revolutionize warfare and allowed
[SPEAKER_03]: flint spark guns to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chinese invented gun power,
but the Europeans invented the flint spark
[SPEAKER_03]: rifle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, in the Roman times,
that's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a massive trade of Mamadou
mushrooms in support of Napoleon's parmix,
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this mushroom also has other
characteristics that are very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the first mushroom that I know of in
scientific literature identified to have
[SPEAKER_03]: antiviral properties against the tobacco
mosaic virus that causes a curly roll in
[SPEAKER_03]: all sorts of planets.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very economically devastating
to agriculture in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: But moreover, this also was used by flying
fishermen to dry out flies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when they would be fly fishing,
as you fly fishers know, you have to bow
[SPEAKER_03]: down your fly so you could tap your fly
and dry it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this mushroom also has other very,
very unique properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the biodiversity, the
microdiversity of fungi in our ecosystem
[SPEAKER_03]: has played a pivotal role in the evolution
and survival of our species.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's several of these species that I've
been talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about Chaga,
which also lives on birch and bee's trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be talking about the red-belted
polypore that is one of the most common
[SPEAKER_03]: polypores in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's virtually the most small forest
throughout the entire world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have another friend I brought
with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one is a special favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a gherkin, the longest-living
mushroom in the world, exclusively growing
[SPEAKER_03]: in the old growth forests of Northern
California, Oregon, Washington,
[SPEAKER_03]: and British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now exists only a few sky-opinions in
Europe and Austria and Slovenia at the
[SPEAKER_03]: border.
[SPEAKER_03]: This mushroom is exclusively growing in
old growth forests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we lose the forest, and we lose the
endemic populations of the species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to present to you that this
mushroom will have as much of an
[SPEAKER_03]: importance as all of you did in helping
you survive, and our ancestors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this mushroom and these other ones
that I mentioned are absolutely critical
[SPEAKER_03]: for human survival as we march forward
into the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put in the lights a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we have one here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do it with my hand here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the clicker's not working, so I'm going
to use this with the AD people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to march through my computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a simplified view of the
mushroom life cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, two spores have to come
together and mate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They mate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They fuse together.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have mycelium.
[SPEAKER_03]: One spore is mononucleotide.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one nucleus per cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they join together,
they have two nuclei per cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called dicarionic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after they've mated, they're
fully capable of producing a mushroom,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a burrow hot spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mushrooms are called fruit bodies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come to the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mushrooms can develop very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, not so much for the polyphore
mushroom and the vast majority of fleshy
[SPEAKER_03]: mushroom that you're familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow up, and they form, and they
expand, and they mature in only a few
[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the navigation of the mycelium through
a hostile microbial environment takes
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks, months, sometimes years,
which is a fleshy fruit body that quickly
[SPEAKER_03]: rots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's an example of how quickly the
mycelium grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over a few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mycelium that never matures forms
these mycelial mats.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are some of the mycelium-electron
micrographs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the arrows point to hypoagrigous,
the very beginning of mushroom formation.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are called primordial.
[SPEAKER_03]: The primordia then form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And typically, primordia form in response
to poor environmental stimuli.
[SPEAKER_03]: The introduction of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have water and rain, you have
evaporations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have evaporative pooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a drop in temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then dropping in temperature is number
two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, the mycelium comes to the
surface where it rains, exhales carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: dioxide, inhales oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the third one, is the
availability of oxygen and being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: exhale carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fourth one is quite surprising.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be talking about this as light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most mushrooms require light.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the mushrooms you see in the store,
they're growing in the dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the vast majority of mushrooms are
photosensitive and phototrophic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the band that supplies that light is
absolutely critical for their maturation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very quickly, a primordium form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it bursts out the other mycelium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fully matures, releases spores.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can go from this stage to this
stage to then a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is an over-mature mushroom,
the genus rushula.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it is past its prime.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mushrooms give themselves up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The central key concept here is that
mushrooms don't have a good immune system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the mycelium does.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mycelium is surrounded by hostiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to work with them since only one
cell will fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mushrooms are hundreds and thousands of
cell walls there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it matures.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ripens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called a fruit body.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a peach.
[SPEAKER_03]: It attracts herbivores, people,
animals, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ripens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's nutritious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then by eating the peach, the peach
pit is spread.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the peach pit can germinate with
a nutritional form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fruit bodies typically, both plants and
animals, beckon and attract animals in
[SPEAKER_03]: order to spread them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tend to be highly perishable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the mycelium then, as the mushroom
begins to rot, spores germinate from the
[SPEAKER_03]: gills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of other organisms co-occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mycelium then goes to the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: In one cubic inch of soil that's fully
mycelium, it can be between one and eight
[SPEAKER_03]: miles of mycelium.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually stretch those mycelium end upon
end.
[SPEAKER_03]: My foot is covering approximately 300
miles of mycelium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the mycelium is not only like an
externalized lung, it's actually carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: monoxide and helium and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're an externalized digestive
membrane.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no site-specific place or stomach
in a mushroom mycelium.
[SPEAKER_03]: The entire membrane is releasing enzymes,
acids, all sorts of other chemicals,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then breaking down the nutrients to
form the mycelium and absorb those
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients of these directly through its
cell walls.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are externalized lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're externalized stomachs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mycelium is wonderfully
articulated to withstand catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is an impact of disturbing the
mycelium from whatever type of
[SPEAKER_03]: disturbance, the mycelium oftentimes works
in response.
[SPEAKER_03]: It regrows and replenishes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's always alternative pathways
before channeling nuclei and nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: should any strand of the mycelial mat be
interrupted or broken.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good friend of mine, Patrick Hickey,
I came up with this little movie here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He calls these common nuclei.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is over about three or four hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are hundreds of nuclei streaming
through the mycelial network.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now when we had still photography looking
at the microscope, we couldn't see this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's amazing is that the mycelium
channels these nuclei.
[SPEAKER_03]: They become polynucleate at the tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned before, there's two nuclei per
cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the tips, they become polynucleate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in the breadth of my hands,
about a meter to two meters across,
[SPEAKER_03]: there can literally be trillions,
literally trillions of end branches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the tips of polynucleate,
there's multiple nuclei.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these nuclei, if they re-assort,
[SPEAKER_03]: if they re-arrange and express the
epigenesis, a new enzyme, an acid that can
[SPEAKER_03]: capture and break down that potential food
source and absorb it, what happens?
[SPEAKER_03]: The mycelium surges.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has now been coded for a new digestive
system for being able to capture that
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to wax quote it, but I firmly
believe this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mycelium conforms to an archetype,
an archetype that I believe, in the course
[SPEAKER_03]: of evolution, nature builds upon the
previous evolutionary successes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mycelium forms networks not dissimilar
to that of neurons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the computer internet,
one of the reasons why it's so resilient
[SPEAKER_03]: is there's so many nodes and crossings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also conforms to the same archetype.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I present to you that directly after
the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: the organization then of matter also
conforms to string theory and develops
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these same networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one parsec, about two,
three, four, two, six light years in
[SPEAKER_03]: diameter at the highest magnification.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're pulling back now and begin to
see the same archetype shared by mycelium.
[SPEAKER_03]: By neurons, by the computer internet,
and the vastness of the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then looking at the organization of
dark matter, these are the ellipses,
[SPEAKER_03]: or galaxies, of the Hubble telescope.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you will view, there's over 100,000
galaxies depicted in this one view.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the organization of dark matter also
conforms to that of the same archetype
[SPEAKER_03]: shared by mycelium.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the computer internet, by our neurons,
and the organization of matter in the
[SPEAKER_03]: universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the universe formed about 14
billion years ago, then back in Stardust,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, would have called us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Earth formed about 4.5
billion years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when the Earth formed, only 20 to 40
million years, would have formed 4.5
[SPEAKER_03]: billion years ago, then amazing celestial
events occurred.
[SPEAKER_03]: The planet, Theia, came crashing into the
Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was smaller than Mars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It jettisoned enormous amounts of debris
in the gravitational field of the Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the moon then coalesced from that
impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why, when the lunar astronauts
went to the moon and came back,
[SPEAKER_03]: the radioisotopes were delicate to that of
the Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then looking at the fossil record,
2.4 billion years ago, in South Africa,
[SPEAKER_03]: the first evidence of a multicellular
organism was discovered this past year.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2.4 billion years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we split from the fungi 600 million
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a new super-kingdom called
Opaistoconta.
[SPEAKER_03]: Opaistoconta joins Anemalia and fungi
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: 600 million years ago, we split from the
fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, and the fungi, went to choose this
filamentous route of the web of mycelium.
[SPEAKER_03]: We chose to encapsulate in our nutrients a
cellular cell, basically a stomach,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then produce gastric juices in order
to break down that fluid in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: absorb it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But think of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: 600 billion years ago, we split from
fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: But 1.8 billion years later, animals begin
to emerge.
[SPEAKER_03]: This means that we are descended from
fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our filamentous ancestors were fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the children of fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we move forward into the 420 to 360
billion years ago, a giant organism
[SPEAKER_03]: thought of the landscapes of Earth at the
time that vascular plants and trees and
[SPEAKER_03]: woody shrubs had not yet evolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ferns existed, but the tallest plants on
Earth were less than three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: This fossil was discovered.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over 10 meters in length.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is called the prototaxidase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, prototaxidase is 10 meters in length
with a enormous fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Kevin Boyce and Francis Hoover
were able to determine that prototaxidase
[SPEAKER_03]: was first discovered in 1859.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fossils are present in Quebec and
elsewhere in Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're dotting across the face of the
Earth with this giant fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're 10 meters, 35 feet, 40 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tallest organisms on Earth at the
time, when the electromagnetic fields were
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely active, lots of lightning
strikes, so they'd attract lightning and
[SPEAKER_03]: zap these prototaxidases.
[SPEAKER_03]: A perfect environment for epigenesis,
a stimulation of evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we advanced from 420 billion years ago,
and they have a giant prototaxidase.
[SPEAKER_03]: 250 million years ago, we had an asteroid
impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of the celestial heavens hurled this
asteroid that zoomed down into the Earth
[SPEAKER_03]: and had an impact, causing great
extinction at the Permian Triassic
[SPEAKER_03]: Boundary, resulting in more than 90% of
the organisms, or plants and animals,
[SPEAKER_03]: to become extinct.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Earth became shrouded in dust,
sunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited
[SPEAKER_03]: the Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, in the most Permian Triassic
extinction event, the Bt Boundary,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have a very good evidence of a fossil
record of exactly this extinction event.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we also, the fossil record,
will be able to find fossils of a fungus
[SPEAKER_03]: called Redudios sporaeides.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dominates the fossil record as the
fungus group that gobbled up the wind
[SPEAKER_03]: debris of the forest being destroyed and
we advanced forward to the time of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Guangdong Plan, the continental drift
begins, the formation of the continents as
[SPEAKER_03]: we know today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through the continental drift,
then we had species proliferating,
[SPEAKER_03]: because when you have isolation of land
passes, then you have differentiation in
[SPEAKER_03]: the species biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We then go forward to 110 million years
ago, and this was also discovered this
[SPEAKER_03]: past year, in Brazil, 110 million years
ago, we had found a fossil, the scientists
[SPEAKER_03]: found a fossilized mushroom, complete with
its stems and gills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now think about it, 110 million years ago,
the dinosaurs became extinct 65 million
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago, these are ancient, ancient
organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mushrooms had their form long before we
had ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it, the implications.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we go forward again, and we have
another celestial visitor 65 million years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another asteroid impact comes out of the
heavens, impacts the earth, and massive
[SPEAKER_03]: catastrophe, enormous amounts of debris,
again, jettisoned into the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_03]: the earth is shrouded by dust,
sunlight is cut off, plant samples die,
[SPEAKER_03]: and fungi re-incurve the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: The implications here, I think,
are profound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those organisms that paired with fungi
tend to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are now facing six attacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is time for us to learn the lessons of
evolution, and realize for us to survive
[SPEAKER_03]: extinction events, pairing and partnering
with fungi is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, our current ecosystem looks today,
the current continents, and so,
[SPEAKER_03]: then animals, then flourish, and then,
our primates begin to evolve, and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: really fascinated in looking at how many
primates consume mushrooms, and so,
[SPEAKER_03]: this Australian research group published
this paper, of a golden monkey from
[SPEAKER_03]: Brazil, consumes more than 12 times its
body weight per year in fungi and
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Americans consume about two kilograms per
year, less than 3% of our body weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, primates, and in particular,
22 primates are known to identify and
[SPEAKER_03]: consume mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowing the difference between edible and
poisonous ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, 23, if you add humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this speaks to a very deep ancestry of
the knowledge and the wisdom of knowing
[SPEAKER_03]: which mushrooms are good, safe to consume.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there's a term called mycophobia,
the irrational, irrational here in fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, think of it, in your visual
landscape, you're using plants as animals
[SPEAKER_03]: for months, years, you have a familiarity
factor, because you have constant contact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, mushrooms pop up and disappear in a
few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some mushrooms can feed you, some can heal
you, some can kill you, some can send you
[SPEAKER_03]: on spiritual journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: For something so powerful, and yet so
incredible, it is natural for humans to
[SPEAKER_03]: avoid that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the cognizantity of indigenous peoples
held this sacred knowledge, and was able
[SPEAKER_03]: to pass it down to the generations until
we know which mushrooms are edible or
[SPEAKER_03]: poisonous today.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we know which ones are edible or
poisonous?
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that prior experience of the
people who eat them was worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, this is the body and the life that
our ancestors have had to pass on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But something phenomenal happened in the
primate evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: About two million years ago, our
ancestors' brain suddenly emerged by more
[SPEAKER_03]: than a factor of two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Homeless aliens incurred about $200,000
years ago, and what caused the sudden
[SPEAKER_03]: doubling of the primate brain,
especially the prefrontal cortex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there was also coincident and massive
amount of climate change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Homo erectus became extinct about 75,000
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Homo sapiens, in parts of Europe,
Homo erectus was there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The animals became extinct within 4,000
years of contact in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all of us have Neanderthal genes in
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a 23 read-up, 2.9% Neanderthal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of went that way, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this sudden advantage that homo
sapiens have for Homo erectus and
[SPEAKER_03]: Neanderthals is a mystery that cannot be
fully explained.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a theory, it's a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what I'm going to present to you is
an unprovable hypothesis, but I want for
[SPEAKER_03]: you just to ask yourself to suspend your
disbelief on what I'm going to present,
[SPEAKER_03]: and look at it from a circumstantial point
of view and the evidence that we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this speaks to the Stone Age Theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it's actually a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our primate ancestors, as it was
postulated by Jerry and St. Dennis
[SPEAKER_03]: McKenna, came out of the Samanians to talk
to us about what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were talking about what they were
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: New synopsis, new neurons, new
connections, the ability to conceive,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to invent new weapons,
to be able to strategize.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what Terence McKenna described as
his own.
[SPEAKER_03]: A theory that I propose to you is not a
theory, it's a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why I just found a theory is a
hypothesis of an educated guess to explain
[SPEAKER_03]: it on turbo look mom on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The theory is a hypothesis that can be
tested by science and factual support.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have enough time to go over
hundreds of thousands of years to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to see if this is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But interestingly, there is increased
evidence that speaks to neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Sicilian rock art of northern
Algeria, the first image I'll show you is
[SPEAKER_03]: the actual pictograph, 7,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been recolorized by a friend of mine,
Jonathan Beter, so you can see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the B man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's known well in Mesoamerica,
and so to this day, it doesn't deserve
[SPEAKER_03]: magic mushrooms, you can put them in
honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I suggest that this has led to the
formation of more psychoactive means,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there was the Bavarian Beer Purity Act
of 1516 that made out specifically
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms by name, from being put into
beer, as well as the end date of a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of other plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a struggle between
monotheism and polytheism, between
[SPEAKER_03]: Christianity and pagan people celebrating
nature and life in the forest,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the Catholic Church and the
institutions wanted to institutionalize
[SPEAKER_03]: and tax the ability of citizens to alter
their consciousness.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is very probable that the
psychoactive means of Europe were
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically immune to these magic
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that knowledge is not only European,
but also in the Mesoamericans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Slotsky's Slotsieta is a very common
mushroom here in Vermont, Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Art Gordon, Boston, and Maria Sabina,
1955, and J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beter is giving Persephone a mushroom,
and Papan consuming the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Greek culture, Persephone, that goes
into deep sleep, she goes into the
[SPEAKER_03]: underworld, and Greek mythology has the
advent of winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, life magazine distributed millions
of these magazines in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold War, obviously in 1957, to the
doorsteps of Americans, and reporting on
[SPEAKER_03]: Art Gordon, Boston, and Valentina's
experience in seeking the magic mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was an actually a good fluidite
that had shown that it would take the
[SPEAKER_03]: right specimens.
[SPEAKER_03]: This caused an enormous amount of
Americans and Indians and Europeans to go
[SPEAKER_03]: to Mexico to look for the quote unquote
magic mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the use of mushrooms in Mesoamerica,
it goes back a thousand times.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are mushroom stones.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are specifically identified as
symbols of adultery by the Catholic
[SPEAKER_03]: Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when the Spanish conquistadors came
over, in order to suppress native
[SPEAKER_03]: indigenous religions, they would smash
these by the thousands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the Europeans came with their
great ships, they brought also disease,
[SPEAKER_03]: they had iron, they had metal weapons,
they had superior warfare technology,
[SPEAKER_03]: because the Romans of that time had no
experience with smallpox, but tuberculosis
[SPEAKER_03]: is debatable, it could have been there
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: But many of the diseases the Europeans
came on, the native people did not have
[SPEAKER_03]: time to adapt, to look for native
remedies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Masses die off by millions and millions of
Mesoamericans due to European diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a temporary, my wife and I are the
temporary custodians of 17 of these
[SPEAKER_03]: mushroom stones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've collected them over the course of all
the years of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to pass them back to the indigenous
peoples at the right time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But several indigenous peoples from
Guatemala and other people associated with
[SPEAKER_03]: the Guatemalan government have told me,
don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't return them to the Guatemalan
government.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be sold off on the black market.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no institutions down there that
can hold these about mushroom stones in
[SPEAKER_03]: their proper regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And two sons have told me, Paul,
they're safer than you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hold onto them until the time is
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these are extraordinarily
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much of my work was sponsored by these
four individuals who were actually
[SPEAKER_03]: critical in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Michael Mews, holding the two baskets
there, he's a professor at the University
[SPEAKER_03]: of California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Alexander Smith to the right is from
the University of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Daniel Stuntz to the lower left from
the University of Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Kit Skates from the Coastal Walls of
Idaho.
[SPEAKER_03]: These people are extraordinarily
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the 1970s, I had been self-taught
mushroom identification.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm living up in the cascades of the
water, living in the woods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm living by myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was coming down to the University of
Washington Library, living up literature
[SPEAKER_03]: on soul-sucking mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I met these giants in the field of
micrology.
[SPEAKER_03]: These people were concerned politically,
so it was really nice and generous of them
[SPEAKER_03]: to take me under their wing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I was 19 years old,
this is what I looked like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your suspicions are now confirmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had a passionate interest in
technology and mushroom identification.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of my skill sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my brother John went to Yale.
[SPEAKER_03]: John went to the University of Washington
and had a full scholarship in
[SPEAKER_03]: neurophysiology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm the youngest one in my family.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother John was five, six years older
than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was always trying to address my
brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother John went to Mexico and
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came back home and gave me crazy local
stories about tripping on magic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was super deeply pure about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was always trying to impress my
brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I received the AAAS Award for the
most prestigious scientific organization
[SPEAKER_03]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I received the award, and I got really
excited because I was trying to impress my
[SPEAKER_03]: brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: My research is legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: John really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: My younger brother's doing some real good
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my older brother, younger brother,
dynamics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I called my brother up, and I got the
award on a Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't answer his phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was so excited to tell my brother
that the most prestigious scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: organization in the world authenticated my
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he didn't answer the phone because he
had died that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So John never got the message.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if I met John, I had the dear love
for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because John first got me excited about
mushroom identification.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, John got me excited about mushrooms,
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he came back from Yale University with
this book called Altered Space and
[SPEAKER_03]: Consciousness by Charles Turner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we grew up in a small town called
Columbia in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had a very large house,
but we had a fully equipped laboratory in
[SPEAKER_03]: the basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought all houses had laboratories in
the basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go to my friend's house and go,
where's your laboratory?
[SPEAKER_03]: But they had a fully equipped laboratory,
three rows of shelves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had the radio.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called the aircraft carrier,
the Intrepid.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dad served on it in World War II.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after World War II, he brought the
radio from the aircraft carrier we had in
[SPEAKER_03]: the basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could play in the radio.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my brother John would not let me play
with any chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would blow up things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So John brought back this book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, John, I'm really interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I borrow this book?
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't back away because I'm going
back to Yale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, OK, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I borrowed the book from my friend,
Ryan Snyder, my best friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Ryan saw me real excited about this
book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan said, well, can I borrow your brother
John's book?
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Ryan borrows my book, my brother John's
book.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few days passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few more days passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, Ryan, I need my book back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hurry.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother John needs it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my brother John's passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, where's the book?
[SPEAKER_03]: I need my book back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally,
[SPEAKER_03]: I confronted Ryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really upset.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, Ryan, where is my brother John's
book?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ryan sheepishly looked down and said,
Paul, I can't give it back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my father found it in Burma.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, so today, I have a debt of
gratitude to Ryan Snyder's father because
[SPEAKER_03]: he actually inspired me on my path.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I thought, this book is so
powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they have one in Burma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't this something that I'd definitely
want to get into?
[SPEAKER_03]: So philosophy events has come and have its
other magnetic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes on elephant, dung, hippopotamus,
zebra, horse, buffalo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went on to the Irvington State
College.
[SPEAKER_03]: We received the Golden Course of
Administration License.
[SPEAKER_03]: I published four new semesters of Jewish
philosophy called Silicide and Active.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a huge interest in suicide
mushrooms in the 70s and early 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sort of waned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was massive people collecting
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it sort of faded from popularity
to a large degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was sort of rediscovered by
medical researchers, in particular at
[SPEAKER_03]: Johns Hopkins Medical School and now New
York University UCLA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is about a half dozen now
clinical studies on suicide as a medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: therapeutically, to deal with people at
the end of life experiences who have
[SPEAKER_03]: significantly positive experiences even 14
months later.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's interesting is the majority of
people had positive experiences clinically
[SPEAKER_03]: on the supervision of physicians at Johns
Hopkins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 14 months later, either their friends
or their wives or husbands and their
[SPEAKER_03]: children or other people closely said,
this person has dramatically improved
[SPEAKER_03]: their attitude, their ease of eating along
with, they've had positive effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few people who had negative effects,
the negative effects could not last longer
[SPEAKER_03]: than the experience itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no residual negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Impressions supplement with the fact that
I don't wanna do those again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this study came out this past year.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: 480,000 people surveyed by DSHS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And suicide was used one time in their
life, statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the 27% decreased odds of last year
worsening death.
[SPEAKER_03]: 22% decreased odds of property claim.
[SPEAKER_03]: 18% odds of property claim.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a violent crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not an association, it's not
necessarily a causation, but it can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: This study just came out this past two
months.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an increase related, a nature
related, there's an increased attraction
[SPEAKER_03]: to authoritarian political views after use
of suicide.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can think of one president who really
needs suicide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this is really extraordinary
that these people from the experiences of
[SPEAKER_03]: one time, the suicide would have such a
dramatic impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now we know that suicide would not
have basically hit campus causing
[SPEAKER_03]: neurogenesis, the extinction of the fear
response.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with PTSD, rape victims, people
experiencing trauma, this is something
[SPEAKER_03]: that's gotten its positions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The psychotherapist is very excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: The FDA in the United States is looking at
rescheduling the suicide, rescheduling one
[SPEAKER_03]: drug, which means it has no medical
benefit for use, into a schedule two.
[SPEAKER_03]: 14 FDA officials and scientists met with a
group of other researchers that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: studying psilocybin, and they think
everything's going to be good for PTSD for
[SPEAKER_03]: soldiers coming back from Iraq and
Afghanistan, and the FDA says no.
[SPEAKER_03]: PTSD affects so many people.
[SPEAKER_03]: In car accidents, you know, you have
sexual trauma.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people have PTSD, and they've
never found any thing they said.
[SPEAKER_03]: The FDA has never found or seen anything
that clinically is most significant from
[SPEAKER_03]: one time experience with such a low
toxicity and a long history of proven use
[SPEAKER_03]: of safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that's really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we're going to be seeing a
lot more research on the use of psilocybin
[SPEAKER_03]: as a therapeutic drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, because psilocybin extinguishes a
fewer conditioning response, now think
[SPEAKER_03]: about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our ancestors going through the
wilderness, disasterous events,
[SPEAKER_03]: people are harmed and hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the leader of your grant plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You trip on as much of your way to
overcome your fear response and
[SPEAKER_03]: conditioning, and the next time you
encounter a safer treatment, you can
[SPEAKER_03]: survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this means that psilocybin induces
courage and kindness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing to mean to the one of your
fellow tribespeople, courage to overcome
[SPEAKER_03]: the fear response is being conditioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: One fact, these are leadership skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know from the DSHS study,
you meet with better citizens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's multiple studies at John
Hopkins University.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first study is now, and there's about
a half a dozen other studies now,
[SPEAKER_03]: that show that psilocybin therapy is an
adult treatment for psychiatric disorders
[SPEAKER_03]: that are otherwise not responsive to other
conventional medicines.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a recent therapeutic mechanism
that is now a bit shown that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: change your mind, literally, in one of
these experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: The immediate response to emotional,
but based on psilocybin, you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: different response to facial recognition,
to people who may have harmed you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is an extraordinary slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the left, this is your brain without
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the right, this is your brain with
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which brain do you want?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's now become very popular is
microdosing in Silicon Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And microdosing is basically taking a low,
sub-pressural dose of psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_03]: which would not feel an effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is extremely popular in Silicon
Valley, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: For co-workers, for people writing complex
software.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're using it, and it's very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking to people, very straight people,
will never consider using a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they think about the ability of
creating neurogenesis and greater
[SPEAKER_03]: creativity, greater intellectual acumen,
being able to prevent dementia,
[SPEAKER_03]: the idea of taking a sub-pressural dose,
like a vitamin, to be able to increase
[SPEAKER_03]: their cognitive abilities is extremely
appealing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I call this epigenetic neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this has been written up on Wall
Street Journal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of you know about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many, many people here in this audience
are actually participating in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now, psilocybin mushrooms may be the
first smart mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the lion's mane is also a mushroom of
extraordinarily great interest right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The manatee of lion's mane is obvious that
they're illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're long-use for abuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lion's mane mushrooms contain vulnerable
compounds called arid aces and carcinomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are nerve growth factors that cause
a reminiscence.
[SPEAKER_03]: They show that lion's mane mushrooms
improve significantly the model of
[SPEAKER_03]: cognitive impairment in adult lionine C of
O control studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they show an increased ability to
develop cognition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly, they're using about three
grams of lion's mane per day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But statistically significant,
when they stop using lion's mane in these
[SPEAKER_03]: elderly patients, then the dementia-like
symptoms reach high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lion's mane mushrooms contain these
compounds, but an extraordinary
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting thing to me is when we did
analyses for the arid aces between
[SPEAKER_03]: different species or different strains,
we got very different results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now lion's mane mushrooms have these
compounds called arid aces named after
[SPEAKER_03]: heresium aridaceus.
[SPEAKER_03]: But lion's mane was discovered to have
these neurogenic properties because of a
[SPEAKER_03]: researcher named Kawagishi in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he published a patent in 1994
specifically suggesting that lion's mane
[SPEAKER_03]: could be implemented into Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good for MS victims.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good for many forms of
neuropathies.
[SPEAKER_03]: How he discovered this is extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_03]: He looked at bird's nest fungi,
and he looked for anti-material agents
[SPEAKER_03]: from bird's nest fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: He looked at a couple of fungi with little
flying saucers in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody would know what you see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he found that the resiopane was named
after the genocidus, the bird's nest
[SPEAKER_03]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they did batch fermentation
of the lion's mane mycelium in pure
[SPEAKER_03]: cultures, like they do in Bayhom's
cinnabar products, when they analyzed the
[SPEAKER_03]: mycelium, it had none of these arid aces.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns out that when the fermentation
stopped and the mycelium all belonged
[SPEAKER_03]: together, then the immunity of the
mycelium declined to mature, and then a
[SPEAKER_03]: bacterium would come in that still has
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of the contact with bacteria
in the mycelium, it would have a genesis,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a new response was created,
creating the arid aces.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it meant that pure culture in lion's
mane mushrooms did not have the best way
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow it, having these conventional
bacteria associated with it elicited the
[SPEAKER_03]: arid aces production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Though these mushrooms also, these
compounds are also found in bear's head,
[SPEAKER_03]: resiopane biotis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most of you have seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the safest mushrooms in the
world to identify.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing that looks like it because
it's poisonous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a group of researchers then did some
research with lion's mane mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_03]: with the genus Eurystium, with mice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these studies are particularly
fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had these mice, and they injected
them with a toxic polypeptide that induces
[SPEAKER_03]: all sorts of symptoms, induces an amyloid
blast, causes demyelination.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they put these mice in an arena,
and there was a white test.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go left, you go right, you go left.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mice very, very quickly learned to go
left.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they injected with a cyanotoxic
polypeptide, the mice got confused.
[SPEAKER_03]: They began to randomize.
[SPEAKER_03]: As full-blown dementia and the
neurodegenerational occurred, they then
[SPEAKER_03]: equally went left and right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They forgot which way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they fed those mice fully diseased,
and they sacrificed some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: gazelium, one class forming in the brain,
they fed those mushrooms who were fully
[SPEAKER_03]: diseased lion's mane mushrooms 23 days
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: They significantly improved their ability
to remember which way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another test that would be of course
fascinating, a novelty experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put two objects inside the arena,
a hundred mice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mice very, very quickly explore
those objects, and they go count versus
[SPEAKER_03]: how many points of contact, how many times
the mice came and visited those objects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they injected them with a
polypeptide again, and when they put a new
[SPEAKER_03]: object into the arena, they were
disinterested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Loss of curiosity, novelty, response was
not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, they fed them lion's mane
mushrooms, fully diseased, neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The then mice reeking in their sense of
curiosity and wizziness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sacrificing the mice, they saw a deep
re-mimization in her, and they happily
[SPEAKER_03]: relaxed when they moved.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is phenomenally important.
[SPEAKER_03]: A tragedy of age that is likely to be
acknowledged with many of the elders,
[SPEAKER_03]: but completely acknowledged through their
lifetime experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they then began to lose it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not able to pass it down to future
generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a mushroom I think all of you
should be taking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally take it every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that I think is one of
the most profound examples in the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: kingdom of a medicinal mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is the difference now between a
medicinal food and a drug?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a new category.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at neurogenesis from the soul
assignment, looking at neurogenesis from
[SPEAKER_03]: lion's mane mushrooms, I want to propose
to you a new formula, a new neurotrophic
[SPEAKER_03]: vitamin complex, a stacking formula
combining soul assignment, hereditesis,
[SPEAKER_03]: and vitamin B3.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now why vitamin B3?
Niacin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Niacin, you think niacin, you flush bed,
and the nerves tingle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my concept here, we can use niacin to
drive neurogenesis to the end point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the properties, typically at the
tips of your, at the end of your nerve
[SPEAKER_03]: endings, your toes, your fingers,
you have an ending of the nerves.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea is to excite and then drive the
neurogenic compounds of soul assignment
[SPEAKER_03]: and hereditesis to the nerve endings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what neurogenesis can occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is extraordinarily interesting to
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this idea of stacking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping here in Canada we can design a
clinical study to test this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is that sub-threshold doses.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no change in consciousness at
these levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: At higher levels, it could be a little bit
change in consciousness, but you quickly
[SPEAKER_03]: acclimate.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the lower levels, there's none at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So also, it was discovered that with soul
assignment in contact, that there is a
[SPEAKER_03]: pro-environmental change of behavior.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this speaks to me very deeply and very
personally, because of my experiences on
[SPEAKER_03]: soul assignment.
[SPEAKER_03]: My heart opens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel expansive in the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trees are access wounding, taking me into
the depths of the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel one with nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocks are alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavens are my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a sense of empathy, one with
nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is informative in my experiences that
I've led to discoveries that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The largest organism in the world,
the mycelial map of Eastern Oregon,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2200 acres in size, is a honey mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only one cell wall thick.
[SPEAKER_03]: How is it possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: The largest organism in the world is one
cell wall thick.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 5 or 6 skin layers that protect us
from the effects of mycelium, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: One surround 100 million of microbes per
gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those biologists here know this well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take a scoop of gram of soil,
you measure how many polypore units there
[SPEAKER_03]: are, how many organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 million is very common.
[SPEAKER_03]: For all these microbes being surrounded by
mycelium, one cell wall thick,
[SPEAKER_03]: how is it possible to achieve the largest
size of an airport?
[SPEAKER_03]: It does so because of the host defense of
immunity that through epigenesis is able
[SPEAKER_03]: to code for resistance to productive
antibiotics to stay off those predators.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we are dependent upon these mycelial
networks of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, because of repetitive
devastation and lobbying and cutting down
[SPEAKER_03]: the forest repeatedly, we are denaturing
nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: The soil lenses are becoming thinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: The carrying capacity becomes lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rule of nature sees the carrying
capacity of this ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens?
[SPEAKER_03]: Diseases, starvation, unlearned disease,
and in our case, wars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water tables are lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And directly after the forest is cut,
90% of the carbon is coming from bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: After 70 years, 75% of the carbon is
coming from fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the predominant reservoirs of
carbon for global warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not the soil as much as it is the
fungi in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we are looking at today, we have only
10 to 15% of the wood debris residents in
[SPEAKER_03]: the forest today.
[SPEAKER_03]: 70% of the soil is carbon-closed microbial
mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30% of the soil is home.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are predominant reservoirs storing
carbon to offset global warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is stored in the bumble tissues of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I spent a lot of time in the Old West
Forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: We collect mushrooms in the Old West
Forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wipe my eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where I like to go to church on
Sundays.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got very interested in the antimicrobial
properties of mushrooms because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: scanning up microscopists and
microbiologists.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm really interested in the antiviral
properties of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I learned an article for Herbal
Ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of you know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Surveying all the scientific literature
for what is out there, in scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: literature on the antiviral properties of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I surveyed the literature,
and there's a whopping one page.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like seven articles in the entire
scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And two photographs take up about half my
page, socially, about half a page of
[SPEAKER_03]: references.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I published this in June of 2001,
the Herbal Ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 9-11 occurs in September 11,
2001.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the BioShield and BioDefense Program
was funded by George W.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bush for several billion dollars because
agreements start up in 9-11 that not only
[SPEAKER_03]: airplanes fly into buildings, but
terrorism, especially bioterrorism.
[SPEAKER_03]: Viruses don't care about the borders.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you can have custom agents trying to
intercept nuclear, you know, radioactive
[SPEAKER_03]: material, but viruses spread by enemy,
by contact, airplanes, trains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Auditoriums, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the BioShield and BioDefense
physicians saw my artworks at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were very eager to find out remedies
to protect, you know, global citizens from
[SPEAKER_03]: bioterrorism, especially from anthrax,
which is a dumb bioterrorist weapon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only it hurts the people that it makes
contact with, or one arm's reach away.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a virus, somebody had smallpox in this
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in a matter of a few hours,
a huge number of people would be infected
[SPEAKER_03]: with smallpox.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we started going through experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, looking at the scientific literature,
most of the experiments were done with
[SPEAKER_03]: group bodies, the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had this keen sense of epigenesis
and the organization of mycelium being
[SPEAKER_03]: able to navigate through hospital
environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, I started focusing on the mycelium
and comparing mycelial extracts versus the
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms that keep the mycelium,
comparing these extracts and challenges
[SPEAKER_03]: against bacterial pathogens and also
viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: This article came out a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It shows specifically that more genes
co-op where the mycelium is growing than
[SPEAKER_03]: where the mushrooms are growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot more genes for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to defend against all these
pathogens they're trying to consume.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mushrooms are as fleshy as the food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, people eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're washed for a few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's immune system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as intact as a long path the
mycelium takes to navigate through the
[SPEAKER_03]: microbiome soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there's much more protein-coating
genes are activated in the mycelium than
[SPEAKER_03]: there is in the group bodies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we look at the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mycelium activates into a baby
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turns out that blue light
stimulates mushroom formation,
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically the 320 to 400 nanometer
range.
[SPEAKER_03]: The absence of this blue light,
the mushrooms are stunted and they often
[SPEAKER_03]: come from a form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we started working with our culture
collection and we submitted thousands of
[SPEAKER_03]: samples, literally, to the BioShield
BioDefense Program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had an extraordinary result.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the result that was extraordinary at
first, the most extraordinary,
[SPEAKER_03]: was the garakon, the one they held up at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fungus also sufficient balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we started collecting the garakon
strands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have been collecting them since the
1980s because it's such a rare mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one time, a hundred times,
I was going to get the old one,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are valleys where I can find a
cluster of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, literally, my professor, Dr. Michael
U., has spent 40 years collecting
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: He found his first garakon at his life two
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes out many times through the
course of a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: He found his first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they can be extremely rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're quite common in both islands,
you know, going up in the Inland Pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much more so than elsewhere because
of the old growth forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we went out and we went collecting for
these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we went up to Desolation Sound and we
found this very, very beautiful place
[SPEAKER_03]: where there is a giant agarikon that was
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the place that we found this agarikon
also had a strange rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: This rock was extremely shaped like an
agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, here's an agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, we're like, this is very weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, we collected specimens of that
location.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes we had them go up high up in
the trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is a large agarikon on Cortez
Island coming from a dead branch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly, it has not brought the
branch that supports it through this hard
[SPEAKER_03]: rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And an agarikon can have two forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can have the one that's fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the dark brown color.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then it has the ghost form.
[SPEAKER_03]: It transforms into this whitish fruit
body.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's called the planite planos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this was the first reported by
Diasporides in 65 A.D.
[SPEAKER_03]: The very first material that I got.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was called Unixerium adlonum,
by the elixir of long life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Subtively presented as a treatment against
consumption, later to be known as
[SPEAKER_03]: tuberculosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, when Dr. Scott Grant, featured here,
saw an article I wrote on the agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he saw that it was used for treating
of consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the director of the tuberculosis
research laboratory at the University of
[SPEAKER_03]: Illinois in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, he contacted me and said, Paul,
I'm a tuberculosis expert, funded by the
[SPEAKER_03]: Gates Foundation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're real interested in XDR-TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: All things from the strain reductivitis to
the strain to myphyturic tuberculosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I really wish I was working with
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Scott and I started working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started collecting agarikon screens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we have 75 screens of agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're by far the largest screen library
in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collected from the United States and
Canada, and also some small islands in
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought those agarikons were large,
so I sold this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, whoa, that is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I had four slides that got mixed up
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what happens with these new
computers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Touch something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in the passage of Desolation Sound,
I was approached by National Geographic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to do a story on agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they wanted to come out in the
wintertime.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it was so fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we went out the evening passage of
Desolation Sound, and they wanted to know
[SPEAKER_03]: how likely is agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, no, 50-50.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just made a note.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, infinitesimally small.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're likely going to find it,
but I don't want to discourage them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I took 10 of my friends, and I took
them up to Desolation Sound, high powered
[SPEAKER_03]: computers, and we looked for snacks that
looked like a big bee's nest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of them were bald eagles for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we looked for bald eagles and snacks
and see if we could find an agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, we came to that rock that you saw
earlier that was shaped like an agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, we couldn't find an agarikon,
and we got really tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our skipper said, let's go to a first
donation site that's sacred.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one really knows what the pictographs
mean, but let's go there and have lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it was east of the island,
and we go over there, and we're exhausted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, one of my TGP's said,
there's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found an agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one's unusual because it fell
from the branch.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had carted it onto another branch,
and then it moved two legs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mice then moved back into the tree,
and it was still alive, and it moved two
[SPEAKER_03]: legs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we were ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_03]: The National Geographic writer was
ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we went on our mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found a new discovery of an agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did not want to go to a place that
we'd already been to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, let me explain about what I know
about the indigenous use of agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Haida people, Charles F.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaw is an Argelite plate from 1894.
[SPEAKER_03]: It speaks of the origination of ethnic
women.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Ravens happened on the Sea of
Eternity.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's indigenous people here that know
this story a lot better than I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, please forgive me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Raven is specifically in the quest to
find Archon Callium as a woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no one can help Ravens here on the Sea
of Eternity.
[SPEAKER_03]: To find her genitalia, except for Pongus
Man in the back of the canoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: This white-eyed character.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, an agarikon can have these
columnar forms that Northrop Coast First
[SPEAKER_03]: Nations people, these would be carved and
drawn to the graves of shamans to help the
[SPEAKER_03]: shamans navigate into the afterlife.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, a good friend of mine,
Nujal, and the advisor of the audience,
[SPEAKER_03]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I went up to see Nujal and his
family, I felt like I was carrying the
[SPEAKER_03]: ancestral knowledge of agarikon from Greek
culture, from the work that I had done,
[SPEAKER_03]: to bring them back, you know, this is
ancestral knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Nujal, after some days, he goes,
you know, you gringos think we know
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frankly, we had two flu pandemics,
two smallpox pandemics, each of which
[SPEAKER_03]: wiped out the majority of our people,
especially the elders.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had great ancestral knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a pictograph that was on that rock
where we found the agarikon with two legs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're able to get these cultures,
these mushrooms in the culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we began a very painstaking
process of what's called bio-guided
[SPEAKER_03]: fractionation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking two solvents, taking a pole,
older solvent, water, and a non-core
[SPEAKER_03]: solvent, like hexanes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And different solvents will separate out
different constituents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in bio-guided fractionation,
like with Scott Branswell, what we did is
[SPEAKER_03]: that we would fractionate out the,
make an extract with the mycelium or the
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit body.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd take out the two fractions,
and then we'd test each of them against
[SPEAKER_03]: tuberculosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whichever one tested stronger,
then we knew going down to the decision
[SPEAKER_03]: tree, let's follow that solvent sequence
to see if we could find an acidized
[SPEAKER_03]: constituent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did this, we worked on it for about
seven years.
[SPEAKER_03]: After seven years of bio-guided
fractionation, literally hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of dollars, we found
anti-tuberculosis compounds resident in
[SPEAKER_03]: agarikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is really important because
these chlorinated cobalt roots turn out to
[SPEAKER_03]: be highly active against XDR, TB,
and far more potent than the positive
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-tuberculosis controls.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Mycelium Bio-Defense Program,
when we worked with them, we also did
[SPEAKER_03]: bio-guided fractionation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the course of our research with the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Defense Department, we found that agarikon
also had anti-viral compounds,
[SPEAKER_03]: besides the antibacterial compounds,
tuberculosis and bacteria, that's highly
[SPEAKER_03]: against active against viruses,
including smallpox.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can google my name, Sam,
this is Smallpox, National Public Radio.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a very impressive list from the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Defense Department.
[SPEAKER_03]: This specifically states that of the
several hundred thousand samples that were
[SPEAKER_03]: analyzed, our samples were the top 10 of
all products analyzed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mycelium, it turned out, was active,
the fruit bodies were not.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mycelium had far more anti-viral
effects than the fruit bodies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that they were the only national
products out of more than two million
[SPEAKER_03]: samples submitted that had such
significant activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we go around, we will look for us,
we collect these, we get them from the
[SPEAKER_03]: culture, we don't have to collect them
ourselves, we get a small piece of tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: and we grow it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So working with the University of
Mississippi, just like we did with Scott
[SPEAKER_03]: Bransfield from the Tuberculosis Research
Center, we started doing fractionation.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the active molecules against
smallpox?
[SPEAKER_03]: And who's out for a big haul?
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have discovered that agrarian was
active in smallpox, but we didn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had no history of contact with smallpox
until the Europeans introduced it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we ended this bio-gantt fractionation
five to seven years later and we found two
[SPEAKER_03]: active anti-smallpox molecules,
sulfuric and hemiburic acid, over twice
[SPEAKER_03]: the activity of sedatum, here,
the positive drug control, and without the
[SPEAKER_03]: same toxicity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, now smallpox is not an emerging
concern, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've been immunized,
in the last case, the smallpox infection
[SPEAKER_03]: was a few decades ago, but clearly the
concerns were flu viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the flu virus started becoming a
really pressing danger, the Bioshield
[SPEAKER_03]: Biotech Program said, well, we test your
samples against flu viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it said, great, we already have the
samples, let's go ahead and test them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we then sent samples, a number,
not identified, to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: government, the Bioshield Biotech Program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an example of some flu pandemics
and the rate of mortality is promptly high
[SPEAKER_03]: in some of these, especially with H5N1.
[SPEAKER_03]: H7N9 is now a version of H3N2 and flu B
viruses, so it's been going around
[SPEAKER_03]: recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, did you see the activity index?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that has two or more is active,
anything that has 10 or more is extreme.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a measure of testing for an
antiviral drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is truly amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: government paid 2,392 assets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a deep debt of gratitude,
ironically, to George Bush, who didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never thought I would ever utter those
words.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the summary of these results of 2,392
assets are two examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four of them turn out to be
extraordinarily active.
[SPEAKER_03]: Against H3N2, against herpes influx virus,
H5N1, and compared to ribbomyrin.
[SPEAKER_03]: See the activity index, anything over 10
is active.
[SPEAKER_03]: These ribbomyrin is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got up to the activity index of 100.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at our extracts,
35% ethanol.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are human cells, altered in little
wells.
[SPEAKER_03]: They add to the little extracts of 101.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this becomes really important later
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, our extracts pollute 101 with water to
a 1% concentration in order to get rid of
[SPEAKER_03]: the alcohol if the alcohol is toxic to the
human cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, 101 dilution of our extracts are
selectivity indexes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're stronger than a pure pharmaceutical
drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the mycelium is active,
the muscle fluid is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this resulted in a panic that was
finally born in 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are three criteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, no prior evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, it has to be unobvious, especially
people who speak against your investment
[SPEAKER_03]: prevention.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I have a shout out to all my critics
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you criticize me, the more you
say, it won't work, Stannis doesn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: My personal trust is, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can use that for my patents because I
have expert teaching against my invention.
[SPEAKER_03]: It proves unobviousness.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third is uselessness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Benjamin Franklin could not have invented
the cell phone because there's no cell
[SPEAKER_03]: phone towers or uselessness.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, these are the three criteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the patent discontinued.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2004, I would normally have showed up and
had my own page of applications by 2006.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2008, 2005, 2009, the patent is not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk to my patent attorney and go,
where is the application?
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be posted by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We quit the patent because the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Defense Department hijacked the patent
because of national security, because of
[SPEAKER_03]: smallpox, because of pandemic flu.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we had an intergovernmental agency
trace, we pulled back the patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, after negotiations with the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Defense Department, they finally said
okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the patent was issued.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's great because two of the
particles came out of scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: literature talking about agaricon having
antiviral properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people discovered, 80, 10 years
later, after I did, that agaricon is
[SPEAKER_03]: highly active against flu viruses and
other viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all this was, you know, okay,
that's, you know, maybe these surveys,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's interesting, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then this article came out,
and it blew me away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns out that Tamiflu, which is a very
billion, multi-billion dollar drug,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is based on Shekemi acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shekemi acid comes from the Starhannis
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically from Afghanistan and that region
of the world, you can imagine supply chain
[SPEAKER_03]: is difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why there was a big flu,
the threat, a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tamiflu disappeared because it was very
difficult to get to the beef stock,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Starhannis, because there are no arms
in it once a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns out that blue light stimulates my
cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stimulates my cell to make the
precursor of Tamiflu, Shekemi acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can make precursors for Tamiflu 24-7 by
stimulating blue light under my cell.
Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this now has resulted in an
experience, spurring our research into
[SPEAKER_03]: antiviralists, and I'll come back to this
in just a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the most involved study of
mushrooms in the world was turkey tails,
[SPEAKER_03]: Tremé's bericicolor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called bericicolor because of the
variable in color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turkey tails are well known throughout
Asia for supporting the immune system.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an application with the National
Institutes of Health, and I was a
[SPEAKER_03]: co-investigator, co-PI in providing the
application.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were awarded $2.28 at the University of
Minnesota Medical School.
[SPEAKER_03]: My co-author said, well, Paul,
we got this money, where should we get
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, please, the chain of custody is so
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the original test tubes,
we have the original cultures,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have a multiple chain of custody.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be the supplier and the
co-investigator.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I was hired as a co-investigator.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put us into a pool of other suppliers
to see who would be chosen and who would
[SPEAKER_03]: be best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully, we were chosen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what I'm going to show you now is,
it's better for me to show this to you
[SPEAKER_03]: than re-review it, but this became really
important to me in 2009, when my
[SPEAKER_03]: 83-year-old mother called me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a charismatic Christian.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had doctors since 1968, and she had
rapidly developing metastasized breast
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here is a five-minute full video of
her story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another mushroom empowers the immune
system, and this is turkey tail.
[SPEAKER_03]: This had come to me very personally in
June 2009, when my 84-year-old mother
[SPEAKER_03]: called me up and said, Paul, I have
something very serious to talk to you
[SPEAKER_03]: about, but you're always so busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a terrible thing to hear from a
mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, mom, what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a very happy, genuine person.
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, I'm worried.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my mother's a deeply religious Nazi
and a doctor since 1968.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said my right breast is five times the
size of my left.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have six swollen lymph glands the size
of walnuts, and her voice started shaking,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm not ashamed to admit that I
started crying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you tell me sooner?
[SPEAKER_03]: We spent a large part of June at the
Swedish University of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: The oncologist examined her, and upon
second examination, she had a 5.5
[SPEAKER_03]: centimeter diameter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It metastasized.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to her sternum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to her liver.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had stage four breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The doctor gave her less than three months
to live.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, it was the second worst case of
breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is seen as a doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been 20 years of practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to circle a family meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of you have gone through this.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom announced that she bought a pine
casket, the cheapest one that she could
[SPEAKER_03]: find, because she was going to have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the doctors have no utility.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have your breast removed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's an interesting study on turkey
tail mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to medical school.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to try taking those.
[SPEAKER_03]: My son supplied those, so she was put on
taxol and perceptum, wonderful drugs,
[SPEAKER_03]: and she started taking maybe turkey tail
capsules a day, four in the morning,
[SPEAKER_03]: four in the evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was in June of 2009.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, my mother has no good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw my mother yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's almost 93 years of age.
[SPEAKER_01]: After five years,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was no detectable tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite well cured, but physicians
consider it to be a very good sign.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when she got the news from her
physician that she no longer had to be on
[SPEAKER_03]: treatment, she left me this.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mother is sharp as a tack.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the results of our clinical study are
summarized here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a phase one study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Statistically significant increase in CD8
and T cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: The P value, if you know about statistics,
anything that's 0.05 or less is excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.01 is really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 0.0003, and higher doses of turkey
tail are associated with a more rapid
[SPEAKER_03]: recovery of lymphocytes and NK cell
activity, often times damaged by
[SPEAKER_03]: chemotherapy or radiation therapy,
which my mother cannot have radiation
[SPEAKER_03]: therapy or her breasts removed because
they're at age that was from infection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was published in a phase one
clinical trial in a very beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: oncological journal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a number of other articles came
out that found that turkey tail combined
[SPEAKER_03]: with her septum makes her septum work
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two interviews with the
oncologist that was treating my mother and
[SPEAKER_03]: also with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the oncologist told me, I was
interviewed and answered questions that I
[SPEAKER_03]: did not even ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: She never suffered from campy brain,
the dulling, the fog from the use of
[SPEAKER_03]: chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she never had loss of appetite.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are two quite significant features
that were associated with my mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of interest in turkey
tail, mushrooms, and polysaccharides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of misinformation has been put
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: These polysaccharides are beta-glucans.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're large sugar molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they activate immune response based on
an infection model.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a normal pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You consume your immune system response.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an inflammatory response.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to show you a more
sophisticated way of looking at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a beta-glucan molecule,
3D.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a huge scaffolding, but it has a
molecular weight of oftentimes thousands
[SPEAKER_03]: of kilodaltons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this articulates, this really
makes a mushroom have a scorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are structural components,
like the wood in the wooden house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, attached to the scaffolding of the
beta-glucans are many other compounds,
[SPEAKER_03]: including protein, polyphenols,
and lipids in particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you use different solvents,
you can break these other polyphenols and
[SPEAKER_03]: proteins and lipids away from the
beta-glucans scaffolding.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are huge macromolecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all sorts of end branches.
[SPEAKER_03]: They then have embedded with them also to
the constituents.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can remove them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very interestingly, a particle came
out using lipases that took the lipids
[SPEAKER_03]: away from the beta-glucans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it took the lipids away from the
beta-glucans, it decreased the immune
[SPEAKER_03]: response or volume of PSK by, in this
case, about more than 83%, showing that
[SPEAKER_03]: beta-glucans, yes, they're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they alert the immune system because
of TLR2 response.
[SPEAKER_03]: But without those lipids, then the immune
response is not as great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really, really interesting to
me, because in particular, polyphenols and
[SPEAKER_03]: these lipids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I worked again with the National
Institute of Health Morology Department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of a complex story,
but I'm going to show you our recent
[SPEAKER_03]: results this past year with NIH neurology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found that these polyphenols that
are associated, again, with the
[SPEAKER_03]: beta-glucans will be separated one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found five polyphenols highly active
against the human papillomavirus,
[SPEAKER_03]: HTV.
[SPEAKER_03]: 45% are menhav, 75% are women.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are oncoviruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oftentimes, they're leading to cervical
cancer, esophageal cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the actual, if you follow my
cursor here, this is a directive of NIH,
[SPEAKER_03]: National Institute of Health, highly
active.
[SPEAKER_03]: These five polyphenols that were embedded
in a scalpel in the beta-glucans were
[SPEAKER_03]: extraordinarily active against HTV
viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that I just kind of
stumbled into.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really honored.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm excited that this past month,
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patent Office has now granted me my first
patent on molecules against HTV.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is also resident within these
extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the general message here is that
mycelium offers you a deep well of
[SPEAKER_03]: immunoactive substances, antiviral
substances, antibacterial substances.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can fractionate down the lung
constituent, but you can also fractionate
[SPEAKER_03]: away the complexity of the ecological
benefits that it gives you as a whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we are complex organs that
benefit from a complexity of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to now full circle back to
the B shaman, which I had mentioned
[SPEAKER_03]: before, and the use of honey to preserve
magic mushrooms, you know, we discussed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But many of you may not fully appreciate
the benefit that bees give to our global
[SPEAKER_03]: food supply.
[SPEAKER_03]: Biosecurity in the world is now in
imminent danger due to the loss of honey
[SPEAKER_03]: bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's about 81 billion bee hives in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: China being number one, Turkey,
the U.S., Iran, Argentina.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the loss of bees is a direct threat to
food biosecurity that is increasingly a
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when a friend of mine, Louis
Schwertzberg, a filmmaker, came to me and
[SPEAKER_03]: knew of my other research with insects and
against viruses, he said, Paul,
[SPEAKER_03]: what can you do to help the bees?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I started focusing my attention on
bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is a bee flying to pollinate
tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one bee can visit 1,000 flowers a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the absence of bees now in the
landscape is due to a confluence of
[SPEAKER_03]: factors where you see bees on flowers the
last days of their lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bee flying to pollination used to be on
average nine days, and now it's five.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's an extremely high half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here is your food supply benefiting
from bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have bees, this is what your
dairy supply looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bees won't pay alcohol for clover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if there's a memorandum came out of
President Obama specifying some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: stressors that are causing bees to die,
it would be poor nutrition, lack of
[SPEAKER_03]: poison, and mites, viruses, and
neodyminoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this chart really brings it home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in the United States, this is the
loss of the annual bee die-off this past
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: 72% in Oklahoma, 74% in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you look at the national average that
goes up and down depending on the regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is neodyminoid drift coming from
corn, farms, et cetera, or back of an
[SPEAKER_03]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the neodyminoids are having a
disastrous effect on the bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bees are associated with planet
corn in particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: The use of neodyminoids is skyrocketing in
agriculture comparatively in the past 20
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the neodyminoids are increasing the
sperm vitality of the male-drawn bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, myostrates, which are very much
promoted by Barrett and other big
[SPEAKER_03]: companies like Monsanto, interfere with
the cytokine pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that all animals use.
[SPEAKER_03]: They use the cytokine pathway to detoxify
compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you interfere with that pathway,
you have hyperaccumulation of these toxic
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I was studying this problem with
the bees and looking at it and thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about it, an article came out in PNAS.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a open source journal that found
that the honey that was in the beehives
[SPEAKER_03]: had been abandoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those of you who don't know about
beekeeping, when these bees disappear,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not like there's lots of dead bees
around the hive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go out on a Monday, you check your
hive, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go out on Thursday, they're all gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: There may be a few dead bees, but 30,000
to 50,000 bees have left and they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it turns out when they analyze the
honey in those abandoned beehives,
[SPEAKER_03]: they lack P-chimeric acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, P-chimeric acid comes from the
delictive medication of wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also in lots of grains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But absence of that, the bees cannot
detoxify.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is one of these symptoms of what
is putting a stress on the bee population.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by far, the biggest stress is the
deformed wing virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: The deformed wing virus now is a pandemic
that spread across the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came from Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is now virtually all bees in the world
were infected with a slew of viruses,
[SPEAKER_03]: including the deformed wing virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2016, there's a number of articles
talking about its prevalence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Covert infection of the deformed wing
virus causes the bees' wings to have less
[SPEAKER_03]: strength.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're not able to forage as long,
and they end up not being able to come
[SPEAKER_03]: back to the nest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the introduction of the broil mice in
particular has spread the deformed wing
[SPEAKER_03]: virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: The broil mice are like, they bite the
bees like a dirty syringe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is now considered to be the leading
contender of colony collapse disorder,
[SPEAKER_03]: venerated by the broil mice.
[SPEAKER_03]: The broil mice is being controlled by a
mitosol called amitrax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amitrax is used for killing ticks on
cattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's approved in the United States
specifically to control ticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been used off-label by beekeepers
to control the broil mice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five years ago, two drenches of amitrax in
a bee hive were seized.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was typical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now beekeepers are drenching their
hives seven or eight times because of
[SPEAKER_03]: mitral developing resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so 100% of the honeybees now worldwide
have been infected with the deformed wing
[SPEAKER_03]: virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bee collapse is happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called a bee pock-a-wutz,
because of the rampant spread of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was confronted with all this
history that you've heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was laying in bed, and in a waking
state, between being fully asleep and
[SPEAKER_03]: waking up, I discovered in this state of
dreaming, that is a perfect time to come
[SPEAKER_03]: up with solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had an epiphany.
[SPEAKER_03]: My epiphany progresses through the
following experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was growing a garden giant mushroom,
1984.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put the garden giant mushroom up in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two bee hives.
[SPEAKER_03]: I come out in July.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look very closely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I move the wood chips to expose them to my
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bees, they're sitting on the little
x-rays.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next form that's happening is coming
from my ceiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for 40 days, a continuous group of
bees walked my garden giant mushroom back
[SPEAKER_03]: to my bee hive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept the diamond on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were, you know, in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bees were preferentially going to my
garden giant patch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucked the mycelium, so the patch shook
to about a third of its depth over 40
[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I published this in 1988 in Harrisburg
Magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1993, one of my books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thereupon, I forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this next slide is a little bit
complicated, but as the mycelium grows,
[SPEAKER_03]: it produces enzymes, and the mycelium
stops growing and exposed to light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enzymes are stopped being produced,
and B-chimeric acid stops being produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: It struck me that, and in reference to
that, I think the bees were uncovering the
[SPEAKER_03]: mycelium that was in the dark in order to
get access not only to sugars,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also the B-chimeric acids that were
activating their detoxification pathways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhat speculative, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one event that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1983, 1984.
[SPEAKER_03]: I walk up to the old growth forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see bear-scratch trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bear-scratches.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bear-scratch trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Resin comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bees are attacking the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting populous.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bees use the patch for hives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm walking up to the old growth forest
in the South Port-au-Haut living
[SPEAKER_03]: peninsula.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come up to the corner, and my wife and I
see these big bear-scratches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bam!
[SPEAKER_02]: Scratched!
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's oozing out this resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told my wife, you know, bear-scratch
trees in the state of Washington harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: of the timber under the schools,
and my neighbor killed 400 bears under
[SPEAKER_03]: contract by the government because the
school systems want to be threatened by
[SPEAKER_03]: bear-scratches because with the
bear-scratch trees, polypore mushrooms
[SPEAKER_03]: grow out of the trees and kills the tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So humans are so adept at choosing
amongst, you know, the rest of the issues
[SPEAKER_03]: of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years later, oriented through the
Olympic National Forest, no trails.
[SPEAKER_03]: After four hours, we found the tree,
and there's the bear-scratch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lo and behold, the red-delted polypore
had popped out of the wound.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started doing these experiments and
going up to the mycelium, and I contacted
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington State University saying,
I think I have an idea here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because our antiviral research with our
shield-bound defense program about how to
[SPEAKER_03]: help the bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked the researcher there just to
bear with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I laid out my hypothesis,
and he said, don't go anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to work with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started going up to mycelium,
and we made Michael honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is mycelium that's grown on rice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we make this really sugar-rich syrup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we fed this to bees at the
Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four replicates on our bees in a cage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we feed them a 1% to the 0.1% and 10%
sugar solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm going to upload it as one of
the ones that you see right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the beekeepers do is they feed
sugar water to the bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our idea is we put these extracts of
sugar water to feed the bees to see if it
[SPEAKER_03]: would happen in fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did this research at Washington
State University.
[SPEAKER_03]: We surveyed about 20 different species,
specifically looking at longevity and
[SPEAKER_03]: antiviral properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the red-belted polypore, the one
that's introduced by bearers for us from
[SPEAKER_03]: the trees, the amadou, which my hat was
made of, the red raceteen, which was
[SPEAKER_03]: highly active in the bioshield program,
also against flu viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chaga was also very active against flu
viruses in the bioshield program.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these stood out as big prime
candidates.
[SPEAKER_03]: The red-belted polypore amadou,
it literally doubled the lifespan of bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bees lived through the average of about 30
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time of their foraging,
after about a week, that time was the most
[SPEAKER_03]: important time to bring the polypore back
to the nest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a number of bees that were surviving,
statistically significant, showed a nearly
[SPEAKER_03]: doubling of the bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Steve Shepard says that at the
moment, there's 39 years of bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not aware of any reports that have
helped to understand the life of bees
[SPEAKER_03]: before the nest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started doing other experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we conducted experiments with 532
beehives in the almond orchards of
[SPEAKER_03]: California, the largest bee study in
history.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to show you now a short
little clip on some of those experiments
[SPEAKER_03]: we did with Washington University and the
bees in the almond orchards.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Steve Shepard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a professor of entomology here at
Washington State University in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Entomology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I work in honeybee genetics and
evolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honeybees are by far the most important
pollinators for agriculture, approximately
[SPEAKER_04]: a third of the crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think bees are properly recognized
for the economic benefit they get to
[SPEAKER_03]: society.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think increasingly they will be
recognized as bees become more scarce and
[SPEAKER_03]: food prices climb.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here with these beautiful almond
orchards, one of the most bee-dependent
[SPEAKER_03]: crops in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the almond industry knows in
particular that without honeybees,
[SPEAKER_03]: crops are a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's many fruits and berries,
nuts, that are dependent upon bee
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the last decade, honeybee pollination
populations worldwide have declined
[SPEAKER_04]: drastically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beekeepers and scientists have been
working to try to find out what's the
[SPEAKER_04]: cause of this decline.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the leading problems facing
beekeepers today is the boromite.
[SPEAKER_04]: These mites attach to cells to bees,
feed on their blood, feed on the worm and
[SPEAKER_04]: transmit viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boromites are very good at developing
resistance to chemical treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beekeeping industry had a couple of
compounds that they used pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: extensively originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really just a matter of time
before mites develop resistance to that
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here is a sick bee.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see her wings are deformed.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a symptom of varroa and the virus
called the four wing virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This colony is not going to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though there are bees here now,
this has been destroyed by varroa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these dead larvae that are
very little.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a tremendous need to develop
methods to control boromites that are
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainable and don't rely on the use of
chemicals, allowing beekeepers to get off
[SPEAKER_04]: of a chemical treadmill.
[SPEAKER_04]: I became aware a couple of years ago of
some work my friends had done called
[SPEAKER_04]: Stamens.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had some fungal extracts and mushroom
extracts that had antiviral properties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea then became to use mushroom
extracts to attempt to control the viral
[SPEAKER_04]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: The extracts we're using are coming from
the living tissue of this mushroom when it
[SPEAKER_02]: was alive called the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're seeing that these mushrooms
are essentially longevity of bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think bees are critical to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pollinate more than 110 varieties of
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This orchard that we're standing in is 800
to 1,000 acres and every single one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those blossoms need to be fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a timely manner all at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: This research experiment that we're doing
I think is the largest beehive experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: ever conducted in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: 532 beehives testing the effects of these
extracts and helping these survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're doing is we are sampling
these beehives to check virus levels and
[SPEAKER_04]: then we're also treating them with
mushroom extracts, which is what we're
[SPEAKER_04]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the beauties of the fungal
extract for controlling the viruses in
[SPEAKER_00]: honey bees is the ease of use for
commercial beekeepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to handling products like
this as far as mixing something into their
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar syrup and feeding it to bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple to adopt.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hope is that this research will give us
a very important tool in our biological
[SPEAKER_02]: toolkit to help save biodiversity and
ecosystems on this planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If our ecosystems fail, what do people do
for food?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is fundamental to saving our
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping that people recognize
mushrooms for the important roles they
[SPEAKER_02]: play in the ecosystem of which we're just
now beginning to discover before it's too
[SPEAKER_03]: late.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we conducted the experiments with
thousands of hours of research.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to show you now the
conclusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: of this research.
[SPEAKER_03]: On Tuesday, we submit our paper for
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a common achievement of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, I hope will go down in
history for I think this could be the most
[SPEAKER_03]: significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the mice transferred lots of viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: All queen bees now, unfortunately,
have the black queen cell virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mice feel the extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the mushrooms, the mice will extracts
reduce the black queen cell virus in seven
[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: 500 to one, greater than 500 to one,
the ratio of chaga.
[SPEAKER_03]: The very two same species that reduce
viruses that affect birds, pigs,
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The anti-viral effects of amadou mushroom
against the deformed wind virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amadou reduces it greater than 800 to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The B value of significance is fantastic,
but even more fantastic is racing against
[SPEAKER_03]: the deformed wind virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: The B value of significance is point zero,
zero, zero, zero, one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone who knows about statistics,
this is extraordinarily convincing data.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most extraordinary result,
however, was against the lake cyanide
[SPEAKER_03]: virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Producing with racially extracts from
mycelium, not the food bodies,
[SPEAKER_03]: produces lake cyanide virus more than
45,000 to one, with B value of
[SPEAKER_03]: significance of point zero, zero,
zero, zero, five.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no reports of anything that
produces B viruses until our discovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is amazing because also, it's orally
active.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes past food digestion, past the
microbiome of all the bacteria in your
[SPEAKER_03]: gut, past the acids and the enzymes,
past the cyanide-borne people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: pathway, entering into the bloodstream of
the beast, doubling the lifespan,
[SPEAKER_03]: and significantly reducing the multitude
of problematic viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the second most well-studied
animal in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're number one, bees are number two.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an animal clinical study.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all grew up with Winnie the Boo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all knew that bears go to bees that
nest in trees with hollows.
[SPEAKER_03]: But astonishingly, there are no reports in
the scientific or popular literature of
[SPEAKER_03]: bees being attracted to mycelium because
of immunological benefit, or antiviral
[SPEAKER_03]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The extracellular metabolism of the
mycelium, again, not the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mycelium is the immune system of the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It benefits the bees by bolstering
immunity, reducing viruses, striking wing
[SPEAKER_03]: lifespan, increasing stand-off in
foraging, providing sugars, vitamin Bs,
[SPEAKER_03]: and lipids, helping to fight fungal
bacterial infections, providing endomeric
[SPEAKER_03]: acid, for activating the cytokine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pathway supports the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_03]: These mushrooms are prebiotics that help
the beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then reducing the toxicity of
pollutants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Astonishingly, I file patents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I file patents because it's a lot of work,
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You build a house, you get credit for
building your house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I build this intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get credit for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I plan to open source it all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And made it open source now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Monsanto and others.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have companies that use it for green
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important to commercialize it in
order to create the revenue stream that I
[SPEAKER_03]: promised to be able to benefit the
commons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the patent's now been issued.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday, the European Patent Office
issued for like 20, 25 countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been issued in the United States,
Australia, Europe, excuse me, Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: New Zealand, and Eurasia.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a phenomenal discovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our fellow researchers are giving talks at
bee conferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are joining the mushroom community and
the bee community together.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first presented this data three
years ago, when we only had 10 to 1
[SPEAKER_03]: reductions of viruses, could not optimize
the formula, I gave a shout out to 900 bee
[SPEAKER_03]: scientists and professional beekeepers in
the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: As in anyone here ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are seeing or written that mushroom
extracts will reduce viruses in bees,
[SPEAKER_03]: please stand up now, Tommy.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a pregnant silence.
[SPEAKER_03]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patent Office, the European Patent Office,
WIPO, the World Intellectual Property
[SPEAKER_03]: Agency, have done mass researches in
Chinese, German, English, French,
[SPEAKER_03]: every language.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no one has discovered this until now,
but me?
[SPEAKER_03]: For about three seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, three seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my life's down.
[SPEAKER_03]: She discovers that there's paradigm
shifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am horribly depressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am hiding in plain friggin' sight,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are Neanderthals with nuclear weapons.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are more in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So independent of whether a scientist
discovers an antiviral molecule,
[SPEAKER_03]: or independent of whether a scientist or a
medical doctor or physician, determining
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have an illness due to a disease
caused by microbe, or if you're a shaman,
[SPEAKER_03]: who say you have been seized because of a
spirit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The common bridge between those two is
that diseases can be caused by something
[SPEAKER_03]: in the unseen world.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is full circle to First Nations and
First People's belief.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the spiritual, in the physical value of
nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nature is a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_03]: A multiplicity of variables on one side of
the equation leads to success or failure
[SPEAKER_03]: on the other side.
[SPEAKER_03]: The complexity of the factors that
confound us today are seemingly
[SPEAKER_03]: insurmountable, I think, in some way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to reinvest into the deep well of
knowledge of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are literally solutions all around
us hiding in plain sight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We submit our article to Science on
Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a high impact journal.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that is scalable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is ecologically rational.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, through the concerted effort of a
great team of people, it can use native
[SPEAKER_03]: species anywhere in the world where there
are forests.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can amplify these species using
indigenous specimens.
[SPEAKER_03]: The racial strain that we use came from
Quebec.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that is teachable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it opens up even something
more important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned to you that the Mamadou
mushroom was the first mushroom ever to be
[SPEAKER_03]: discovered to have an anti-bio properties
against the Tobacco-Pose virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: We now know there's another vector that's
spreading the deformed wind virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in Holland, but out of the mines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nature is interconnected.
[SPEAKER_03]: This affords us the opportunity of being
able to mitigate diseases in plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can lower the viral burden and the
vectors that transmit these viruses
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in our partnership with Washington
State University, we have now contributed
[SPEAKER_03]: over $150,000, my wife and I, and through
a lot of you who have supported
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuffelgrass and my company, this money is
going back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say this, folks, just because
it's so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday was the first day in my life I
became debt-free.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no debt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no partners over my wife,
and I have no partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I created this company because I was a
little boy in the laboratory of my
[SPEAKER_03]: parents' basement with my brother John,
and I always dreamed of being a scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm living my dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to worry about being fired
from university because I talk about the
[SPEAKER_03]: Stone Age Hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't worry about the fact that I can
trip on salt water once a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this opens up the possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not be defeated by the impression of
the news, of our society in the short-term
[SPEAKER_03]: preoccupation with social media and their
devices.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trolls are so vicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: These people hide behind anonymity.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have the guts to stand up and
be held accountable for it, and they get
[SPEAKER_03]: so much attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, folks, this art is going to take
back our future.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can take back our future by respecting
nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indigenous peoples knew it so well,
or know it so well, the concept of seven
[SPEAKER_03]: generations, thinking about the impact
that you have today on the impact of the
[SPEAKER_03]: generations in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: You make all the money you want in the
world, and you can't take it with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the heritage that you will leave?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that my life in discovering these
keys to new doors will be opportunities
[SPEAKER_03]: for future generations to walk through,
to make discoveries that will help us
[SPEAKER_03]: overcome success.
[SPEAKER_03]: The solutions are economically skilled,
easy to deploy, ecologically rational,
[SPEAKER_03]: and can be immediately implemented,
except it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bees are considered livestock.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the United States, we cannot make the
anti-barbaric claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Canada, you can't, but New Jersey does.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have hired lobbyists to go to
Washington, D.C., and I have spent several
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred thousand dollars to convince the
USDA to give an exemption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thankfully, two of our co-authors
are USDA neurologists, Dr. Jay Evans.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of the co-authors, the premier
beer beer beer, bee virologist,
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to hear it, bee virologist with the
USDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of our co-authors, along with Don
Lopez.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the WSU, we have the USDA as
co-authors, and so we're going to do a
[SPEAKER_03]: petition for an emergency exemption in
order to take this to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to reframe a concept of
decomposition.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to celebrate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to let it rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all gonna rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get used to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna emerge back into the mother
vessel for which we evolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're stardust, we're plumbed together in
this short lifespan.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an assembly of ill molecules and
microorganisms that exist in symbiosis,
[SPEAKER_03]: but will scatter back into the heavens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe matter becomes life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Life becomes single cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: Single cells become strings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Linearly, they fork.
[SPEAKER_03]: Men range more.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all exist in the fabric of nature
throughout the cosmos.
[SPEAKER_03]: My university is about biosecurity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humans, trees, bears, mushrooms,
the birds and the bees, all terrestrial
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms that evolved being
interconnected with my soil, wetland,
[SPEAKER_03]: and wildlife.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now think of the implications.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were forced over millions of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started putting down the force,
we started getting away from our origins,
[SPEAKER_03]: our roots, literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same fungi that helps the bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: It produces viruses, birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pigs, humans, plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can engage my solutions to create a
paradigm shift in nature that strengthens
[SPEAKER_03]: nature, not in opposition, but in support
of it, in collaboration, in community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I invite you all together to recognize
we all live together, all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our molecules will mix together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within the micrometer matrix of the
universe.
I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to thank you all very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
