[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the Simpsons dank runner,
but what from the Simpsons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes stoner Smurf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but what is the actual what is it
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're getting a little closer Ralph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Ralph What what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the Simpsons Valentine's Day Yeah,
yeah That's it Simpsons Ralph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the way I would answer that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is is it was Ralph getting a
Valentine's Day card That said I chew chew
[SPEAKER_00]: choose you I can't remember if it was one
he gave away or if it's one he received
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's the one he received from Lisa
It's the one he received from Lisa because
[SPEAKER_00]: she never he never got a Valentine's Day
card poor fucking Ralph You know how nice
[SPEAKER_00]: of Lisa to sort of see that Ralph was
hurting and to send him a card because
[SPEAKER_00]: even the local cops kid needs some love
and There's a lot to be said in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these Simpsons episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you know all taken From the
social context that is life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She broke his heart But first she tried to
save his heart and that was the lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: She put herself out there She tried to
offer him some sort of you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it came back to be that he was a
little bit more annoying than previously
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of Let's have a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some Congo today She's a good chick
Right, it's been a while I watch an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode every once in a while with my son
my 14 year old son likes the Simpsons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, it is a fab egg behind me look at
that Here Let's see if we can get this off
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be a little bit stuck and I did just
heat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might have to do a little bit of
There we go Gotta love the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: transference of quartz allowing us to do
such things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit the fab egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall we I
[SPEAKER_00]: Think it's great Tara.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great
[SPEAKER_00]: Tara's call talking about Whitney
Harmony's new glass banger unbelievable
[SPEAKER_00]: concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's put frit Inside the bottom of the
banger He's encased another banger into
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of the banger so it's like a
cup within a cup and basically the fret
[SPEAKER_00]: acts as a timer then you can It changes
color as it gets hot and then it changes
[SPEAKER_00]: color back again As it loses its
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it can do is and this is a very
cool concept It can train you to hit your
[SPEAKER_00]: dab instead of from a timer From color
from a color sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it was fucking cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's innovative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the innovation of These
glassblowers and the stuff that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an end user.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even more happy Will I have one in the
very near future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got on the second list.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first list was was hammered out
actually I'm not using my phone for this
[SPEAKER_00]: first time so I can actually show you guys
if the phone actually wanted to work
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just hate iPhones But not
always let me see if I can find Whitney
[SPEAKER_00]: Whitney Harmony glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so here is the unit right here
and That's he's doing a giveaway go check
[SPEAKER_00]: him out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see his account is if I can get it
to focus Whitney Harmon Whitney Harmon
[SPEAKER_00]: glass Whitney Harmon glass go check him
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super cool concept really really
cool concept I Thought about the torch
[SPEAKER_00]: with the laser thermometer all-in-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a good idea still I I
thought about it, but honestly like I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know I think this is cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is way cooler It's sealed in
quartz I wouldn't be too worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the quartz can breathe and
things can get through I'm not a big
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fan now Big wave today and topanga.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you know with what bomb rip
tasted like It tasted like another one
[SPEAKER_00]: drew I know exactly what that bong rip
tasted like because I'm constantly taking
[SPEAKER_00]: that bong rip Let's get a little bit more
cleaner on the banger a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that get missed sometimes when you
have a really big banger it's easy to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of miss a section here and there and Do
not want to let the chas Hang out for any
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one that thinks that That is not such
a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Chris, you don't even know bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know I have video of The
final piece and now it's a short video
[SPEAKER_00]: like two minutes But I am going to be
releasing it in the very near future
[SPEAKER_00]: because let me tell you it is awesome Just
the piece the quality of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some pictures up on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check them out at BC bubble man
But the video going close up and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the absolute Insane quality of the
glass and how much it pops in the Sun I
[SPEAKER_00]: was a little disappointed This apartment
that I went to photograph in was very not
[SPEAKER_00]: sunny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sun had already gone behind Yeah,
you totally missed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucked it all up, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn Adam smokes a lot just joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't fuck anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you miss anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you miss me giving something away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did give something away But I gave
that away before it was even that before
[SPEAKER_00]: anything went down In here, so it was an
impossible one to live to win unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: said that it was the pizza from the kiln
How cool was the pizza from the kiln was
[SPEAKER_00]: that not a funny experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see him pulling this shit out and I'm
like, oh shit Yoshi Yoshi's pulling some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out over there I I'm sneaking up on
him kind of and then I look over his
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulder is opening the tin foil I'm
expecting some some cool glass something
[SPEAKER_00]: something I've never seen some new
technique that involves tin foil But he
[SPEAKER_00]: opens it up and it's pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's cooking his fucking pizza in the
kiln, of course Of course he is Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Kondo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, dude it was unbelievable that
whole video I am happy that everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoying it as much as they are and let me
tell you There is some good enjoyment
[SPEAKER_00]: happening on that particular video I
wonder if
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom just in case I'll send that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I end up meeting yesterday as well with
Dr. Natasha and her husband David that was
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice little hangout session we sat by
the boats and Puffed some bowls out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this really cool little piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had he basically had I Put it way over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know the vape exhale bomb actually
I have a vape exhale right here I can show
[SPEAKER_00]: you so if you know the vape exhale bomb
the bomb that has the base with the hole
[SPEAKER_00]: in it This unit right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a couple of different models But
basically it feeds the unit feeds right in
[SPEAKER_00]: through here Well the other day these guys
had a handheld battery unit with a ceramic
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl that fit right into here So it was
like a battery unit that fit into here and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you the rip that I got off those
of that thing was was actually Very
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive for you that don't know the
vape exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the unit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cool little unit Maybe one day
cyber will give us one of these to give
[SPEAKER_00]: away a kind of a cool unit to share with
the audience but You can go and purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: on your own from vape exhale and save
those an awesome dude Even if you just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to learn about the unit, it's
definitely worth the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie They don't all come in
pelican cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them fairly cheaper than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oh good job 70s mama That's a lot of
work getting those tents up if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: guessing what kind of tents you put
yourself up I took a few down just the
[SPEAKER_00]: other day and It was it was work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure No, no ants on my rig
today, but Keep an eye out to keep an eye
[SPEAKER_00]: out anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can of course recognize any type of
bugs I'm going to reward you with great
[SPEAKER_00]: with a great gift of some sort So if you
see one climbing on my hat if you see one
[SPEAKER_00]: climbing on my shirt If you see one inside
my bong if one goes in the bowl while I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing I mean that's potentially worth
like a million bucks You could literally
[SPEAKER_00]: get a million bucks transferred into your
account e transfer I'm sure they do e
[SPEAKER_00]: transfers up to a million bucks these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Just being silly dab to this nine-pound
tastes like grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Amelia Lavender We'll dab to
that getting great rips from a bubble bag
[SPEAKER_00]: vapes feed in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome Peter s I'm happy to be a
part of your journey You will not probably
[SPEAKER_00]: see any tins of eagle 20 behind me there
are no eagle 20 tins in my home But boy,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would that be worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: The portable electric nail I don't know of
a port.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh the one that I had wasn't really a
nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to find out from David if he's
maybe he's in the chat or dr. Natasha I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if they're in the chat right
now, but I was a really cool little unit
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeing as I already have a couple of
the pipes I wouldn't mind getting one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those little pieces to modulate my battery
with because It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dogs barking in the background Not sure
what at but I definitely am NOT going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be yelling at him to shut up He can just
bark all he wants bark bark bark bark It's
[SPEAKER_00]: what dogs do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of their version of being like
hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we hanging?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we chilling?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: probably there's a stranger in my house
right now because he doesn't really bark
[SPEAKER_00]: like that for any particular reason,
but What am I gonna do?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's barking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm gonna have another puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get the torch going There we go
other pop yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah really sorry to hear all these people
All of these people going through these
[SPEAKER_00]: fires right now probably not just in
British Columbia, but all over but
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely British Columbia has a lot of
fires right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of over the top All right,
here we go Little bubble hit hitting some
[SPEAKER_00]: gods green crack this time around Hitting
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it is someone is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why my dog won't shut up There are
people in the other room while I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode Maybe they'll come in they'll
hang out do a dab with us They'll be in
[SPEAKER_00]: for a surprise if they do let me tell you
People love the avid a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forbid an eagle for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's some fucked up shit,
dude People gotta stay away from that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff On commercial printing your
pictures, I've done it in the past Savage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've G clayed them, you know people They
just I don't see a huge market for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have people contact me and they want
photos I Sell photos I lease photos if I
[SPEAKER_00]: print them they cost More obviously
because a G clay itself big enough can
[SPEAKER_00]: cost, you know I've spent upwards of 500
bucks on a nice G clay Like a four foot by
[SPEAKER_00]: five foot or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh mine's inclined.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like a little like toy poodle crossed
with a shit suit He's a ship who in fact,
I
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't promise on any signatures if you
bump into me one day in life And and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a pen and you have something you want
me to sign my god I will sign anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like a hundred things but I find when I
make people the promise something simple
[SPEAKER_00]: like that It ends up becoming more
difficult than it should be and like the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that should just be shipped
Doesn't get shipped and then it just
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't all work out and it fails So in
regards to will I send you anything
[SPEAKER_00]: signed?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't want the responsibility Don't
mean to sound like a dick and be
[SPEAKER_00]: disagreeable But come to an event that I'm
at come to the karma cup or one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cups or one of the lift Events or
come to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all over the fucker Map just come meet
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sign anything you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem except over like control of my
business and house and whatnot But I will
[SPEAKER_00]: hey what's going on from Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Will I just you know what if it's yeah
get exactly in Joe That's what I that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I like to do promise nothing give all
when I make a simple promise like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay I'll sign your thing I end up
forgetting I end up not doing it or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know for the instance of the gentleman Who
asked recently who wanted me to sign the
[SPEAKER_00]: book the book that I gave away of Dana
Larson's was the only thing I have not
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally shipped I've shipped everything
myself Dana shipped the book Dana lives in
[SPEAKER_00]: the city 40 minutes away from me I don't
see Dana very often at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two or three times in a two to three
month period I might see Dana So when he
[SPEAKER_00]: asked me could you sign it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try but it's unlikely, you know,
and then Dana hit me up the next day
[SPEAKER_00]: saying I should The book I knew that it
wasn't gonna happen and in that experience
[SPEAKER_00]: it taught me that I shouldn't be promising
anyone Any type of signatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, if you win one of these mornings Adam
you'll get yourself a hat if It happens to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a hat and you happen to give the right
response or happen to share this the right
[SPEAKER_00]: energy or happen to you know Say something
that is funny and and grabs me in a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain way Absolutely, but otherwise nada
Yeah, Drew it is sold in California
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries and I'm not sure when we're
gonna do Colorado because that enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: involves building an entire Facility in
Colorado, of course, you can't ship things
[SPEAKER_00]: over state lines We need to have the
facility in Colorado processing resin
[SPEAKER_00]: that's grown in Colorado and we have
partners there and we have the Ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it, but we're really just trying to get
our feet up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's release, California Let's show
everyone what we're about and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: recreate The Hope sure I can do that tiny
chat calm backslash French Hatties pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go You can punch that into your
Google and it'll come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elliott.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice to play with dry scripts
screen dry sip screens That is a
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership sticker on this pelican behind
me this is a stack of pellets behind me
[SPEAKER_00]: One two three four And there's a couple
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing like flab go follow flab
four two one You got to see his pelican
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely insane insane Your
partners in Oregon already too.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not really John.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had conversations with a few people
We're always down for working with good
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are doing things We usually
just pick that small percentage of people
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are focused on you know,
biodynamic farming and the symbiosis of
[SPEAKER_00]: the root bacteria like soil balance is
talking about and living soils with
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizomes and All of these sorts of things
that allow for the plant to express itself
[SPEAKER_00]: at a higher At a higher level of terpenes
and cannabinoids and whatnot These are the
[SPEAKER_00]: people we want to align ourselves with the
people that are understanding that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know growing biodynamically and
organically and you know really allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to express itself That's where
we want to come in and process that resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be the mass process We
want to be the processor for the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are producing the highest quality
product And those are the people we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to promote even more so than our brand We
will promote the people who grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that we process because they they
are everything they're doing everything
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The processor is a very short percentage
of time over the course of that plants
[SPEAKER_00]: life from seed to finish Oh, well,
you know lots of people grow with salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I I don't I think that you can grow
some Herbs using the salt growths.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just believe that the Sun and Organics
and the symbiosis of living organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding for and on the plant will produce
a higher quality expression That's
[SPEAKER_00]: unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just can't be compared now that
doesn't that's not on the market right now
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's not available to
people so things like mostly salt-grown
[SPEAKER_00]: Newts are the ones that are are
popularizing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trust me I'm sure you can Willie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to check out with the company
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Thanks Kiwi Carrie, thanks just try and
keep it real just try and keep it truthful
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I kind of was had a good
conversation with a guy today who we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about Tokyo smoke and he said You
know, they're really not bad guys and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll probably end up getting some good
traction out of this this nightmare Fiasco
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had with vice these are of
course the guys that say There's no
[SPEAKER_00]: original bombs and the in the pipe making
industry and that their metal 3d printed
[SPEAKER_00]: space metal By pipe for $13,000 is going
to be the new future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously these guys are somewhat
disconnected from the scene But they're
[SPEAKER_00]: reconnecting to a new scene that isn't the
scene and I understand that but you know
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it without completely insulting
an entire industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just sort of talking about that
that concept of like coming out and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know trying to Represent an industry
while insulting the entire industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really that was really a crazy
fucking crazy fucking thing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a sweet dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sweet dragon and this is a
pretty nice dragon and I get it It's hard
[SPEAKER_00]: not to make fun now, but you know,
I have met Alan on a few occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually a really nice guy and it was
unfortunate that that it got that it came
[SPEAKER_00]: out like that that they just said the
things that they said and the editing and
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it came out was just like oh,
that's just Terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be You can't do such a thing
Yeah, they're not bad guys trust me
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not bad guys at all They're
actually pretty good dudes But they just
[SPEAKER_00]: came across really douchey in that in that
particular video and they did kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: insult the entire industry in there coming
across as douchey so Adam smokes a lot if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to get in touch with me get in

than when it did on the phone But maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: another dab will loosen The gift of debt
of gab I need to just do a quick little
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanup because my last dab is still
actually sitting in there somewhat dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good sign of a pretty strong
dab When you go to take your next hit and
[SPEAKER_00]: your bowl still has the oil Floating
around in it from the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bad sign Love cleaning the
banger love Not having it chas out on me
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, I have a feeling this dab may
again taste like another you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they constantly do Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're enjoying your Hercules.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing it's the one that I sent you
That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool Wow, it's cool that
that the more stuff we give away the more
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes itself out to all these different
places around the world and Eventually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hopefully we'll cover we'll
cover all the four corners Of cool little
[SPEAKER_00]: gifts that we've passed out Damn love the
dark crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah me too t-minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, Benny sheets those guys are next
level dosa as well all four of those
[SPEAKER_00]: glassblowers I can't pronounce Daisuke
Daisuke's name Daisuke Saito, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: Yoshinori Kondo and Junichi Kojima who is
aka Rose Rhodes Really really really
[SPEAKER_00]: talented individuals I love what I love
about it is what I love about Everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do in the fact that the things that
I'm good at hash making isolating resin
[SPEAKER_00]: heads I'm good at it because I pair I pay
careful careful attention Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in and I was paying more attention
Ahead of a lot of people and then teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: other people how to pay attention and how
to become aware Has been a learning lesson
[SPEAKER_00]: for me because as I teach I realize all
the things I don't know and I go out and I
[SPEAKER_00]: seek that knowledge And I want to learn
more and more and there's so much that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know about these Components and
these this plant and the resin that it
[SPEAKER_00]: produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure eventually one day to the stuff I
don't know about cannabis will fill a
[SPEAKER_00]: small library.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even a big library So I'm definitely
looking at it as I'm still the student
[SPEAKER_00]: Even as I try to fit the shoe sometimes as
I don't like to say teacher but share
[SPEAKER_00]: Facilitator of knowledge, you know,
let's all learn this knowledge because
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually some really fucking smart
people are gonna gain It and when they do
[SPEAKER_00]: the next step of the next knowledge the
deeper level that we need to go into may
[SPEAKER_00]: be unveiled So what do I think of Jerome
Baker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Jerome Baker, you know,
originally I met Chris oh geez like It
[SPEAKER_00]: must be 20 years maybe more than 22 22
years ago is when I first met the main
[SPEAKER_00]: blower I'm spacing right now actually a
little bit because I called him Chris and
[SPEAKER_00]: now I'm like doubting that that's his name
and everyone used to call him Jerome Baker
[SPEAKER_00]: and Anyway, one of you guys will put up
his name and then I'll feel terrible I've
[SPEAKER_00]: known him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of crazy that I'm spacing on
his name, but I like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like his you know, it's different It's a
different level and style of glass people
[SPEAKER_00]: used to love that shit back in the day He
was you know, when I first met him it was
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1995 and he was in the back of Adam
Dunn's place, which was I want to say it
[SPEAKER_00]: was the KGB Jason exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know why I called him Chris,
but yes Jason Was there he had his long
[SPEAKER_00]: hair and I got some video footage of him
He was blowing a glass pipe and it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: KGB Adam had just closed the CIA which was
cannabis in Amsterdam and the KGB which
[SPEAKER_00]: was his new incarnation was called no KnoW
good buds and it was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's been on church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely Jay Harris exactly You know why
I called him Chris but yeah a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: good dabs of some sativa some narrow leaf
drug cultivars and that'll occur although
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, actually the last one I took was
that God's green crack and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely not a narrow leaf drug cultivar
It is very strong and narcotic and could
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously put people to bed Excellent a
pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been sharing it for almost 20
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been paying attention if
you've been out there listening the
[SPEAKER_00]: Information has been what I would consider
fairly widespread even though tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: people still don't know exactly About what
water hashes how the concept works,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the things to sort of stay away
from Yeah, I still not sure why I called
[SPEAKER_00]: him Chris it's kind of funny He's gonna be
like dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw you on your wake a big call me
Chris I get I better actually contact him,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Cuz that's a good when you know
you're getting old and you haven't talked
[SPEAKER_00]: to some of your friends in too long when
you start mistaking their names Oh Yeah,

[SPEAKER_00]: of all of this activism and dispensary
world that Yeah, it's pretty cool to have
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys in here man waking and baking
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a hit for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's hit the Let's hit the climb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit the climb Heat it up Nice say
hello to the BPG folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you I found a Rolodex recently I
don't know where the hell I think I put it
[SPEAKER_00]: up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found my old Rolodex from like I don't
know it's like gotta be close to 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: old and It opened up on the BPG and
Debbie's personal number and it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like I she seriously must have written
that in there like a year after they open
[SPEAKER_00]: that place Just kind of cool Alright,
let's hit this little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going back in for some Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Just hit something special no wonder I
saved it that's the way dude I love that
[SPEAKER_00]: one of your one of my most amazing and
it's kind of funny because it goes back to
[SPEAKER_00]: joints And I haven't smoked joints in a
long time Before I started the bubble bag
[SPEAKER_00]: company the night that I got busted and
arrested with sixteen and a half pounds at
[SPEAKER_00]: a roadblock I ended up staying the night
in the West Vancouver jail and they
[SPEAKER_00]: impounded my car And the next morning I
released myself on my own cognizance in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end It was a very very chill
experience other than having to spend time
[SPEAKER_00]: in jail And
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the price you pay for practicing
civil disobedience prior to these great
[SPEAKER_00]: legal platforms and systems Mechanisms
being put into effect How we get those
[SPEAKER_00]: into effect as we practice civil
disobedience?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was practicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got caught I got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Spent the night in jail I lost all my
pounds But on my way home, I noticed that
[SPEAKER_00]: they had left my ashtray in the car and
back then I used to smoke a lot of joints
[SPEAKER_00]: and leave the roaches in the ashtray Well,
there was this big fat roach in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ashtray and I was driving home and I was
kind of choked and pissed off about having
[SPEAKER_00]: all my pounds taken and having the Letting
down the compassion club and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: busted and having to go to court and
losing money and all this crazy shit You
[SPEAKER_00]: know being pretty stressed out about it
actually and I opened the ashtray as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting out of West Vancouver driving up
towards Horseshoe Bay and I see this big
[SPEAKER_00]: roach There's a whole bunch of little ones
in there, too But I see the big one and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I wonder what that is and I I've
just put it in my mouth and I push the
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarette lighter in and I like that joint
and If it wasn't the fucking haze it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a pure haze joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I inhale And as I exhaled I
realized everything is going to be fine
[SPEAKER_00]: stop reacting To this experience do not
give them any more power than they've
[SPEAKER_00]: already taken from you And from that
moving from that moment on I started
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at it as a valuable lesson instead
of a costly mistake and that's led me to
[SPEAKER_00]: Start the bubble bag company start fresh
headies start promoting Isolation of
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichome heads start educating
people do macro photography Start my
[SPEAKER_00]: youtube channel hash church all of that
comes from being arrested one night at a
[SPEAKER_00]: roadblock with cannabis So, you know
Sometimes if you're really looking forward
[SPEAKER_00]: to change You know and you manifest this
rock bottom That's kind of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best change you can ever manifest not
saying that I was really rock bottom But
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a bummer for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my lowest of my low it was a little
scary low lower than I like to go and
[SPEAKER_00]: There's real comfort in that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking About it today actually in
how you have these two sort of worlds
[SPEAKER_00]: where they you have this money world this
world of people who want to become
[SPEAKER_00]: Involved with cannabis that have never
become involved with cannabis and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have this cannabis community people who
have been very very much involved and are
[SPEAKER_00]: very connected and feel very somewhat
possessive about their connection with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that they you know, some people
feel like they kind of own it and I get
[SPEAKER_00]: that and So the real value in those two
groups in the future will be what in
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematics is called the semivesic Which
is when the two circles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersect there's a third little area
right here and that little area is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a very valuable area if you can
communicate with both sides of that group
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you can create the buffer zone
that's going to be needed for this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry to expand beyond the simple
division that we've been suffering from
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks to Prohibition and we haven't done
much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a colonial mindset This
prohibition mindset is so ingrained in us
[SPEAKER_00]: that even now As we get legalization we
fight against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fight against the mainstream being
involved We fight against it being allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: on a larger level and we want to somehow
protect our little baby from getting out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the nest and spreading her wings and
You know touching the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's uh It's pretty trippy I think
that we're in for a neat surprise in the
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the upcoming years of Cannabis
prohibition crumbling and falling and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going to replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to fall easy they're
going to constantly try to replace it with
[SPEAKER_00]: a more corrupt version of itself,
but We've already crumbled the most
[SPEAKER_00]: corrupt version of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the foundation will soon
follow we have a very incredible group
[SPEAKER_00]: that is now willing to say I use cannabis
and some of them are children and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are elderly and Some are female and
some are male and all races and all
[SPEAKER_00]: genders and belief systems and it's
incredible before there were only a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain group of people who are willing to
stand up and promote the use of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and those people were looked at it was
easy to make those people look like
[SPEAKER_00]: degenerates Because we were willing to be
arrested for what we believed in and in
[SPEAKER_00]: society It's like the laws are supposed to
keep you in the corral so having this
[SPEAKER_00]: group of individuals who think they can
just do something and not Face the
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences sort of freaks society out
quite a bit However in any sane society
[SPEAKER_00]: when a law makes no sense whatsoever It's
up to the good people of the society to
[SPEAKER_00]: stand up to practice civil disobedience
and to not allow them to You know direct
[SPEAKER_00]: What is right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the truth?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know because lies are lies and that's
the shit that I can't Whatever your truth
[SPEAKER_00]: is If it changes then change your truth
and let people know but you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of line There's a lot of
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's why people I Hope it's why
people enjoy these wake and bakes because
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be genuine I try to be myself and
I try to be as truthful as I absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: can I went to college for a very short
amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it University same same I took
some things I didn't last very long my
[SPEAKER_00]: college was psychedelics my college was
reading on my own and Between my own
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic use and between my own reading
and absorbing of knowledge and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions with smart individuals You
know hanging out what in my life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out the things you want to get good
at and then hang out with people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: much better than you at those things So
those are the things that I practice
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's playing pool Whether it's
trying to learn guitar whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: isolating resin heads Whatever the things
that you're passionate about driving a
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt bike or a snowmobile or a snowboard
Hang out with the best of the best of that
[SPEAKER_00]: group and you will quickly learn at an
exponential rate the things that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn about and so that's kind of even
for photography, you know same thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take anyone special now the
more you pay attention and the more you
[SPEAKER_00]: focus to what's going on The more aware
you are the faster And quicker you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to absorb the information Accurately
to what it is you're trying to learn if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're spacing out and you're not paying
attention and you're the text guy and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the MTV flash flash generation you
might have a harder time in Focusing and
[SPEAKER_00]: being hyper aware and being you know
noticing listening to what you're learning
[SPEAKER_00]: and then applying it the way you learned
it certain people are Exceptional at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and other people can't do it to save their
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy but For me, it's what it's my
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to just hang out with people who are
much better Try to find people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing things that you're inspired by but
doing it at a higher level and you too
[SPEAKER_00]: will climb quickly The last run I did a
bubble hash geez it probably would have
[SPEAKER_00]: been Maybe within the last six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a couple of batches here and there
I've done some batches in the tropics in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica And I've done a few local batches
just little Small batches bigger ones in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica, but soon we'll have some batches
coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have We'll do some Some good video
of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys saw that we made
an announcement in Jamaica today Maybe I
[SPEAKER_00]: should read it the announcement is United
Cannabis Corporation and cannabinoid

[SPEAKER_00]: of products in Jamaica And so yeah,

[SPEAKER_00]: Ministry of Health I'm going to Jamaica
next week with Tony and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: train doctors on how to use prana and To
prescribe prana and what it can be sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: used for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very huge We're fucking super excited we
have an acre right now that's looking
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly good in Jamaica and soon we'll be
able to process this into medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant many many more acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie We're pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be fucking sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, we'll have some videos from
Jamaica Hopefully myself and Tony and I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe Ernie is gonna be there as well

[SPEAKER_00]: the current CEO So we're really excited to
be able to show you whatever we can and
[SPEAKER_00]: show you the vape pens come in Thomas It
should be here at the end of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got less than two weeks left for
that all the packaging They've been
[SPEAKER_00]: ordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're currently being manufactured all
the oil and the terpenes have been
[SPEAKER_00]: produced and ratioed out and are just
waiting for these applicators and Pens to
[SPEAKER_00]: come in so we can fill them up and those
will be available through the bubble man
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand through harborside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping Berkeley patients group is

[SPEAKER_00]: some other spots that I'll let you know as
well as weed maps is going to be getting
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs and links to all the accurate
places like LA Kush and The real green
[SPEAKER_00]: dragon two places in LA that we're
processing for right now So we want to let
[SPEAKER_00]: people know the legitimate places that our
work is going to be found and we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: very vigilant in exposing people who are
claiming to sell stuff from us that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: from us Toaster grow I gave away the karma
cup pin today and I gave away the turp
[SPEAKER_00]: proof, which is basically rosin PTFE like
sheets probably safer than parchment and
[SPEAKER_00]: we gave it to Mind something nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he said he came in and said and
the answer is it's the pizza from the kiln
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely made me laugh and I
figured what is a better answer than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate having a Contest I hate making it
like seem like we're winning I'd rather it
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like you were chosen and that you
didn't really have to do anything for it
[SPEAKER_00]: except be you and have your sense of humor
and So that's what we did How about this
[SPEAKER_00]: for a beautiful story to finish it off
with and I hope that it's not too
[SPEAKER_00]: personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that it is D o g o g
remember his father.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was David pop poser poster His
father was on his deathbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's passing away now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He remembered I didn't know much about
him, but I gave his dad a shout-out Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: he wrote me this really beautiful email
and he said hey there bubble man I first
[SPEAKER_00]: want to say thanks for your kind words I
want to give you a little story to go with
[SPEAKER_00]: my father's name My father was born in
1947 and got to experience some really
[SPEAKER_00]: neat times and always loved plants and
flowers He raised me and my brother by
[SPEAKER_00]: himself and helped me learn and grow
teaching us that honesty respect and love
[SPEAKER_00]: were the base of our being He Did this by
living his life this way every day
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis was and will always be one of his
greatest passions more than Cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea of sharing some really good herb
with the friends that you kept was the
[SPEAKER_00]: reward I felt that this idea of sharing
parallels to what you talk about with the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of plentiful not scarcity He first
saw the Grateful Dead in 67 and at the age
[SPEAKER_00]: of eight took me to my first dead show
That was 1992 at Star Lake amphitheater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fortunate enough to see them again
in 1995, which I'll never forget the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gloria encore So we got to experience a
lot together.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was diagnosed With chronic lymphatic
leukemia and when I was 12, he was given
[SPEAKER_00]: three months to a year two weeks from that
day We got a call from a different doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: who informed him He was a candidate for a
stem cell transplant This gave us the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years together and allowed me and my
brother to grow up having an excellent
[SPEAKER_00]: example Of how we should live aloud and
and be and treat one another Everybody is
[SPEAKER_00]: every day is blessing My name is Jason and
I take value out of your wake and bakes
[SPEAKER_00]: and enjoy the first changing hash Church
the ever-changing hash Church first wake
[SPEAKER_00]: and bakes I wasn't working and glad I got
through And hearing you talk about my
[SPEAKER_00]: father brought me much joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Appreciate the pin and will wear it with
the cool story it holds I also thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for the hash knowledge that in turn will
help me become a better grower the
[SPEAKER_00]: learning never ends So how fucking cool is
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you step out you do things for a
reason and there are doors that open up
[SPEAKER_00]: because of it This is the real shit in
life that seems to be hijacked by you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the fakeness of creating a person and
making that Person famous so that when
[SPEAKER_00]: people are supposed to be opening doors
with one another the ones they've actually
[SPEAKER_00]: manifested into their life they get
hijacked by John Travolta or whoever
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking that that's a person they need to
engage with the people you need to engage
[SPEAKER_00]: with you would never Fucking guess so
Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you bro for sending me
that email It was very touching teared me
[SPEAKER_00]: up the first time I read it I'm not gonna
lie and it's even kind of tears me up when
[SPEAKER_00]: I when I read it to you guys It's just a
good Way to connect a lot of this internet
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of this You know Way of connecting
that's different than in real life and
[SPEAKER_00]: true face-to-face person this connection
through the internet a lot of it has been
[SPEAKER_00]: Made to be less than and if we can make it
more than by making it sort of a more
[SPEAKER_00]: special connection Connecting with each
other a little bit more Than just through
[SPEAKER_00]: a quick little buzz on a wake and bake
video then man, that's fucking Awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: puts a smile on my face inspires me and I
know that inspires you guys as well That's
[SPEAKER_00]: it mine's inclined starts with the beat
ends with the beat starts with the breath
[SPEAKER_00]: ends with the breath Probably with the
first beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty heavy Yeah, Jack Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie job less you just come
in none of these none of these wax You
[SPEAKER_00]: just make it in come on cannabis,
Oregon Thanks for coming in heading back
[SPEAKER_00]: to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace brother like to find a way to
Connect this community more than this
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Larry Dunnington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first way is to be simple Don't
look at the huge picture like you you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like start locally start within
yourself connect within yourself with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant learn as much as you can and then
you know naturally as you start talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis you'll connect with people
that you pull into your life and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: find the direction that you're supposed to
go in through these coincidences that are
[SPEAKER_00]: really coincidences and Robert Anton
Wilson has a book he coined the phrase the
[SPEAKER_00]: coincidence so I don't want to take any
Credit for that but it is the coincidence
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you have these coincidences,
you will see these experiences Replicating
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves into your life in different
ways where it's like, okay, I'm supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to experience this This is what's supposed
to be happening It's a great way to lead
[SPEAKER_00]: your direction if you're really lost and
you don't know what direction you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice way is to follow the
coincidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen the same person a stranger in
your life three times in one day Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're either the D A investigating you
or more likely they're a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: person that you've manifested into your
life and vice versa and you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to connect this is another
valuable thing that the DEA loved to fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: with by taking away that trust and by
creating paranoia people would manifest
