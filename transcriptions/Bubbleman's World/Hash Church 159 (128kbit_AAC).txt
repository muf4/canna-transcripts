[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's going on everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's 149.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am here with Samurai Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam High is in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dude, you're kind of the main reason
Hash Church is happening today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam made it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam made it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I got some ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my friend Keegan.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to maybe do a CO2 run.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice to have that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could talk about the fires.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, listen, if you can make it
easy and we can go live, I am absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does say that there's no viewers
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are live.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little bit, little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we got to 27 and we're starting to
come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little nervous there for a couple
of seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was happy I could come up and try
to make something a little easy for you
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully some of the ideas play out
and we can have a good chat about
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that people, yeah,
look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Woody, Woody, cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam saved the church.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and Subcool's on the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he's on the way,
but I am going to invite him.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I should invite everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't I do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even, usually I send the links
out almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was here distracting you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were, it's all your fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's your fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all my fault today.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that we're having hash church,
the fact that I didn't send out the links.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can blame it all on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam drives all the way up from Bellingham
just to keep church going.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: How fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a, it's a fun drive up,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live on a beautiful highway out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: From Seattle now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not close.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little further.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working down out in like West Seattle
now doing the hydrocarbon extraction game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't even sure if anyone was going to
show up because it was pretty much the
[SPEAKER_03]: last episode last week, but there's
Etienne.
Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your trip?
[SPEAKER_15]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nutty.
[SPEAKER_15]: Fun.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you can see my pictures.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been posting them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love your pictures, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do appreciate you traveling and
posting your pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always like, damn, Etienne's like a
real photographer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets right in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's taking pictures of moose and shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of wildlife and I've the right
lenses, you know, when you got a 100,
[SPEAKER_15]: 400, you know, it really helps in getting
right in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, yeah, I was very fortunate that
nature showed up and it was really the
[SPEAKER_15]: first time trip I've had with my mom solo,
me, my girlfriend and her went out and
[SPEAKER_15]: spent a nice week going around the,
uh, Yellowstone.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, but unfortunately while we were away,
we know that, um, holy hell sit loose here
[SPEAKER_15]: in California and, um, shout out to sub
cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know he lost his farm.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, shout out to spark.
[SPEAKER_15]: They lost their farm.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were able to save their house and
numerous other farms have been lost.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, we're going to be doing various
benefits and stuff here real soon.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, we have a venue, um, and we're working
on a date and we're starting to pull bands
[SPEAKER_15]: now to try and get a little relief for
people and have a little bit of fun,
[SPEAKER_15]: but, uh, it's going to be a long time.
[SPEAKER_15]: The fires are still burning.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shout out to all the first responders and
firemen and, uh, their supporters who are
[SPEAKER_15]: out there right now, making sure as many
families and farms are saved as possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: So much love, huge shout out to the,
you know, the first responders cause
[SPEAKER_15]: they're on the ground doing it every day.
[SPEAKER_15]: And unfortunately the death toll is
climbing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's 40 now and it's going to rise.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, there's really no alert system here in
Northern California to deal with the
[SPEAKER_15]: amount and as fast as that fire started to
move.
[SPEAKER_15]: So right now, yeah, right now we're just
trying to assess and find everybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's hundreds of missing people right
now that we're just trying to give our,
[SPEAKER_15]: our best wishes to and shout out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we hope the, you know, the very best,
but it's dire here in Northern California
[SPEAKER_15]: right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: And until these rains come, which don't
look till next week, it's, um,
[SPEAKER_15]: only going to continue cause not many of
these fires are near a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_15]: containment in any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely part of the conversation
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've invited in soil King.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if he's going to make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I invited sub cool in and, uh,
Sam here as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to make sure that we discussed,
uh, just putting out all the right
[SPEAKER_03]: information for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they know where the proper go funds me
are, where you can put your, your
[SPEAKER_03]: attention and your energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to help, uh, these people that
have, you know, just utter and complete
[SPEAKER_03]: devastation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, in the meantime, welcome to Dr.
Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, thanks for showing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got his guitar on his, on his arm and
Hey Sam, what's happening, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, two Sam's in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skunk man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing sir?
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess he's trying to get his mic.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just juggling his mic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're such a gentleman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, I don't think you need to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she's, I think she's good to go
the way she is.
[SPEAKER_03]: No roping out the women.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sam getting kinky all of a sudden,
huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's getting something on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam's always got the best humor though,
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you want to step out of your
reality just for a second.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you need a bone pipe, I know what
you know, where to find him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you got a pipe there in your hand
Etienne.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what's happening right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hitting, we're hitting dabs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, it is how last time I
checked Hash Church and I've been away a
[SPEAKER_15]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I got some catching up to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: So starting off with a shout out to us,
uh, of course skunk man Sam, cause I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: smoking some, uh, haze here.
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoked some beautiful haze last,
uh, yesterday with Dr. Natasha and her
[SPEAKER_03]: husband David.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and it was, uh, it was really,
really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Della haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope, uh, Dr. Natasha gets on today and
we can talk a little bit about that
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, Sam, it's good to see you,
sir.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I popped into that third anniversary
episode at the very, very end and didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have a chance to say very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Marcus was kind enough to invite me up
and I'm thrilled to be here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wasn't there unfortunately for the
three.
[SPEAKER_15]: So happy to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, Sam really, uh, kind of made
the episode happen today.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came up with a bunch of different,
uh, kind of conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And concepts to invite some new people in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that'll happen here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to invite Keegan in to talk a
little bit about his CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you puffing on gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're puffing on some new come right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, pretty gift from the maple butter
boys out East.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I also have a little bit of a
full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's actually not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like probably more than it really
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, well, man's telling me he's got
almost no hash and I just see Graham after
[SPEAKER_02]: Graham.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just got these little jars and I'm
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm down low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say, and then we got John's,
we got Johnny B's Medi Kush somewhere that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to squish on the M1 at one
point in time today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason S is that your son B man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I look that old?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I look that old?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam is my son.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sam, you've grown so fast.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I cannot tell you, you know,
what are you feeding him?
[SPEAKER_15]: Miracle grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was crawling around trying to throw race
cars underneath the door here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus, you do have an older child though,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, my older child lately has
jumped into the wonderful world of
[SPEAKER_03]: building his own gaming PC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've spent the last few days buying
components off of Amazon so he can build
[SPEAKER_03]: this PC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of excited for him to enter
that world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not a world I ever entered,
but it's definitely a cool world that
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe could lead him into coding or some
other kind of interesting things in
[SPEAKER_03]: regards to playing with computers.
[SPEAKER_15]: At least he has the interest and has
something he wants to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to, I remember those little,
uh, kits, the radio kits and stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to get it radio shack and I used to
love putting together the transistors and
[SPEAKER_15]: then the FM.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you have the 60 different
components ones.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, I wish I would have had access
to computer components so that I could
[SPEAKER_15]: actually build a computer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you can just go, I need this,
I need this, I need this, I need this and
[SPEAKER_15]: I need the box.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, it's incredible what they can
do.
[SPEAKER_15]: So is he into Minecraft or anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is he just into Minecraft when he was
quite a bit younger, like maybe around 11,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's 14 now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's into like, uh, you know,
just like any type of violent game that he
[SPEAKER_03]: can like hunt and kill zombies or like
creatures or, you know, he's a 14 year old
[SPEAKER_03]: boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm pretty sure all of you guys
were 14 year old boys at one point in
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, yeah, the most wholesome
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The key thing is boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He really is the quintessential.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's, uh, great for supporting it and,
you know, encouraging that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I support whatever my kids are into,
you know, it's, uh, when he came to me and
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to learn to play piano when he was
like 11 years old and he was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I want to learn piano.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of got him this little toy piano,
but he's like, can I take lessons?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, I want to learn how to
read music.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, okay, now he just reads music.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lately and Sam will here today,
all the songs in my house are all the
[SPEAKER_03]: songs from Rick and Morty that he's
printed off the computer and learned on
[SPEAKER_03]: his computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let me tell you, these are real songs.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are not simple, like chopstick type
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, I can't even understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Understand this music at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at it and it looks like another
language.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm always stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's getting schwifty.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is getting schwifty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you the mind develops in ways
that is just completely, it's a nonlinear
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like chess players.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're thinking about what's next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's playing music fast and turning the
page.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look on the bright side.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could read and write music when I was a
child.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Sam's style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas I learned myself, I learned how to
read music in chorus, but I could hear it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so where's my brother, my father had
perfect pitch.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was always fascinated by music,
not as well as in math, but I've always
[SPEAKER_15]: fascinated by music.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I picked up a, I remember a steel
string guitar and my brother had,
[SPEAKER_15]: my brother's blind.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so he played piano exceptionally well.
[SPEAKER_15]: So my aunt and uncle thought that if they
got him a guitar, he would be able to do
[SPEAKER_15]: that.
[SPEAKER_15]: However, the guitar is a steel string
Sears robot piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as I know Dr. Scaldone will definitely
attest, pressing your fingers on those is
[SPEAKER_15]: a beast.
[SPEAKER_15]: And for a blind person who reads Braille,
et cetera, et cetera, it was just too hard
[SPEAKER_15]: for him.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was very fortunate to have a guitar
around to pick up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, I don't, you know, besides
chorus, I don't know where else I would
[SPEAKER_15]: have been able to go with that,
but I was able to find bass and other
[SPEAKER_15]: things.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I really, really a big, huge supporter
of music and youth.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, it really opens the mind
and the experience exponentially.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause you learn to listen to parts of
music.
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't just listen to a song.
[SPEAKER_15]: You learn to, like as a bass player,
I learned to pick out parts of songs and
[SPEAKER_15]: parts of things so that I had to study
that and understand that follow the
[SPEAKER_15]: drummer and, you know, not think as a
guitar leader, you know, anything like
[SPEAKER_15]: that had to think in a completely
different mindset.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it also gives you different
understandings of your place in the music
[SPEAKER_15]: as well, which I know Dr. Sheldon will,
you know, to, you know, that's what makes
[SPEAKER_15]: a band, you know, everybody has a piece
and a part to it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when you understand that, I mean,
it's, it's a great understanding of
[SPEAKER_15]: concept and idea, and it opens the mind to
so many other experiences and ability to
[SPEAKER_15]: communicate with other people.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, your kid could be in a band or
something like that, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: saying?
[SPEAKER_15]: And understand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who, who wouldn't rather have their 14
year old kid getting schwifty over
[SPEAKER_03]: squanching all day?
[SPEAKER_15]: Word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, the Rick and Morty's, the Rick and
Morty's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam and Mark are probably like,
what is this strange language these two
[SPEAKER_03]: speak?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got to get caught up on your Rick
and Morty or you will not be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: communicate with 11 to 14 year old boys at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you'll miss out on all the Szechuan
sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is true as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got Cuban Chronic trying to get into
the room right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is, he was going to take us through his
drying room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess he's like a lot of people in
Oregon right now, which is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: or, and Washington for that matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got so cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people's, I saw Benson Elvis,
his field was frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like fully fresh frozen on the
field the other day, like big beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, just like frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty, uh, that's got to be nerve
wracking.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's yeah, his face says it all right
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nothing good about freezing your plants
outside due to weather.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's bad enough on your regular
plants or any annuals or anything like
[SPEAKER_15]: that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, I've been very fortunate, never have
to have that issue or problem,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I'm shout out to those that are,
I know that's frustrating as hell.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, cause the, and before his plants
froze, before his plants froze,
[SPEAKER_11]: did he say that his area and so Northern
Oregon or wherever he was at was the most
[SPEAKER_11]: beautiful place to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right before his plants froze,
he said that you are such a bastard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mark, where's my son Jake?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Hey, welcome Jake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Jake.
Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_16]: Young Sheldon.
[SPEAKER_16]: Does your dad make you play an acoustic
guitar too?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been playing for a while.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just picked it up cause it was just
around.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: He plays drums and he plays bass and
upright bass too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He played upright bass in the orchestra in
his school orchestra, but then you could
[SPEAKER_01]: play regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I play electric bass too, but I play a lot
of drums.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're right in the rhythm section there.
[SPEAKER_15]: So now you just sat, sit in the pocket.
[SPEAKER_15]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a bass player myself, so I love the
double bass.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I grew up in New Orleans with jazz
and everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: So kudos on that.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not an easy instrument to,
to, to pick up.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's not an easy instrument to bring
around.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the pain in the ass to bring,
bring from place to place, but it's a,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's a, it's rewarding once you learn how
to play an instrument like that for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm always staring.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the hash scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about the hash scene?
[SPEAKER_13]: What, what about it?
[SPEAKER_13]: What about it?
[SPEAKER_13]: What about it?
[SPEAKER_13]: It needs to come out to Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's basically the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some, some are more progressive than
others, obviously, but no, we've been in
[SPEAKER_11]: Pennsylvania for years.
[SPEAKER_11]: All you have to do is shake the trees.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a clear need.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a clear need in one for it here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I can tell you the market,
the market exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's coming right there that we're,
we're catering to because they're the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that got the money and it needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our money, but they got it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a Commonwealth, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a Commonwealth, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a Commonwealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but Pennsylvania, I feel like has,
has a long way to go just as a state.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a rich history, you know,
in William Pence, Pennsylvania,
[SPEAKER_01]: you were taxed if you did not grow ham
because what did her majesty need?
[SPEAKER_01]: She needed ropes and sails and oil and all
kinds of shit that you get from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not too far from our front door here
was the, was the cradle of the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: industry during the 13 colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this was run by William Penn,
we actually live in Penn township,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the township that was allocated
to the Penn family, Penn P E N N.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, he was a big advocate for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: They find here is they have the millstones
or conical that they used to grind hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: with, because I guess if you use flat
millstones, there's too much surface area
[SPEAKER_01]: contact and you don't get good,
you know, draining of the, of the oil or
[SPEAKER_01]: the flour or whatever they're grinding
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the conical millstones that they find
in the old farms around here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennsylvania were used for hemp grinding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conical millstones, who would have
thought, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be cool how, well, I guess it would
have never gone away had they not had it
[SPEAKER_03]: not been for prohibition, but also,
you know, the history of all of that stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: was so buried as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's not as easy to find.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's literally towns around here named
after the hemp production.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a school district, West Hemfield
up by where Millersville is, Millersville
[SPEAKER_13]: University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a book written by a friend of
mine called Less Start called Hempstone
[SPEAKER_01]: Heritage Mark that actually less,
I've been trying to get less on Hash
[SPEAKER_01]: Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully one day we can get them on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a, he's an advocate Harrisburg and
he's written this book about, about the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp industry in Pennsylvania,
mostly just by researching old newspaper
[SPEAKER_01]: articles and whatnot, and just going to
old libraries and digging up stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was a whole big industry for a
real, real long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Up until the 30s.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was still operating until the early
1950s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, it sucks that that doesn't
exist anymore, but it should come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our governor actually supports it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have a hemp thing that passed with
a very large majority on both sides of the
[SPEAKER_01]: aisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of interest in it,
but they only let these people grow very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very small acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were only able to grow somewhere
between three and five acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we discussed on a previous
episode, one of those was just at an old
[SPEAKER_01]: anthracite coal mine where they were just
using the hemp field just as a fight over
[SPEAKER_01]: mediation process, because there was just
basically a barren wasteland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things of this old mining industry that
used to mine coal and coal is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of toxic shit in coal,
but, and, and, you know, they didn't throw
[SPEAKER_01]: any top soil or they didn't till it at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just threw a bunch of seeds down on
this old hemp sands with your old
[SPEAKER_01]: processed tillings from the ore and from
the mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wouldn't you know it, that a whole
bunch of plants still grew anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would think that, you know,
if you just throw seeds out on this,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like it's in a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff's not going to grow,
but certainly a whole, and in areas there
[SPEAKER_01]: were clusters of plants that grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to do some kind of
study to see does that sort of remediate
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil in a way that they can reclaim it
for agricultural or other uses,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now, I don't know that it's
a toxic waste site, but I don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like dead land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's whole, there's whole sides of
mountains in central Pennsylvania where
[SPEAKER_13]: you can go and it's barren.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no trees.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they just, from mine tailings,
they do what they call mountain topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they practice that anymore
in Pennsylvania, but they still do 18 in
[SPEAKER_01]: West Virginia where basically they just
obliterate the top of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, they don't weigh the entire mountain
starting from the top down.
[SPEAKER_15]: They just plant it all the way down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to, they need to let Paul
Stamence inoculate that mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you hear this asshole in the White
House talk about go coal and coal
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, I mean, we all need clean air to
breathe and clean water to drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that coal industry is never going to
be where it could be done safely such that
[SPEAKER_01]: it provides, you know, energy that is safe
because all the people who live around
[SPEAKER_01]: those areas are poisoned with toxic runoff
and the mountains just look horrible and
[SPEAKER_01]: they end up planning, you know,
all kinds of green fields up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like meadows and everything,
but it used to be old growth forest.
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful old growth cedars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just, you can just tell it looks
like the earth's been scarred and it looks
[SPEAKER_05]: very scarred.
[SPEAKER_01]: A haphazardly way, almost like a
checkerboard kind of thing where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see that certain plots of land were like
clear cut it and just, I have faith in
[SPEAKER_03]: humans in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I listened to this, I think Paul
Stamence, I think let him go inoculate
[SPEAKER_03]: those mountains like he did with that
pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inoculate the people first, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the people who are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to inoculate them with knowledge
and a lot of good hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they're just starting to get it
now that their tap water is catching on
[SPEAKER_13]: fire.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're fracking those areas so bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, literally people are taking
showers, lighting candles and their
[SPEAKER_13]: bathrooms are blowing up.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Free hot water.
[SPEAKER_16]: But the thing is, is that they're removing
topsoil along with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're left with just rocky tops.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't see any hamper, any grass
really growing there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, they've got everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question for the group.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Wade.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here in Nevada County, we had gold mining
back in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_08]: 1800s.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's square miles of Nevada County
that still look like a moonscape.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, they did hydraulic mining and
washed away all the soil to uncover gravel
[SPEAKER_08]: beds that had gold in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And meantime in extracting gold,
they left behind mercury.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are mines in the area, old mines
that water runs out of them that has
[SPEAKER_08]: arsenic and mercury.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all of these things going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the question is, and I don't know
if Mark might be the one or Sam that would
[SPEAKER_08]: have an answer to this, but because
cannabis is a bioaccumulator, one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: concerns I have is that it picks up these
heavy metals as well as pesticides and
[SPEAKER_08]: fungicides that we've discussed at length.
[SPEAKER_08]: But to what extent does cannabis
concentrate things like mercury or arsenic
[SPEAKER_08]: or whatnot?
[SPEAKER_08]: And what do we do about using plants like
that for medicine?
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know exactly which heavy
metals it picks up in the highest
[SPEAKER_11]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you wouldn't have to worry about
gold or silver, but unfortunately most of
[SPEAKER_11]: that's gone.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what's left is the real toxic shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's been one of the big debates
regarding industrial hemp for reclamation
[SPEAKER_15]: projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: Going back to 1996, done at an old iron
mill in Poland.
[SPEAKER_15]: But they're even starting to reclaim areas
in Japan using hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: The discussion is, well, what do you do
with this hemp now?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's toxic.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is now, that would have, I mean,
Fujishima and stuff would have full on,
[SPEAKER_15]: Fukushima would have full on radioactivity
isotopes inside the plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: We know that the plant can actually uptake
those.
[SPEAKER_15]: So then I've had this discussion many
times.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you do with these plants?
[SPEAKER_15]: You strip them of fiber because the fiber
would possibly have radioactivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Theoretically, once it's been sequestered
in the plant and they've done this with
[SPEAKER_01]: things like malt and barley as well,
because as you know, anyone who's cooked
[SPEAKER_01]: from barley knows that barley absorbs many
times its weight in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So barley has been used in sequestration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have it sequestered, now you can
take that in a controlled facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: do an incineration of that and capture the
toxic metal in the ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, so concentrated can the toxic
metal be in the ash that they actually
[SPEAKER_01]: refine that to get the metal out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it actually is a cashflow positive
situation if you're trying to remove toxic
[SPEAKER_01]: shit like lead, tin, mercury, because all
those shit have some industrial commodity
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fito remediation in general, you're
absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what Wade's concern is,
is that if you're cultivating cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: human consumption and you're in these
zones where there's been mining activity
[SPEAKER_01]: that has completely destroyed the natural
landscape, Wade was saying they're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: arsenic and other things that have been
unearthed that would normally not be an
[SPEAKER_01]: issue if they had not done the mining
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mining activity usually leaves a
trail of toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's superfund sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at those superfund sites,
eight out of 10 of them are mining sites
[SPEAKER_01]: where they basically just mined stuff
until it got so toxic and then they just
[SPEAKER_01]: closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer economical and then created
a superfund site to be cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is, is that if you're
growing cannabis and your cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed, to those things, absolutely there
could be some trace level of some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: toxic, if you're using water that's not
treated and you're not making sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not those types of metals in your
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And arsenic is actually funny because it's
actually not a metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually what they call a,
it's a semi-metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost a non-metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not arsenic itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not arsenic metal, but it's arsenate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And arsenate, which was in chromated
copper arsenate, which was the treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: for pressure treated lumber for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know those green telephone poles and
the jungle gyms and the picnic tables and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That green stuff was chromated copper
arsenate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as lot as that wood goes out into
eventually landfills and out of service,
[SPEAKER_01]: that arsenic leaches into groundwater and
that arsenic can, if you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: groundwater to water your cannabis plants,
could essentially create a background
[SPEAKER_01]: level of arsenic in your water,
in grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, these are things that you have to
test your water for and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately you test your flower and your
concentrates to make sure that,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, I think the point that I think Wade
was bringing up, which is that some,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cannabis production is in and
around areas where mining industry has
[SPEAKER_01]: left an incredible, unbelievable bad
impact on the local ground and the local
[SPEAKER_01]: groundwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the populations of people because I
don't know if it's correlated to Matthews,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's a lot of Matthews in West
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's anything to do
with the mining industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of joblessness.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of homelessness that goes
deeper than Matthews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean West Virginia, we've been to
West Virginia a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of industry here because of
these people's reliance on an industry
[SPEAKER_13]: that is dying.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't know how to adapt and how to
grow and how to move into a new industry
[SPEAKER_13]: like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And coal is not the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time he gets up there and he's
like, oh, coal, coal, coal, him and Scott
[SPEAKER_01]: Pruitt should go fuck themselves because
we're not going backwards and making
[SPEAKER_01]: energy by coal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, not to interrupt you guys talking
about politics and all, but how about we
[SPEAKER_03]: welcome D420K into the room?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade Laughter into the room and someone
who's never been on Hash Church before,
[SPEAKER_03]: a new panelist, Cuban Chronic in the
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time I saw you, you were surrounded
by huge plants last time I saw you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm surrounded by a dab right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well you do your dab and we'll
see what you have to show us in a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we need to get the conversation back
on track away from anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you talk about politics, we'll get
emotional.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about coal though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about coal and we were
talking about how the mining industry has
[SPEAKER_01]: an impact on growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, what's your shirt?
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to carry on that conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is your shirt?
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought it at a D420 rally a couple years
ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a woman empowering fucking shirt or
whatever and I wore it quite a bit and I'm
[SPEAKER_14]: walking down the street and I get a lot
of, I get attention from every shape and
[SPEAKER_14]: size and age of human being that's walking
toward when they see the shirt.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody looks and I'm cruising around
the street thinking, fuck, I think I look
[SPEAKER_14]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Today I must have my beard combed up nice
and my hair slicked back and then I see
[SPEAKER_14]: the shirt and it's, I remember wearing the
shirt and it's fucking hilarious because
[SPEAKER_14]: everybody, old, young, they're just like,
want their buddy or their partner.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pussy free.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is actually, and it was quite a funny
story to be told while Cuban product was
[SPEAKER_03]: showing his plants hanging.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's quite the fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for real, dude, what are we looking
at here, Cuban?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what variety?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man, we got a lot of variety in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But first I want to give my respect to all
the panelists, everybody on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really look forward to watching it every
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well you've been hanging out in the
chat room for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man, I've become an addict of it,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are, definitely some of the best
I know of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right here, this is actually an 818
headband and it is very fuely.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I see.
[SPEAKER_16]: Need that 4K.
[SPEAKER_16]: How many grams do you think you're getting
up a plant of that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: We usually range somewhere from three to
five a plant, but sometimes we hit like
[SPEAKER_07]: seven or eight pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you prefer to dry with all the leaves
still intact?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we just hang dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like this, man, just like tobacco kind
of.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I used to kind of think that I agree
with that because I felt the plant was
[SPEAKER_11]: going to lose 90% of its weight water.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you need to do it through the leaves,
or if the leaves are all gone,
[SPEAKER_11]: it'll do it through the flowers.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for some reason I felt it was better
to do intact leaves.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know that for a scientific
fact.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just what I felt in my gut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt it in your gut, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd probably take your gut over some
scientific facts.
[SPEAKER_11]: My gut's big enough that there's enough
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a trimmer before I was a grower,
and I definitely prefer the hang dried
[SPEAKER_07]: plants as far as smoke and just trimming
it in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: You trim over screens?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, before I had screens, I was pretty
much trim it while it's wet sort of thing
[SPEAKER_15]: just to...
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_15]: But now I see.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all on different gardeners,
it seems.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some are in favor of cutting it while it's
wet.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some are in favor of cutting it while it's
dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were kind of forced to harvest out
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got some frost a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we left a few out, but we covered them
up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you guys could see that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Frost is definitely unkind to these
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be cutting those branches right into
my bags.
[SPEAKER_11]: Varieties where really cold temperatures
speeded up and made it get frostier.
[SPEAKER_11]: But almost all varieties don't like it
when it comes to... You can just see how
[SPEAKER_07]: empty the garden is now.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what happens, Sam?
[SPEAKER_15]: So ice crystals just form inside the water
crystals?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if that happens, it absolutely fucks
up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some varieties are very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Other varieties are fairly resistant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe the resistance comes from genetic
history and others.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a lot of cold where their parents
are coming from?
[SPEAKER_15]: So things with Afghanistan kind of
influences would tend to have,
[SPEAKER_15]: you would think, have that type of
biodefense?
[SPEAKER_15]: Things from the upper mountains?
[SPEAKER_11]: But the bottom line is take your clone and
leave one outside, because you might be
[SPEAKER_11]: cold.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the way you learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is some lavender from Soma.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Left it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice and purple.
[SPEAKER_16]: Those could tell it was true.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_16]: I said, when did those go on the ground?
[SPEAKER_16]: Cuban?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: When did those go on the ground?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a bit of a late start this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: We usually get in early April,
but we were instead in like early May,
[SPEAKER_07]: if not mid May out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in Eastern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fairly dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: We usually get a longer season than this,
but it got too cold too quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it rained right before it got
cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got a little scared.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of people were getting scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was either fires burning their plants
down to the ground or freezing weather
[SPEAKER_03]: coming in and freezing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see Benson Elvis's garden?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really am feeling for sub cool though.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel real bad for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know so many people, so many people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, quite a few lives lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was over 7,000 structures that
burned to the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a neighborhood in Santa Rosa
where houses would burn on one side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: street down to the ground and on the other
side, no damage at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was either you're gone or you
didn't get touched.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's almost some like, what's that
all about?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's terrifying.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you do if your outdoor material
does succumb to frost or a snowfall?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that completely, I mean, you just,
you whack it down, but what, does that
[SPEAKER_01]: take away from potency or what does it do?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really not sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are the scientists, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about frozen?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm talking about like if you're right
just before harvest and you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get one more day of growth and you just
try to get those things out, but you do
[SPEAKER_01]: that one day and your stuff either
succumbs to frost or a snowfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it really deleteriously affect the
quality of the material?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not the resin so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: My worry would be that it would
potentially like that the resin could
[SPEAKER_03]: burn.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll change the color.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll change the smell a bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll change the taste a bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And most people don't find those changes
favorable.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you let the plants really freeze
hard, it turns it into black goop soup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've not had much experience with
hard freezes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at 30,000 feet more or less.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have had a couple of harvests that
got abundant rain on them before harvest
[SPEAKER_08]: was done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they didn't seem to mind it much at
all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put a lot of effort into supporting the
weight of the branches before they fill
[SPEAKER_08]: in.
[SPEAKER_11]: So isn't it amazing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get a higher incidence of mold
that year, Wade?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I've got a pretty good drying setup.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had good sun right after that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, for example, in October,
California started getting rain.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had over 100 inches of rain here after
four years of drought.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in October, in about two days,
we got 10 inches of rain all at once.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we still had probably half the garden
was still out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we lost a couple of branches.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the most part, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: The sun came back a couple of days after
the rain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it came on slowly.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some cloud cover and a nice breeze.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the plants perked right up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had a nice finish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Had to use a dehumidifier in the drying
room because the ambient humidity here
[SPEAKER_08]: with all the rain that followed after that
first storm, yeah, there was no way they
[SPEAKER_08]: would have dried with ambient air.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to use dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the plants themselves seemed to do
fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't see much mold.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the cultivars that seem to be high in
CBD, at least in my experience,
[SPEAKER_08]: are for the most part not very susceptible
to mold.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something Sam has talked about
before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know the specifics of that or
the why of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it seems to be my experience that
they're not real susceptible to mold.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll say it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty amazing that you think that
you can make really tasty material from
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh, frozen, freshly harvested material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet if the plant is alive and is frozen,
there must be some inherent biochemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: that happens within the plant to make it
either susceptible to mold or,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Sam was saying, make the color
change, make it different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of what would go on is in a hard
freeze, all the water in that plant would
[SPEAKER_08]: expand and burst the cell walls of every
bit of the plant material.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why you'd end up with that mush
Sam was talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be a big soup of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I had that experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh, frozen material, that's happening
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take the plant and you harvest
it and the plant still has a decent amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of water in it, frozen process,
you're still doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I was kind of thinking about
this in terms of if a grower came out and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden saw his grows succumb to
frost, it's like cut everything down and
[SPEAKER_01]: then just keep it frozen and make live
resin out of it because you've already
[SPEAKER_01]: started that process of burst all the cell
walls because we freeze everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: What you say makes sense to me,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just saying exactly what you're
saying makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, Sam, maybe there's some
sort of plant defense biochemical
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism that if it gets close to
freezing, the plant is stressed and
[SPEAKER_01]: creates some kind of plume of whatever in
the plant to give it this different
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor, different color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely happens with animals,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on how you kill an animal,
its flesh will taste very different.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was telling somebody that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, don't cut it while it's in
shock.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll taste bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you release adrenaline and you
let the animal know that it's dying before
[SPEAKER_03]: it's dying.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, what you do is you talk to each plant
and say, it's OK, baby.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to really have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you whack them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, what I tell mine when I'm
taking them down is that they're now going
[SPEAKER_08]: through the next step of the process to be
in service to all the humans that are
[SPEAKER_08]: waiting for this medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do think they're sentient beings,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know, Sam, you don't hold a lot of
cotton to that, but I feel like every one
[SPEAKER_08]: of them is different.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they really respond.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to take them individually when I
would harvest them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would take them into another room so the
other plants wouldn't see.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've always kind of felt, once I saw that
plants do have some understanding and they
[SPEAKER_15]: can see things around them and respond.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've kind of always felt that way.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know people think I'm crazy,
but you know, it's just one of those
[SPEAKER_15]: things I've kind of always felt about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: As a plant breeder, through selection,
I can honestly say I've killed way more
[SPEAKER_11]: many plants than I've ever fully grown and
harvested.
Murderer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Improvement is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, you don't learn until you kill your
first 100.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just wanted to jump in for a
minute and say, I'm really glad Mark
[SPEAKER_02]: brought up the point about harvesting a
frozen plant quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's a window between when it
froze and maybe before it thaws out,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've been processing a lot of live
resin, so we're freezing what we get
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately after a harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it stays frozen until it's
extracted.
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to get a little bit closer to the
mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, apologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the same question as Mark Skeldone
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to thank you for wondering if we
could just harvest those plants before
[SPEAKER_02]: they thawed out, you know, and process
them as live resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Either you harvest them before they
freeze, or if you freeze them,
[SPEAKER_11]: let them stay frozen and process them
while they're frozen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that is part of the solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of people out there doing fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few people doing field frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forced field frozen, Hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Field frozen, bitches.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cubans just keeps going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's his picture now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still getting a tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're still waiting for Keegan to
come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, then we should have a bong rip,
right there, D?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, motherlovers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's have a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_14]: I woke up yesterday to a blizzard in my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't snow.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was just fucking sad.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's gone now.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just not sunny.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was in Yellowstone.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was snowing practically until the last
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you look at my pictures, you'll see
there's snow on the trees and on the
[SPEAKER_15]: ground, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the snow, personally.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, dry sifting time now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it really wasn't sticking too much
on the ground.
[SPEAKER_15]: It just made a little slick on the roads,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I went to college in West
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I learned how to drive in the snow.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it wasn't so bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, yeah, unfortunately,
my mom ran herself off the road in a
[SPEAKER_15]: Subaru and had to get pulled out on my way
to see her.
[SPEAKER_15]: Literally, first thing we go to the rental
place to meet her.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we get a call from her,
ran off the road.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: So she just went just a couple of feet
just into the snow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just off the road.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they were able to, AAA was able to
come out.
[SPEAKER_15]: She was in the Grand Teton.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they were able to come in.
[SPEAKER_15]: She was just like a quarter mile past and
pull her out.
[SPEAKER_15]: It just took a little time.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was snowing the whole time.
[SPEAKER_15]: So and my mom, I've never known her to
drive in snow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember, she's from Louisiana,
lives in Texas.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I had no idea necessarily how to give
spacing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, it just happens.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, she was fine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything was good.
[SPEAKER_15]: But remember, people, when you're driving
in the snow, give people a couple of car
[SPEAKER_15]: length space in between.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that snow is slick when you hit your
brakes.
[SPEAKER_15]: My Canadian friends can agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me a lot of fun in the snow if you're
applying it properly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Parking lots empty with full snow falls in
them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking great.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, go and paint.
[SPEAKER_16]: Go and doughnuts.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: The back of the bumpers and toboggans on
the end of those 30 feet and just do laps
[SPEAKER_14]: and doughnuts until they fell off,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: We did that in Louisiana with three
wheelers and mud.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd get like a four by eight and get a
ski rope and then just get pulled behind.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Entertainment you need to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: Car hood.
[SPEAKER_14]: Works good behind a vehicle in the snow
too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get a few people on there too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Turn it right upside down there and get
the slick side.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold some handles on it even.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right on the front so you can just give
her.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had some fun up here in the younger
days of the snow falls.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still take my truck off road with my
sled in the back, drive up the mountain,
[SPEAKER_03]: up a shady wintery road into the back
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then get the sled off and then go as
far in as you can go before you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to run out of gas on the way back.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can literally just keep on going.
[SPEAKER_14]: A mark for through those mountains in the
back of your place there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could tell you ran out of gas and you
were, you know, get a helicopter drop for
[SPEAKER_14]: fuel and keep on going.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had a helicopter, I think I'd just be
in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just leave the sled.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need the snow.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you'd leave the sled.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: You love your sled.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we could hang it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fly with the sled hanging underneath so
they can drop the sled first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the people, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your sled.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be nice to have the sled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had not heard of heli sledding before.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of these guys are on when they drop
them.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey Cuban, what are you going to do with
those plants you got there?
[SPEAKER_03]: You hashing them?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's muted.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's muted.
[SPEAKER_14]: I suppose he's.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: What up?
[SPEAKER_14]: Love seeing those plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you back?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely, I use hash for my own use,
but we take care of each.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every six plants represents a patient in
here and we basically just provide them
[SPEAKER_07]: the medicine they need for the year,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And whatever form they need.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do the best I can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to explain this to you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in this County and you know,
Oregon's legal, everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in this County that's as far East
as possible and they're close to a
[SPEAKER_07]: Republican state.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they opted out of the legalization and
all the money from the state and things
[SPEAKER_07]: like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically all we can do in this County
is we are allowed to grow our medical out
[SPEAKER_07]: of city limits.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can have a, you know, more than 12
plants if we live out of city limits.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of a conundrum over here for
people that need the stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's not any outlet.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like six plants is one patient and you
said you can get five pounds off a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 pounds per patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good, that's a good annual
amount.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do pretty well.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just, they allowed us to,
they took us medical guys out of the
[SPEAKER_07]: equation pretty much with all the rec
growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's through the liquor
commission, but now they're allowing us
[SPEAKER_07]: small growers or, you know, small handed
medical guys to get rid of a little bit of
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff on the legal market.
[SPEAKER_07]: To at least cover our costs and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, at least they gave us a
chance.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a way better situation than
Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pretty much killed off medical and
there's no crossing under happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go back like 15 years and nobody had
nothing.
Nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we did it anyway, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much nicer to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to admit like for your family and
for your loved ones, like it's so much
[SPEAKER_03]: nicer to be able to grow cannabis and help
people without the worry of having your
[SPEAKER_03]: door kicked down, your livelihood taken,
your life stolen and jailed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really should sort of give props more
often as we're constantly criticizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course it's not perfect, but holy shit,
we've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shout out to all the activists and
organizers who made it happen,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, that pulled together the
resources and got people involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you to everybody who's
contributed and put your signature down
[SPEAKER_15]: there and then went out and voted,
you know, because it's a series of events
[SPEAKER_15]: that made these things happen.
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't just one thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it was very helpful that,
you know, California lost.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then, you know, Washington and Colorado
were like, well, fuck them.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Oregon, oh, fuck it, we can do it
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to give a shout out to those
people because the government doesn't give
[SPEAKER_03]: anything you have to take from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So give thanks to all the cannabis takers
that took from the government and got us
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of to where we are today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I give many thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day I have a career thanks to the
law change that happened in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm happy to be a part of the I-502
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's perfect, but we keep moving
forwards and that's how we got to where we
[SPEAKER_02]: are today.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you started off with the forms
that we want as the survey that they want
[SPEAKER_14]: to fill out in BC, Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you seen any of that, the form that
they want of our opinion on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I filled that out a long time ago,
a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: Remind people, you know, maybe put the
link up or something, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's, it might be over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might not be, but it's on.
[SPEAKER_03]: November 1st is when it ends.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got over 20,000 from BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew that much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it basically is, how do you want the
situation to go?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, which is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a couple of those now for the ACNPR
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had one of those.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what is currently happening there in
Canada?
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I hear of different cities are
doing different things, either allowing or
[SPEAKER_15]: not allowing or.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, federally there's going to be
federal law, which right now we have a
[SPEAKER_03]: federal cannabis medical system in place
called the ACNPR.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ACNPR is both for patients and for
companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can get an ACNPR license and I can
grow and use my own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: These companies can get a special ACNPR.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called an LP license, and then they
can grow and distribute cannabis to
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's, that's the, that's the
thing that's in place right now for
[SPEAKER_03]: medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's constantly like, Oh, we need to
get concentrates a bigger part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they only allow us a very diluted
oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't allow edibles in the legal,
in the, in the business aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have an ACNPR yourself,
you can use all forms of extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do anything that you want with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only these companies that are limited
to being able to sell these products,
[SPEAKER_03]: which obviously puts a huge hindrance on,
on the business of, of, of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't sell like 90% of what the
products are, then it creates the black
[SPEAKER_03]: market or what I call the civil
disobedience market, which is the market
[SPEAKER_03]: that got us into the place that we are
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you always got to give props to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dispensaries, Hillary starting the
compassion club and all these others that
[SPEAKER_03]: followed our civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's they're there because the LPs
aren't legally allowed to sell all of
[SPEAKER_03]: these great products, edibles and shatters
and bubbles and all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it causes, it causes dispensaries
to have to exist for patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise patients don't have access to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's recreational, which is
supposed to be in by July of 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is mostly what you're talking
about right now with provinces,
[SPEAKER_03]: because the federal cannabis is the same
in every province.
[SPEAKER_03]: The provinces can figure out how they want
to distribute it eventually, but right now
[SPEAKER_03]: it's MMAR or ACNPR is all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And MMAR is the one that preceded the
ACNPR.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was prior.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a part of the MMAR.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the one that we did the lawsuit
and we went against our government and
[SPEAKER_03]: said, no, like this is all breaking the
charter of rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have it be like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we won thanks to Craig Dussault and
John Conroy and Jason Wilcox and Johnny B
[SPEAKER_03]: and Ramo and all these people that were a
big part of the coalition.
[SPEAKER_03]: They made it so we could continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with, with recreation coming in,
it's the four plant thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each province is going to figure out how
they want to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ontario came out and said they wanted to
open 150 stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something over the course of the
next five years and everyone lost their
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter how it happens, everyone's going
to continue to lose their shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine them ever doing it the way
we actually want, but I do see it going
[SPEAKER_03]: slowly, but surely like us just chiseling
away at the parts we don't want until it
[SPEAKER_03]: gets to be, you know, something that's,
that's, that we can stand behind.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you're doing with these surveys that
you and Dee are talking about are those
[SPEAKER_15]: sent out to you by the government or these
sent out by regions?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go online and fill them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're on the health Canada website.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the link, but if Dee knows
it, he can put it up in the hash church
[SPEAKER_03]: group in Facebook.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you've presented, cause it sounds
like you've helped it's shaped not
[SPEAKER_15]: perfectly, but you've, you'll have been
able to, you know, manipulate the shaping
[SPEAKER_15]: of how things are to an extent,
not fully, but to an extent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least everyone can have their
voice and it's in every province.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be like, uh,
I'm sure it'll be like a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_03]: plus, or maybe 200,000 people might,
uh, end up offering good opinions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully they have the people that can
go through and listen to those opinions
[SPEAKER_03]: and actually, uh, you know, you'd hope
that they would use some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: opinions, particularly ones that reoccur
over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you have legal mail order cannabis,
correct?
[SPEAKER_15]: Such as.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only cannabis and a very
diluted kind of olive oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: And how long does it take that such as if
I place an order for that, how long would
[SPEAKER_15]: that take?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have it the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend was tripping on it when it first
happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, dude, he was ordering from
Tilray and he was like, and he was in
[SPEAKER_03]: Toronto.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, dude, you know how crazy this
is at like three o'clock in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can order herb and I get it before like
noon the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm in Toronto like three hours ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like, that's pretty crazy for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mail order.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, welcome forest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, good morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, how are you doing buddy?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're deep in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got evacuated, but you got let back.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So apologize.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm behind.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was up late last night and just
getting going this morning, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's been, it's been crazy here,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, we talked a little bit
about it and we're hopefully going to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, give out the right links for
people where they can, uh, donate their
[SPEAKER_03]: time or clothes or money or whatever it is
they have that they want to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: share with a lot of these people that lost
everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I, I really, I was on sub cool asked
me to join them last night and I don't do
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of talking on there, but it's good
to just show some support after what
[SPEAKER_10]: they've been through.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that, um, they've got some
things set up with guys down there on the
[SPEAKER_10]: field, helping farmers, which is great.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can look up some of those links.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that California growers
association is doing the same thing as far
[SPEAKER_10]: as raising specifically for farmers and
helping them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can definitely provide some of
those links before we go today,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it's been, it's been crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were evacuated at four in the morning
on Monday and you know, you just kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: don't believe it when it happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, yeah, I'm sure we're fine,
you know, and yeah, it happens quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those winds, it was the winds,
you know, everyone's talking about the
[SPEAKER_10]: fire, but what really caused the emergency
was it was, there was a wind like I had
[SPEAKER_10]: never.
[SPEAKER_10]: Experienced like 50 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was insane.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wasn't just that the fire started,
you know, likely because of, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: drop down power lines, but then they
spread quick and we're moving fast.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it was, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I went out in my driveway and
looked down the road and there's the fire,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, it's, and it's coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: It ended our third, you know, I look back
on it and these things are minor.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to come home a few days later.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to keep our house.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it just felt really fortunate.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it was, it was a challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: It ended Silas's 38 day seizure free
streak, which kind of sucked the stress of
[SPEAKER_10]: the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: He started season just that afternoon,
which, you know, just medically fragile
[SPEAKER_10]: kids don't do well to adventure and
excitement and change.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, we come back and we look
back at the farmers that we know just in
[SPEAKER_10]: our area that lost their farms.
[SPEAKER_10]: And for me, it just really puts me on
another soapbox, which I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_10]: come in here and jump on and take over the
conversation, but it just, it's just
[SPEAKER_10]: another, there's an injustice there that's
not being talked about that really bothers
[SPEAKER_10]: me, which is these farmers are not allowed
to prepare for events like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they're not allowed to get the
right insurance.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not allowed to ensure the crops
that they're producing.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not allowed to bank.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of them have ridiculous amounts
of cash on hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when fires like this sweep through,
when you devastate those families,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, a lot of them, they lose the
cash they have on hand because there's no
[SPEAKER_10]: time to save anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: When the fire's coming at 50 or 60 miles
an hour, they lose their entire farm and
[SPEAKER_10]: they live in season to season.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it's just, it's hard to
watch these people's really lose
[SPEAKER_10]: everything be demonized throughout the
year.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know they're doing amazing work
because some of them are, they're amazing
[SPEAKER_10]: people who contribute to helping save kids
lives through our organization.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they have to lose everything and
no one really cares because they're just,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, pot growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just, you know, we have a lot of
growing up to do in this country and my
[SPEAKER_10]: heart breaks for all those families.
[SPEAKER_10]: So really, really glad someone's trying to
target those families specifically,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I think there's a lot more we need to
do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's not just that they lose this
year's crop.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that they're not allowed to prepare
in any way like a normal responsible adult
[SPEAKER_10]: would if they were treated with respect
and dignity.
[SPEAKER_10]: So my heart goes out to all those people
who are going through that right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will definitely be doing anything I
can to not only help them get through
[SPEAKER_10]: this, but like I like to do, show it to
the people in the people's faces,
[SPEAKER_10]: how they put them in this horrible
position for no real justice.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's defiable reason in its compounds,
the problem that makes it even worse.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it's, it's, it's a heartbreaker.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, not only that, how many people have
invested in the farms to get ready to play
[SPEAKER_15]: in the legal field?
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of people lost their reality to play
in the reality because as you said,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, it's either bank of the earth
or, you know, cause there are no banks.
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't go to banks.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been treated absolutely absurdly for
the good that we've done for generations
[SPEAKER_15]: now.
[SPEAKER_15]: And for people to be forced to suffer
through that is absolutely horrible to say
[SPEAKER_15]: the least.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, and I forgot to mention that
that's, that's why so many of them have
[SPEAKER_10]: nothing at this point, because they've
invested everything they've saved in the
[SPEAKER_10]: preparing for this legal market.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in Nevada County, where I spent a lot
of time, it's even worse.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, they've been strung
along for so many years now, the
[SPEAKER_10]: ordinances have changed.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they've invested thousands of dollars
in greenhouses that they are no longer
[SPEAKER_10]: really appropriate or not legal through
the ordinance.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they've just been strung along.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in all this money trying to do the
right thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it just, they lose everything in
a fire.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just, yeah, heart goes out to
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope everybody who.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to interrupt its raid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here in Nevada County, we've had three
different sets of laws about cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation in the last five years,
all with different specific requirements
[SPEAKER_08]: about if you want to have a garden,
it's got to be this or that and that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all kinds of people have put money
into trying to comply with the law.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, more than a few, like Boris just
said, lost everything that they put into
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just on a real selfish, personal note
here, I wanted to jump in before we
[SPEAKER_02]: shifted gears away from the topic of the
fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I parted ways with uptech,
I found work last fall down in Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: California as a trim again, harvester and
hasher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to work for a guy who's a
manager at Compassionate Heart there in
[SPEAKER_02]: Ukiah, Chad Emory, who had a 25 plant grow
at his property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he let me live there for two months
while I worked for him and made me part of
[SPEAKER_02]: his family.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loaned me his STI so I could take a
trip up to Humboldt and meet up with the
[SPEAKER_02]: dry sift Jedi and learn how to make dry
sift hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super generous guy, one of the most that
I've had the opportunity to work with in
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fire came in fast at his property
and he lost everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: His house burned to the ground,
his plot burned to the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: His STI that he lent me was roasted in his
driveway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's reached out for some help and
he's gotten it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to give a lot of thanks to the
soil king who seems to be linking up a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people in the area and has helped Chad
get into an apartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have donated him furniture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And clothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just wanted to say thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those helping down there and making a huge
difference to those who need it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I talked to the soil king was on the
show last night and what he's doing is
[SPEAKER_10]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_10]: So so hook up with him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those who can.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll see if I can look up the the links.
[SPEAKER_10]: But he said he's got enough clothes.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got rooms full of clothes.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, it's it's really to for the
people who are watching it's and from
[SPEAKER_10]: being someone who's needed help from time
to time due to circumstances outside of my
[SPEAKER_10]: control.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's always a rush in the first week.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And everyone says, hey, can I help?
[SPEAKER_10]: And sometimes so many people are asking
that at the time the people are in shock.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we got what we need or right now
we're OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: But really, if you really want to help,
it's remembering the ask in two weeks and
[SPEAKER_10]: again in four weeks and again in six weeks
and really try to combat this attention
[SPEAKER_10]: span issue.
[SPEAKER_10]: We seem to have in twenty seventeen where
we're just on to the next emergency or
[SPEAKER_10]: here in the states like Trump will pick
his butt on camera and everyone will talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about that for two months.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, we've got to just look out
for those distracting things and really
[SPEAKER_10]: remember to continue to check in with
these people, because when you lose
[SPEAKER_10]: everything like that, yeah, you might be
OK today because you're just you've got a
[SPEAKER_10]: pile of new clothes or donated clothes and
you have a nice chest that's full.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think, OK, I'm that I'm all right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm in shock.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really know what I could ask for,
but it's the long term follow through.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for anyone listening out there,
Marcus, if you'd want to, I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we really want to help again
because right now there's this flood and
[SPEAKER_10]: we need to continue helping.
[SPEAKER_10]: But in another six weeks, we could do a
lot of good by coming back and just saying
[SPEAKER_10]: we haven't forgotten and see what we could
do for those folks and raise the money or
[SPEAKER_10]: donations once they have time to breathe
and look around and say, OK, what could we
[SPEAKER_10]: really use, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a great idea, as always,
for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll support that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, hey, did you want to introduce your
friend that just got into the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want to welcome Keegan O'Neil to
Hash Church for the first episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Keegan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, guys, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: 502 processor in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I understand it, you've got quite a
family background in CO2 processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to learn from you today,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So can you guys hear me OK?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So about five years ago, my uncle had
gotten one of the first CO2 built by Apex
[SPEAKER_06]: and Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he started doing a lot of like
processing for edibles down in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had a big like natural medicine
background.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once I turned 21, he said,
come down, I'll give you some experience
[SPEAKER_06]: on my machine, because I really wanted to
grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, growing is my passion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been watching videos from Bubble Man
and John B.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really learned a lot from you guys
and basically just was all gung-ho about
[SPEAKER_06]: growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, well, I'll try to get you
in on like a grow or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you give me two years of your time,
we'll see what you think of that extra.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, OK, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So two years went by and I fell in love
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he ended up wanting to move back
down to California.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had moved up to Washington to do
processing in Washington.
And I didn't want to move back down to
California with him.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I moved back up to Bellingham and met
up with Cascadia Gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually met them for a growing position
because I figured no one up around here
[SPEAKER_06]: would have any kind of CO2 extractor or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it turns out they bring me in for an
interview and they're like, tell us about
[SPEAKER_06]: your experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, oh, I've been doing CO2
processing for the last two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were like, whoa, well,
we just bought this CO2 machine and we
[SPEAKER_06]: don't know how to run.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, whoa, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm your guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started doing a bunch of R&D on it
because I was really only allowed to make
[SPEAKER_06]: CO2 in the raw on my uncle's machine for
the edibles and for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I knew that there was a lot more that
could be done with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started messing around and I was able
to do complete fricking isolation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been able to do CO2 shatters,
crumbles, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's really cool, what I'm really
proud of are those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually just got those back,
the analytical results back from
[SPEAKER_06]: confidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And down here in Washington, they're an
analytical laboratory and they came back
[SPEAKER_06]: anywhere from I think 65 to 95% detectable
terpenes from I think around the 45 they
[SPEAKER_06]: can test for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they can test for up to 60 there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was pretty fun to see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're all below 0.7% THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you running incredibly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was super fricking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what temperature are you running at,
if you're allowed to say?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it is definitely colder than I would
have anticipated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's definitely around 70 degrees
Fahrenheit, I would say, is at least what
[SPEAKER_06]: the cooler output is reading.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the inside of the machine, I would
imagine, is around 65 to 70 degrees as
[SPEAKER_06]: well, the material column.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you grinding your material?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hang on, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my headphones hooked up to my phone
and the laptop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as soon as something goes off on the
phone, laptop cuts out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume you're grinding your material?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to grind material and completely
pulverize it, which is completely unlike
[SPEAKER_06]: what I would do for propane or butane hash
oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, allowing all of that
surface area to be present on the material
[SPEAKER_06]: allows the CO2 to do a better job
extracting all of the essential oils and
[SPEAKER_06]: also prevents the CO2 from channeling in
the column.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of times when that initial
burst of CO2 happens, if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_06]: proper pack or you don't have like a
uniform material size or particle size,
[SPEAKER_06]: I should say, you can get showing and then
that will really decrease your yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andres talked about that channeling in BHO
extraction and why he doesn't understand
[SPEAKER_03]: why so many people are using columns.
[SPEAKER_01]: He uses like a weird kind of- Well,
I think it's exacerbated under high
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure because everything's packed into
like a big pile.
That makes sense, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's going to find a path of least
resistance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, path of least resistance.
[SPEAKER_11]: And doesn't grinding the raw material
cause terpene loss just doing that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you're- So, I mean, as soon as
you cut the plant down, you're
[SPEAKER_06]: experiencing terpene loss, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I understand.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you started, you said you had no-
that you got all the terpenes or you had
[SPEAKER_11]: no terpene loss.
[SPEAKER_11]: I forget exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terpene extraction.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so are you getting all the terpenes
that are in a fresh plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm able to get from around a 10 pound
batch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm able to pull anywhere from 80 to 100
milliliters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you take recovered material and do like
an ethanol extraction and shoot it into GC
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure you've gotten all your
cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's actually one of the funnest
things I've just come out with on the
[SPEAKER_06]: market here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_06]: I call it high terpene, full spectrum,
absolute.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do a couple of processes in the CO2
machine where I remove all the lower
[SPEAKER_06]: molecular weight constituents of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I run the material in cold
critical ethanol making- and then I filter
[SPEAKER_06]: it with silica and a couple other medias.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I end up with around a 90 to 92%
overall cannabinoid extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or extract, I should say.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I re-add its native terpenes back
into it and around a percentage of seven
[SPEAKER_06]: to nine percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but it answered my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the CO2 extraction is not
grabbing everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, CO2 never does unless you're using PSI
of upwards of over 4,000, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what- And then that's a ton of fat as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What percentage of cannabinoids are you
removing?
[SPEAKER_01]: In your first pass CO2 extraction?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm able to pull an extract that has
around a 75% THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if I were to turn around and run
the already ran material that I ran for
[SPEAKER_06]: CO2 in ethanol, I would be lucky to get
maybe a one to two percent return.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that by weight, one to two percent of
the total weight?
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But instead of running it for CO2 and
pulling the cannabinoids with CO2,
[SPEAKER_06]: I just remove all the lower- well,
not for all the products, but for the high
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene absolute in particular.
[SPEAKER_06]: All those lower molecular weight product
or components are completely removed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the cannabinoids are left for the
extraction of the cold critical ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're able to fractionate out a
wax-free, lipid-free fraction by doing
[SPEAKER_01]: differential letdown of pressure to where
you're getting an enriched cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that THCA or is it THC?
[SPEAKER_06]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's around 89% THCA, 88% THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so you could prepare THCA this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's actually- so the question
cool thing, too, is everybody's doing
[SPEAKER_06]: these high terpene extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really wanted to do my own rendition
because I really originated dabbing
[SPEAKER_06]: hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really am trying to steer away from
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I thought was really cool is with
CO2 and ethanol, I could create the same
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still had- I was talking to Sam and
it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: The THCA crystals still formed the same
when you do the waiting period for the
[SPEAKER_06]: hydrocarbon high terpene extract as it did
for the reintroduction of the terpenes to
[SPEAKER_06]: the absolute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're still seeing crystallization
after you add your terpene back into your
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 oil?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so after about like a week or two,
there'll be a layer between like the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid section and the terpene
section.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there'll be just these layer of
crystals.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can only imagine from what you and I
were talking- I haven't gotten them tested
[SPEAKER_06]: yet, but from what you and I were talking
about, I can only imagine that would be
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially THCA.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so they're separated.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've heard a lot of people who are
growing, you know, growing crystals in
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: My naturopathic friend was just telling me
the other day, he actually does a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: extracting as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's moving down to Oregon to do
industrial hemp processing for CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he was telling me like a year ago,
we're going to find out here pretty soon
[SPEAKER_06]: that terpenes are the best solvent for
extracting THCA.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I'm like seeing this and I believe
in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If only we could extract enough and then
be able to recover them to the same
[SPEAKER_06]: degree.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I mean, I guess we can,
but it's still not quite the same.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll jump in.
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of products are you going to
make?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I didn't actually- I do the terpenes,
CO2 in the rod, and a vape pen cartridge,
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as the high terpene full spectrum
absolute, which is kind of like a crumble,
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of a sugar wax, I guess I'd say.
[SPEAKER_06]: But here is- I'm not sure if you guys can
see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is some Gorilla Blue Terpene.
[SPEAKER_06]: What yellow, Ed?
[SPEAKER_06]: How many different- Yeah, so those are the
flavonoids is what I've been told.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many different terpenes do you
actually find in that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you measured it with a GCF ID?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and so that's the hardest thing is a
lot of the analytical laboratories down
[SPEAKER_06]: here as of recently could only test for
about a year ago, it was 26.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I think it's 40 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these have, I would say over 200
chemical constituents that make up that
[SPEAKER_06]: profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: With terpenes, flavonoids, canaflavins,
and the whole kind of plethora of what the
[SPEAKER_11]: whole- Is this for smoked material,
or is it for oral?
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be for both.
[SPEAKER_06]: I re-add it into absolute for flavor,
and we have people putting it on ice
[SPEAKER_06]: cream.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to put it in my water bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put one drop in a 32 ounce.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, putting it on all kinds of food and
pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been making some kind of topicals
out of it, but it's just so expensive to
[SPEAKER_06]: make topicals out of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It requires so much for it to even kind of
keep the potency even if you're using some
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of binder.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just curious what all the terpenes in
it actually are.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have to be tested for all the
terpenes for you to find that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not testing for as many as maybe
SC Labs is down in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, do you guys know how many they test
for?
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't heard anybody testing for more
than 50.
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for we did 20 years ago,
we had about 100, but there's 150,
[SPEAKER_11]: so even we were only testing for
two-thirds, but we tested for all the more
[SPEAKER_11]: common ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: The ones we weren't testing before were
rarely found and in tiny, tiny,
[SPEAKER_11]: tiny amounts.
[SPEAKER_10]: We probably have, or what do you guys
think that we have the majority of the
[SPEAKER_10]: main layers in the terpene world are being
tested for, and the ones we're missing are
[SPEAKER_10]: rather minute, or do you think there's
still some real pharmacological
[SPEAKER_10]: effect-wise layers that we're missing?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Which Sam are you talking to?
[SPEAKER_11]: You, God damn it, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's two Sam's in the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well anyway, Puppet Sam,
I'm going to address this comment to you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Myself, John Mark Herring, and the people
at Scientific 710, Clancy, we are
[SPEAKER_12]: obtaining from Japan a heat pump that uses
helium that will allow us to reach
[SPEAKER_12]: temperature of minus 140.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, we're not going to shoot for
the minus 140, and it's a sterling engine.
[SPEAKER_12]: What we're going to do with it is shoot
for somewhere around what the current
[SPEAKER_12]: temperatures are, at minus 80 or minus
100, and see if we can't gleam some of
[SPEAKER_12]: those other terpenes that have been
missing up till now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We defined over 50 terpenes in the average
sample we analyzed, and we only had 100
[SPEAKER_11]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: If we would have had 150, all of the
terpenes that have been ID'd in cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: so far, who knows?
[SPEAKER_11]: We might have found 60 or 70, I really
can't say.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, do you think it's because of the
temperatures, or because some of the
[SPEAKER_12]: plants just aren't growing, all the
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sort of siding with the fact that we
haven't got cold enough yet to condense
[SPEAKER_12]: some of them that are very low.
[SPEAKER_11]: It may also be that some of these terpenes
are more found in early growing and young
[SPEAKER_11]: juvenile plants, rather than really,
really adult plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: I myself always like to grow my plants
until their resin is really fully finished
[SPEAKER_11]: adding on.
[SPEAKER_11]: The smell definitely changes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I assume maybe some of the really,
really volatile ones are being lost,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I don't have any proof of this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just assume it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I extracted a couple of brand new
fresh plants that I chopped down this
[SPEAKER_12]: year.
[SPEAKER_12]: I cut them down, and 10 minutes later,
I put them in the extractor and extracted
[SPEAKER_12]: them.
[SPEAKER_12]: The flavor and the taste from them is
pretty much off the charts.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's truly one hit stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can take one hit off, but it tastes like
a fresh flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's like a brand new fresh flower
right away.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm thinking that concentrates probably
are going to head in this direction.
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, John, I patented, excuse me,
I copyrighted the term fresh flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Andrew, walk away from your mic a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're blowing up the speakers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're too close to the mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to be back.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that any better?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see what the audience says here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, anyway, I'll send you 25 cents,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Mr. Hideous had the funniest
comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, the mic is inside his mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were coming through loud, loud and
clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you, blowing up my speakers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I got a new microphone and I didn't
know how it worked on other systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm letting you right now know it works
exceptionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: You definitely don't have to be so close
to it, but that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Keegan telling us a little bit
about a CO2 extraction earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you going to throw something in the
column and run a batch, or is that just
[SPEAKER_03]: not going to happen today?
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes 20 hours to do a run.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_12]: What a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_12]: That system takes two hours to do a run.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keegan, what's faster, a terpene run or a
cannabinoid run, or are you doing them
[SPEAKER_11]: simultaneously?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the story?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I'm going to be doing pens,
I'll do them simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I'm going to be doing HKFSA,
I'll just do the terpene run and then I
[SPEAKER_06]: use a shop vac and all that stuff gets
sucked out and then ran through cold
[SPEAKER_06]: critical ethanol.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cold critical ethanol takes no time.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only bottleneck there is just the
evaporation of solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: What part of the process, why does it take
20 hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is that time spent during the run?
[SPEAKER_02]: Two hours per pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in the soak time in contact with CO2?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just in the processing time.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's stalled out, you're not flowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's flowing the whole time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's continuous flow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's continuous flow for 20 hours.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're flowing it through that thing at
how much per hour continuously?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, what's that?
[SPEAKER_12]: How much per hour are you flowing through
the column continuously?
[SPEAKER_12]: For 20 hours?
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not sure the actual CO2 flow rate on
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: What pressure are you putting in it
through there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywhere from 17 to 1800 PSI.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it takes 20 hours?
[SPEAKER_12]: 20 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My runs take like 38 to 42 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much material is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason is because you see that giant
green thing right there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right in the back part right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a giant diaphragm compressor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't exceed too high of a PSI,
but it allows me to keep everything super
[SPEAKER_06]: cold so that those terpenes don't exceed a
temperature of, realistically,
[SPEAKER_06]: after the CO2 crosses them, they don't get
hotter than 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll bubble up your bubble if you leave
it out in the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, not Fahrenheit, sorry, Celsius.
[SPEAKER_03]: Celsius, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll bubble up your bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left bubble drying in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in the shade at the time on some
cardboard, but I guess the sun came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I went out to grab it,
it was like bubbling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a lot of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always surprised about the hottest
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, tell the truth, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the butane.
[SPEAKER_12]: So Keegan, the next year in Northern
California, you should stop around.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I can kill a lot of time out of
your very lengthy process that you're
[SPEAKER_12]: doing and make things go a lot easier for
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the CO2 or for the ethanol?
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever it is you're doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: 20-hour process for the CO2.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure I can help you improve on all
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you are, hang on, Indra?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to meet you, Indra.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, pleasure to meet you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I listened to what you had to say this
morning, and I thought you could use a
[SPEAKER_12]: hand on some information that your other
friend who taught you how to run this
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe didn't have to give you any advice
on how to do it.
And I think that's something that we can
all work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's important to understand
that there's so many different methods and
[SPEAKER_03]: all the different ways to acquire these
unique components that clearly are beyond
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say I would go as far as saying
that they are a dietary need for humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why wouldn't we come up with as many
cool ways to get them off the plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: get them into our bodies?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no such thing as all right and all
wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's benefits and advantages and
disadvantages to each one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring in more ideas and more methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Indra.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a positive.
[SPEAKER_12]: Faris, I'm gonna send you by courier
Monday morning a pint of this very pure,
[SPEAKER_12]: very delicious CBD oil that always leaves
me with a feeling of wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know how much you guys go
through, but I hope a pint is helpful.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can come up with a pint a month for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, a pint is of course, absolutely
helpful.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw the message on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just not on much.
[SPEAKER_10]: And even if some people see posts once in
a while, but it's more just as I'm sure
[SPEAKER_10]: you guys know to try to keep the presence
going and awareness for our projects.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I hope you got my response and I was
gonna be willing to even drive up and say
[SPEAKER_10]: hello, but that would be incredible.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, Indra.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one pint?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, only a pint.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we can help lots and lots of people
with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: The thing of it is the guy who's supplying
me with the raw CBD oil that I have to
[SPEAKER_12]: winterize before I send it to you has also
agreed to lend a hand and give me a
[SPEAKER_12]: certain number of kilos every month to aid
the kids.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're gonna get be getting two or
three times as much as that because my
[SPEAKER_12]: friend was very touched by the kids and so
forth and he wants to help too.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that in that case, no, thanks.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I can't thank you enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, back to the buyers a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a big concern of mine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now it's something that I don't
really feel right talking about my
[SPEAKER_10]: concerns with so many people losing
things, but we just had a huge uptick.
[SPEAKER_10]: In families that have come forward because
of some online attention, we had a couple
[SPEAKER_10]: posts go viral.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me see if I can share this with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: So some of our kids are really coming
forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of our families, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a little guy read and these
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that picture coming through?
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys see that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are moving forward, which is
great.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what happens is, you know,
we we get a large intake in families who
[SPEAKER_10]: are looking for help.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a little boy with epidermolysis
belosa.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when that happens, we get a huge
intake and we lost a lot of some of our
[SPEAKER_10]: partners in these fires.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just really want to make sure we can
make commitments and help as many families
[SPEAKER_10]: as we can.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I don't want to get all
touchy and emotional on us now.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, Andrew, not only is that thank you,
but I really can't thank you enough for
[SPEAKER_10]: anybody who wants to step up because more
now than ever, some of our commitments
[SPEAKER_10]: that we've made to families on projected
donations is kind of up in the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: And nothing scares me more than having to
call family back and tell them that we
[SPEAKER_10]: were wrong and we can't help them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't know if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_12]: I could also give you some THC oil,
too, because we end up with a lot of it
[SPEAKER_12]: over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't really do anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can only smoke so many dabs at a time.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you want some THC oil to mix with it
as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, oh, yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we don't even more valuable for me
because it's really hard for us in our
[SPEAKER_10]: old-fashioned methods to get really good
quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you have to heat it in order to get
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Our process is completely cold.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it'll be alive.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, like I said, that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're going to come visit.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, a little career.
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to send it to you right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll save you guys a drive.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't have to come here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have anything at the house.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't do anything at the house.
[SPEAKER_12]: We do it all elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you wouldn't get to see anything except
my ugly old face.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't tell you how much I appreciate
your persistence with getting that to us.
[SPEAKER_12]: This guy here, Link.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm not persistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are persistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to welcome Sub like three
times in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, welcome, Sub.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Sub Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Sub.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Sub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: How y'all doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you got your new hat.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely celebrating the course of the
mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we raised on last night, me and the
guy sitting over there, Dago, we raised
[SPEAKER_00]: $30,000 over a couple of day period for
the victims of the milk alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We raised $15,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we raised $15,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another group, $15,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another group, $15,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So total, the Weed Nerd Nation Roundtable,
Fata Mike Group, they raised $45,000 for
[SPEAKER_00]: people in milk alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going straight to Pat, Soil King,
and it'll be given out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No GoFundMe, no 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy dog food, buy horse food, buy
generators, buy diapers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live where I live, you can drive to
Soil King, and you can say, I'm fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a refrigerator, and he'll take you
to Walmart and buy you a refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to hear you say that because the
other day on my wake and bed, people were
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, what's the links?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you put up the GoFundMe links?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk to Sub.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make sure all the links I
share is the proper place that you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: be donating to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And man, I got people like, why would you
say that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're keeping people from
donating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, because I want them to donate
where it should go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to definitely want to put
up all the links.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's funny that you say that,
Mark, because it leads me right into a
[SPEAKER_00]: segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of started with people right
away, say, raising money for me and Jill,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we lost everything for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so immediately, I turned it into any
money raised for me or my organization is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be donated to the victims of the
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Patrick got involved on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have to go through any red
cross or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely, the links that we're
working on through the stream nerds and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, those checks, the only way
they work is if like you buy a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from us on the auction or a poster,
you have to give the money to Pat and Pat
[SPEAKER_00]: shows us the receipt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the receipt shown us,
we send you the prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was with Pat driving around buying
dog food, goat food, yeah, goat food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and if you I'm going to shut up after
this and smoke a bowl with you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you'll go look at my Instagram,
you will see what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eighteen hundred homes in one
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place is on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no food.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not like anything you've ever seen
before in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a place to live and I have
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's no fucking hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hilton burned down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fountain Grove burned down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoke is so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go back to the area, you're choked
to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to have an infusion tomorrow
and we're going to do it in a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to do the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this is Armageddon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know if you see the news
that we see, but everyone lost their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nurse lost their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends lost their home and we don't
have anywhere to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys can can help or shed light
on the plight of people out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: please do so.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, so you got definitely got places to
go here in eastern California.
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be spend an hour drive from you,
but if you need to kill some some weeks
[SPEAKER_10]: out here, we definitely have some places
for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So do not hesitate to ask and come do a
little vacation up here at the lake and as
[SPEAKER_10]: you get things put back together.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to understand, though,
I've got a chihuahua and a very mouthy
[SPEAKER_12]: parrot here because it's forty five acres
and there ain't nobody bothering us.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we got a good Internet connection and
talk about a little messy.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, as it turns out, I have to look at
Indra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have to look at Indra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it turns out again, I'm a survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they let me, I'm going to go off a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once they let me go to my house and we
can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my lawyer says enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says we're going to meet at the police
line on Monday or Tuesday and he's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to my house and the fire's out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The area is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, to be in the cops would
be just full overbearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand they need to protect
people and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my fucking house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a million dollar home that burnt the
fucking ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to go up there and see what it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nine days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't said that when I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to just signed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're working on signing a contract
on a new 400 light building to grow Jesus
[SPEAKER_00]: O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be cranking that up next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I mean, I'm not even slowing
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I don't have a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just go from here to there,
here to there and grow lots of ganja and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's going to happen in regards to
like insurance for all of these people
[SPEAKER_03]: that lost these homes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you got to think a ton of people,
some people must be insured.
[SPEAKER_03]: For their house burning down or do people
just like if you got a home loan,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a great topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a home loan, you have fire
insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't fucking bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give you hundreds of thousands of
dollars about fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless your dad gave you the house or
you built the house, you got fire
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got fire insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just I'm going to be real
hardcore and tell you what fire insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me, the very first step is they gave me
four thousand dollars a month to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I told you I won't take
charity money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have a lot for food and replace
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I blame I don't have a blanket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a pillow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get that shit eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the first thing you do is you
write all the contents down of your home
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's gut wrenching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my suggestion if you have to go
through this is not write down the
[SPEAKER_00]: bracelet because that has no money value.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to write down five refrigerators,
six TVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hit the maximum allow they'll
pay out for property.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's twenty five thousand dollars or
thirty thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is, you got to hit that once
you hit that to cut your check.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't you don't really need to say,
oh, I get my kids first baby picture
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's heart wrenching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish they'd tell you this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they will establish the value of
a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case, they say my home's worth about
six hundred thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't build it for that where I live
because there won't be enough two by
[SPEAKER_00]: fours, builders, semen or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you take your cash out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have a loan on my home remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's around three hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take the three hundred from the
six hundred you give, you give three
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred thousand dollars left over and you
can't live in a home for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you still have to take another damn
loan out when your house burns down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the logistics of your house
burning down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And worse, you have to go to the rubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't just get the fuck off and
not deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to just move on, but I have
to go deal with the fact that I own three
[SPEAKER_00]: acres of rubble.
But.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antibus land and I don't have any fucking
neighbors anymore, so I won't be selling
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's also crazy that it's not just
like you're dealing with your house
[SPEAKER_03]: burning down, you're dealing with your
house burning down while everyone around
[SPEAKER_03]: you is dealing with their house burning
down, which really changes my nurse.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me my infusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that gives me my infusion,
his house burned down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my nurse and the medicine burned down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jesus, that's just folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took my.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has PTSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have a puff with you,
sub.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huff a little bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew you were getting blown out,
but I obviously sent you a message right
[SPEAKER_03]: away saying, dude, when I can offer help,
you know, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for those of you that do want to
help me or anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a simple thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait two weeks and ask us what the fuck we
need, because we ain't got a clue.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Forest just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my dog has PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't tell, you notice the token
three inches from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where he stays at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the fire freaked him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he's down with fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it had to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Must have freaked so many animals out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's 45 acres here for him to run
on to come see you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I am no joking aside,
and y'all can get mad at me if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I looked at my house,
fuck this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired of fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like fire and I'm not ever going
to live where you can burn to death again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can assure you that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was saying just with the impact on
Silas when we left, you know, he started
[SPEAKER_10]: seizing that afternoon.
[SPEAKER_10]: He hasn't had a seizure in 38 days and
they're just now stopping yesterday.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there is something that really is
terrifying about driving through fire.
[SPEAKER_10]: It four in the morning, you know,
and the fear that it brings, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: fire is fire is no joke and so cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just experience it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But those of you who have and when it's on
the side of the road and you feel that
[SPEAKER_10]: heat, there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like the fire in your fireplace
when it's a, you know, a thousand acres of
[SPEAKER_10]: heat.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is an amazingly terrifying experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, it's crazy because we get
this every year here in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, this year was very,
very bad for B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say it was Fort Nelson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong, but there was an entire
town wiped out as well here in B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: just a couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ridiculous amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might have been like a million
acres or something that got burned.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was very bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd have to do the Google.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fire in California forests for millions of
years.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a part of the natural.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're not passing it through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the worst urban.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you burn more houses in any time,
it's not trees, but trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burnt people's houses down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burned 18 hundred houses down in one
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has not happened before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eighteen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One fucking subdivision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's no problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you look at the and things like
this that have been there for a thousand
[SPEAKER_11]: years.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're scarred from fires every 100,
200 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is lack of, in my opinion,
and I'm getting trouble for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is lack of money to tend to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw 500 cops before I saw a single fire
truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not taking away from the guys on
the line fighting the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, God, the firemen are the baddest
dudes in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where I live, no fire trucks came.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a fire truck would have driven down my
street and sprayed water on my house,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wouldn't have burned down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven neighborhoods went down in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,800 in the next neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The infrastructure of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the story, in my opinion,
that's not really being told.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the other part of the story that
isn't being told is the PG&E lines are one
[SPEAKER_15]: of the major contributors to why these
fires started in the first place.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the crazy thing is PG&E is the first
one out there repairing those fire
[SPEAKER_15]: destroyed fire lines and distribution
points.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's I don't know where we're going to
find out the actual truth of where some of
[SPEAKER_15]: these fires actually started.
[SPEAKER_15]: But from what I've been told, this faulty
lines.
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually what causes the fire traditionally
has been lots of rains, lots of green
[SPEAKER_11]: growth, dries out the end of summer,
it freaking burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam, let me say, I really apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for snapping at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew and me have a much different
relationship, so I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you can ask anybody there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are talking about God and
laser beams and the government and Trump
[SPEAKER_00]: and not the wind was blowing 75 miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power line, whatever the whatever the
wind was blowing 75 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why my house burned down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the wind wasn't blowing 75 miles an
hour, the fire would have burned like it
[SPEAKER_00]: did two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked over there and we said,
oh, shit, there's a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we need to evacuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burned my house down in two minutes and
then it moved 15 miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And burned every house down because the
wind was blowing 75 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the trees.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I was saying when we were
evacuated.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the wind was like nothing I'd ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you combine wind with dry heat and
those fires and they move incredibly fast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they will chase you down fast.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not look at it and know it's a fire
so we can outrun it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it was terrifying how quickly it
moved through the brush and through the
[SPEAKER_10]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, for saw this last night and
I want to spend this real quick if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, last night, the outpouring
of help of people that want to help as it
[SPEAKER_00]: blows my mind, actually, and the way the
community has come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me personally, I mean, you guys know I
lost genetics, like genetics you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within three hours, we had 90 percent
of them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people call and say, sub, got your
blood wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, sub, I got your peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, sub, I got your cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make cherry guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while they're not in my hand,
literally don't own a seed or a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant right now, about 90 percent of our
core genetics are still around and people
[SPEAKER_00]: are working with us to help bring them
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so you guys know, if you didn't
pay attention, we found 500 seeds in my
[SPEAKER_00]: truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know what they are, but I won't tell
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So little thing last night, we auctioned
off half of them and raised thirty five
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other half, me and my new
partner are going to start to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain with this special seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called the Phoenix that rise
from the ashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we germinated seeds today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we germinated seeds today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you've done something different
before the fire to maintain your
[SPEAKER_01]: collection in a way like you're a vault,
a fire ready vault or a safe that people
[SPEAKER_01]: are the vault.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, looking back, I mean,
did there have been anything that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could have done to make your look looking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me looking back simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I meant to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking back, I should have removed all of
my genetics from one spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year we had fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you can do this all day
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed twelve hundred grams of hash
because that's what I've been making for
[SPEAKER_00]: three days with Frenchy and Bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that I probably would have
grabbed the most that I'm the most
[SPEAKER_00]: heartbroken about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are a list of 50 things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a laptop would have had my codes
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But about a year ago, I went to the store
and bought a two terabyte drive about size
[SPEAKER_00]: of a business card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put every photograph I've ever owned
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put every song and I put all my
files on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't pick the fucker up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost every photograph I've ever taken,
every photograph I've ever taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the white drive sitting there by
the mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just I can tell you for houses
burning down three hundred foot flames.
[SPEAKER_00]: Propane tanks exploding, wind blowing
orange flames into your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very hard to decide what to pick up
and run with your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could have backed that up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that I'm not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, theoretically, you could have a
backup at your sister's house or somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing you would have done
looking back, which is, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lesson for all of us because any of our
houses can burn down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the big one, though, because we
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifteen miles from my house, I mean,
we have over half a million seeds and 20
[SPEAKER_00]: of the moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we we plan it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, too, is you don't
always give my moms to all one people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's my biggest mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish I hope people that live in
this area with.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I screwed this up three years ago,
we had a threat of fire and I didn't worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people's houses burnt down
and they always talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked about a water catching
systems for my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have been smart and all these
other things that I never I never
[SPEAKER_00]: understood how serious wildfires are
because I'm not from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that it should be mandatory
to have a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: My well is shared was shared by my
neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about a piece of 14 inch
Romex and goes to the ground and comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking thing works and don't work
half the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pump guy is always coming up there to
work on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you turn on more than three water hoses
in my house, you don't have water
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was I thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a 20,000 gallon tank on the
top of my property with a valve that you
[SPEAKER_00]: open up and it just dumps water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have had a sprinkler system on my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can afford this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow weed for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't understand that my house could
burn to the ground and burn cinder blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to understand what I'm
saying for $15,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have prevented this to 5,000
gallon tanks full of water, a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: valves.
[SPEAKER_00]: My property is uphill and downhill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water would run gravity feed,
no pumps required.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I would have to do was run up the hill
and throw a valve and it would have dumped
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fireman said it wouldn't save my
house.
[SPEAKER_11]: What made the house catch on fire?
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it from the roof or was it from the
walls or from the surrounding trees?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's no surrounding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, I hate to be a dick,
but it's 75 mile an hour winds blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: fire into the T-111 and the T-111 just
caught on fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things we have seen, everybody's heard
this story, but if you guys don't indulge
[SPEAKER_00]: me, I love the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So day one, no clothes, no fire,
no food, water, toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day two, continuing of events,
evacuate five times.
[SPEAKER_00]: On and on and on, no clothes, staying in a
little hotel, scared to death,
[SPEAKER_00]: traumatized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The news is traumatizing the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's noisy and scary, smoky, you can't
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go into town with men to get a phone
cord and on the way I see the mall is
[SPEAKER_00]: empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day I see cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I swing in, I see cars, I play ball
with my dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of hits and I go in the
store and then I had some sound effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outside it's... There's fire,
there's destruction, there's cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I open the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a girl from Iponema.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every store was open.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one in the mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The music's playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like the fucking zombie
apocalypse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and got me something to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Brookstone, sat in a massage
chair, shot an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making flight of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went back outside and the
zombie apocalypse is still there,
[SPEAKER_00]: fire rings fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in a destruction,
go to the mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the weirdest shit I've ever seen in
my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, that's hilarious, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a not hilarious kind of way,
but what a fucking experience to just
[SPEAKER_03]: be...
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're in shock the whole time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in shock to the degree... We have a
joke, we say, and if you've ever lost a
[SPEAKER_00]: home, and I'm certainly not the only one,
thousands and thousands of people have
lost their homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say it very violently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say it burnt the fuck up in the house,
but it's just like... When you're telling
[SPEAKER_00]: a story, Mark, you're like, you know,
one time I met Bob Snodgrass and he gave
[SPEAKER_00]: me this really cool jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it burnt the fuck up in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, one time I met Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me this really cool... Oh yeah,
it burnt the fuck up in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the rest of your life if you're
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever, you know, whatever,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iandra gave me, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma gave me, or George Cervantes gave me,
or whatever book or signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burned the fuck up in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's comical at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a house burned down in Washington.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a 360 foot tall tree on the corner
of the house, that's First Street,
[SPEAKER_12]: and a bolt of lightning struck it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we had a 400 foot tall blue flame
that could be seen for hundreds of miles
[SPEAKER_12]: while we watched our house burned down to
the river rocks in the Basin.
[SPEAKER_12]: And all the while, I only saw a video
because there I was in India when it
[SPEAKER_12]: happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I don't do this very often,
but you know, we got this made up right
[SPEAKER_10]: here just for some PTSD and overall health
things we're concerned about with subcool.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is going to be going out soon as
we got an address ready to mail to this
[SPEAKER_10]: guy and see if we can get you not only
getting to supplement your health,
[SPEAKER_10]: subcool with all the stress, which is not
going to help, but, you know, see if we
[SPEAKER_10]: can get you, you know, some sort of help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the overall, I got to tell you the
fear force after I saw that yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do seriously hats off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the fact that you grab it,
just so you know, you grabbed the trade
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, I think not just mine,
but the fact that the fact that he had the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, I grabbed hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I grabbed hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I grew up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grabbed medicine for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd spent seven hours the day before we,
I had, he spent seven hours a day before,
[SPEAKER_10]: um, making, you know, medicine for
families and kids and have been,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, seeing subcool and the things
he's going through and wanting to put
[SPEAKER_10]: something together.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's all the way through my mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's like, what do you grab?
[SPEAKER_10]: And the one thing I thought of is if I
don't grab these lock, they have these,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, storage of these kids and
families medicines, then, um, I don't want
[SPEAKER_10]: to know what to do with myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the first thing that went in my
car in the family.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we got the, heck out,
you know, but as I was unpacking
[SPEAKER_10]: everything, we were fortunate enough to be
able to come back home.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, that's the first thing I saw and want
to know that it'll be, it'll be headed out
[SPEAKER_10]: here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just as soon as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, I want to tell you something,
you know, me a long time now and I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: make you laugh your ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was way back on the way back from
breakfast this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I thought of a fucking
course.
[SPEAKER_00]: My house burned down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I was at gypsy's house when it
all went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I was involved in overgrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I'm in the middle of the fucking
California thing burning down with my
[SPEAKER_00]: phone on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's see, you definitely always seem to be
there, but you always seem, it always
[SPEAKER_03]: seems to make you stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't come out all like, I don't ever
feel bad for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're always like, why would I feel
bad for him?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just going to like flourish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, and I got to tell you guys,
and I'm going to shut up and let the show
[SPEAKER_00]: go back, but they go, I got to give it to
Dago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and, and y'all can be mad at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my new thing, cause I really don't give
a fuck because I don't have a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's riding around in my truck,
streaming, smoking hash, talking to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cops, fucking with everybody, playing like
I'm going to run over people, having this
[SPEAKER_00]: commentary of whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's people, I have 300 people
watching me drive around and go buy donuts
[SPEAKER_00]: or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called riding nerdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're all stream nerds and weed
nerds, it's called riding nerdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ride around streaming,
hanging out with your homeboys,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking weed, talking about the culture,
you're riding nerdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Want to give a shout out to Claude,
my good friend in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just hit me up in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's I've never, I don't think I've ever
seen him in the hash church chat room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Claude.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up brother?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat rooms cooking along.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got 657 viewers in the room right
now watching and listening and using the
[SPEAKER_03]: hashtag ride nerdy capital on that or a
non-capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, scone of FARC says he trademarked
riding nerdy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little does he know, Sam, did you want to
let scone of FARC know that you've already
[SPEAKER_03]: trademarked that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually it slipped through my
fingers somehow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the only thing to top that is to put
on weird out, weird out Yankovic's white
[SPEAKER_15]: nerdy to go along with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you're fucking riding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy's already on that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting week though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine like, you know, me,
I'm, I don't want to go back, but I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a gun safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all the seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it with a drone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I got, I got people, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are out there looking at the shit,
but the house burned the fuck down around
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can't be seeds in it that are any good,
but it's definitely a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to go up there with metal detector
and a team of people and fucking go out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and find us.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend's got metal detectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have like precious gems or
anything, but Jill's wedding ring was
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a couple of diamonds there,
but Jill has nothing like nothing,
[SPEAKER_00]: no wedding rings, no earrings,
no nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jill's an organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Jill were getting divorced the day
the house burned down and she's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got her house.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that's cool and shit, but she has
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a ring?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna go buy her a ring and send it
to her just cause you know, I mean that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has no jewelry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy doggo had a good suggestion.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants Mendo dope to write a song called
riding nerdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I done?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll text them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can already hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boys are up there with French
cheese machine, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're quiet and they're
washing with his machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, his machine's bad ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key to it is it doesn't chop the weed
and like I was using, remember I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: use sharpening up ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to believe he took a block ice and
busted it with a hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's French.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, you must not take it gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his idea is you spend the weed and the
ice on this big bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, but you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the bubble now does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen anything like what he did
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really, well that's a stainless
steel unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to compare it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that it's the same motion
of gentle mixing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy bought one locally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad boy bought one locally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's got Frenchie coming out to do a
little tour and I'm sure I'll be over
[SPEAKER_03]: there when they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's your big joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bubble now can't break your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: First night Badger's loading the machine
into Frenchie's car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Badger's hand is still fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smashing on the side of the truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, it weighs like 450 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool under the moonlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost all the footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the coolest part was Camille.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The camera got burnt the fuck up dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Frenchie dude, Frenchie stand there in
the moonlight, you know, so he's standing
[SPEAKER_00]: there in the moonlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the straight picture on my
Instagram with the lights from the garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: put this aura around him, but he just
comes down in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a much resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, fuck, thanks dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, it is so sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Frenchie can only tells you resin
is hard to work with and it's too thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus put it in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then bond came and we washed hash
for three days in a six by six gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: tent and we made 482 grams of beach sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I left the place with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the hash from the crop is in
people's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coldest ice concentrate has a bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchie has a bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four or five people, that rice has a bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got 60 cent of my crop out there and
turned it in the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least I get to smoke my resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I don't sit here and cry and not
get to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But losing the footage losing,
you know, you can still like shed a tear
[SPEAKER_03]: at least you're allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, damn dude, that hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm shedding tears for you and all the
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the stories were incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: The girl that threw her dog in her bag,
70 pound dog and rode out on the bicycle
[SPEAKER_03]: or the couple that hid in the swimming
pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three incredible stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave with Sonoma patient group and this is
not just not some great story like the
[SPEAKER_00]: pool or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I tell people I lost everything,
hey, I got my biker wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had a handful of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave ran out in his underwear through a
flaming door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this man tells you he escaped with
his life, he is for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got burns and he had to run through a
flaming bamboo screen and then kick a
[SPEAKER_00]: front door open to get out his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he he's burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty close right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with your underwears, that's a whole
other level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cardboard box seems pretty sad until
you're the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just like in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always think you're shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like you're in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some guys like, oh, your shoes aren't as
nice as mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy next to him doesn't even have
shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy next to him doesn't even have
fucking feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy next to him doesn't have fucking
legs or feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's there's always some shit like
where it's just like, OK, this just keeps
[SPEAKER_03]: getting worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's I'm not in the worst boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what your situation is,
you can be rest assured you're not in the
[SPEAKER_03]: worst boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, just because we talk about the
bad stuff, the good man, like within six
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, like I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the new way I grind with these
headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I can hear good, but phone rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit the button and it's just Leo for the
fish in Odyssey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a piano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, later.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little couple of words.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I've got your pinot noir that
makes Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just that is and I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys need a strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it isn't breeders that don't have
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle does not have to give us the
strawberry cough back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me the cut and we turned it in
strains and we make money on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't get any residual.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a nice brotherly thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brothers Grimm, soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Cleaners been offered to me by the
four people that have it within an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you have the Jack Mark?
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack the Ripper?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't you have my Jack Cleaner F1?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought bad boy gave it to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Cleaner F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, my mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I thought you had it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I never had Jack Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds more like bad boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I thought he gave it to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, bad boy never gave anything in
regards to genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: He held onto that stuff pretty hard core.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can't get this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get that away.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I got stuff, I just gave it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, here, have everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I just thought that it would be
better for people to have things than not
[SPEAKER_03]: have things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way, if something happens and you
lose them, the vault is the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Romulan, the Joe, Kyle and Romulan
didn't get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because two people have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, did anybody have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, yeah, he gave it to
me five years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen the Romulan in years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: More people weren't as giving with the
Jacks Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that one in years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I always loved the Jacks Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that that's part of
prohibition where if you can be the only
[SPEAKER_03]: one that has it and then you put it out
and then people are buying those.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like it's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mentality as I learn and meet people
like Forrest, I always tell people,
[SPEAKER_03]: what are you worried that some poor child
is going to find this as a medicine and
[SPEAKER_03]: stop and it's going to alleviate a massive
amount of suffering?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wasn't even thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're thinking about is,
oh, some other guys are going to ruin this
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar because they're not going to grow
it as good as me and they're going to give
[SPEAKER_03]: it a bad name or worse, they're going to
grow it better than me and I'm not going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to sell the shit that I'm
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both the wrong fear and scarcity path.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the basic nature of man,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's part of Wade's story.
[SPEAKER_10]: My Harlequin is known to so many people.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fact that it was given it away.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will say it's a public service.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be happy to be a bank for some of you
guys in these rare strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just as a public service, I want to be
there for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gladius Network, be happy to store them so
that you have a backup.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good use while I got them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an awesome offer because the
Gladius Network, it's high integrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like Forrest isn't going to
go start a seed bank in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you know that those right here,
they may be getting to the unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Mark, this technology and
this availability is just a wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, somebody like Forrest,
I have friends, Jason, the Fino Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got whatever a million plants or
whatever these guys can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But up until about a year ago,
and you talked about this, and I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: contradicting or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, as a breeder right now,
it's a new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trademark patent and protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about medicine because,
you know, guys, I'll give anybody the
[SPEAKER_00]: shirt off my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I've formed six seed companies
myself that aren't mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there definitely is intellectual
property that we have to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to get into something that's
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while a strain like cheese cannot be
trademarked or patented, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys know this, I spent a lot of money
to find this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, say, Chernobyl that I created
cannot be patented or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the bubble man cannot be patent
because this is in the public domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say Forrest grows out a and I'm not
going to use one of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say Forrest grows out Ringo's gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he finds a cut of Ringo's gift that's
23, 24 percent CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had some THCV in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had these combinations and that
particular plant made it was special,
[SPEAKER_00]: special because of that content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant can be protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to happen nowadays
because that plant needs to become
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had something that was 23 to one
and high CBD, high THCV, you would want
[SPEAKER_00]: that to become medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a company, you want to make
sure that the product that's in that box
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes to a patient is proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason you have to have trademarks
and protection, and I know I'm pissing
[SPEAKER_00]: people off, is because unscrupulous people
will take the same name, the same box and
[SPEAKER_00]: not the same product inside of selling
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just part of understanding the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's also when we have something
that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also I don't think that because
Kymaris spoke about this in the room as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that I think that breeding
will be done to specifically find those
[SPEAKER_03]: those numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think as many will be accidentally
popped in random bags, things that are all
[SPEAKER_03]: in the open domain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll take like pretty intense
breeding to create specific cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: profiles and profiles.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check your mics.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got a bad echo there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I want to throw in here for a second
that I really think that the idea of being
[SPEAKER_08]: able to identify specific medicines as
being from specific plants is coming with
[SPEAKER_08]: the analytical testing regimen that's
going to be in place, at least in
[SPEAKER_08]: California.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I assume that's happening in
Washington and Colorado and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_08]: that there's a certain amount of
standardization.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're coming to understand what cheese or
Chernobyl looks like when it comes from
[SPEAKER_08]: the analytical labs.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm really a fan of the idea that
cannabis should be an open source thing,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Prohibition has created an artificial
market, if you will.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the plant doesn't deserve prohibition.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a remarkable plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I'm preaching to the choir here,
but it must be seen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've said that the plant's really doing
the hard part, and it's like humans to try
[SPEAKER_08]: and keep an exclusive thing on it to turn
it into a profit-making thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's nothing wrong with making a
living from what we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's really essential when,
like if forests were to find a specific
[SPEAKER_08]: cut of a seedling line that we're working
with, that turns out to be something
[SPEAKER_08]: spectacular that's really needed by a wide
range of people for a wide range of
[SPEAKER_08]: conditions, it would be wrong to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I guess I'm putting the value
judgment on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it would be wrong to try and hold that
and make people pay for access to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plant's doing the hard part.
[SPEAKER_08]: All we're doing is identifying those
plants and then taking care of them in a
[SPEAKER_08]: way that allows them to be made into
medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really my point of view.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not quite exactly true.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some cannabis varieties are bred for
specific cannabinoid terpene content.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it can be a two, three, four-year
process involving a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_11]: a lot of growing, a lot of research with a
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it can be a very expensive process.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the people who do that shouldn't be
discouraged from doing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: They should be encouraged.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't we want to find out more about
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't we want more sophisticated breeding
instead of less sophisticated?
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see both sides of it and they're
just different sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like when you come from one side of
it and what you're doing, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, that's open source for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I also understand someone's
spending.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to mute your guys' mics so it's
doing the whole echo.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was Wade's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also understand the spending money on
lab technicians and machinery and testing
[SPEAKER_03]: and greenhouses and people to work in
those greenhouses and the years of work
[SPEAKER_03]: that can be done to actually produce a
plant that is unique in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see both sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I sit with Wade in the sense like,
yeah, really, I love the utopian version
[SPEAKER_03]: of it should not be held over people's
heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, in every other
aspect of life, it's hard to like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you would be discouraged in business if
you were just like, yeah, and by the way,
[SPEAKER_03]: after you spend this millions of dollars
of your own money, self-fund everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not getting paid back because you
shouldn't really be able to profit from
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tough, I see both sides.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe both need to be both nonprofit and
for profit because unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_11]: nonprofit will not drive the industry as
quickly or as open as for profit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have nothing against people
profiting from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: I prefer they didn't do it from people who
need medicine, but except for that,
[SPEAKER_11]: for recreational, which is the majority of
cannabis use, I see nothing wrong with
[SPEAKER_11]: people making a profit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think in the future, that profit will be
a lot smaller, but yeah, we haven't gotten
[SPEAKER_11]: there yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just reminds me of kind of like,
it's just hard to really put your thumb on
[SPEAKER_03]: it exactly, but there's something in that
dialogue for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade, there's something to be more
discussed in that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I want to totally agree with what Sam
said.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess for me, it really has to do with
if that plant is providing something that
[SPEAKER_08]: a family or an individual needs for their
life, it seems wrong to make them pay,
[SPEAKER_08]: especially a lot for the opportunity to
have access to it, whereas we all know
[SPEAKER_08]: that cannabis has many expressions that
people really enjoy enough and aren't in a
[SPEAKER_08]: situation where they have to have it,
where there's room for folks that have
[SPEAKER_08]: discretionary income.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time someone's catastrophically
ill, typically their family has no money
[SPEAKER_08]: left.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then to ask them to pay out of pocket
large amounts in order to have access to
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine that can help their child is,
yeah, that's where it gets hard for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there's a lot of room,
as Sam said.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam nailed it, so I'll shut up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to have to reinvent the
wheel here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a lot of times with cannabis,
we walk into it like these questions
[SPEAKER_10]: haven't been asked before, but cultivar
rights and proprietary rights,
[SPEAKER_10]: isn't the new thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: People do it with melons and tomatoes and
all sorts of other things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a law there that people can
look at.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to pretend to be an expert
in it, but it's just hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: They fight that today with certain melon
varieties, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's hard to sell it and hold it at
the same time, because what do people do?
[SPEAKER_10]: They breed that melon a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_10]: They breed it with another melon.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bit different than they name
it, their new melon.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's one of those double edged swords
where yeah, a lot of work goes into it,
[SPEAKER_10]: but the plant is only going to allow us to
own it so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the only real way to keep a strain
yourself is to just not let it out
[SPEAKER_10]: anywhere and make a singular product out
of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the big boys do, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: GW Pharmaceuticals has a couple of strains
that I would kill to get my hands on,
[SPEAKER_10]: but they're not going to let it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where I hope that we find a
good balance in between those two,
[SPEAKER_10]: because like has been said over and over
again, there's just that balance between
[SPEAKER_10]: the work and the money put in and the
right to profit from your hard work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the point where the only way to really
control it is going to be in a way that
[SPEAKER_10]: really limits the amount of people who can
have access to it to such a degree that
[SPEAKER_10]: almost no one can.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look at the big numbers and the big
picture and the whole country and world
[SPEAKER_10]: and planet, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that I need GW strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just know they have strains that I can't
find at the moment in the open market that
[SPEAKER_10]: are just really very specific cannabinoid
and terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing, however, the ones that Sam
gave them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Russo spoke about knowing that GW had
cultivars that were producing 15% and 20%
[SPEAKER_08]: of CBC, for example, as well as THCV and
CBDV.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was this spring.
[SPEAKER_10]: With specific, well, I mean, yeah,
they're out there everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just use that as an example of someone
who has a company that has some really
[SPEAKER_10]: uncommon strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the one that Dr. Russo mentioned,
I was at that lecture.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was high in CBC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what also made it really unique
is really high in the terpene lanolule.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for someone who's an anti-spasmatic
sort of, I've always got my eyes out for
[SPEAKER_10]: the compounds that have pharmacological
effects in that direction.
[SPEAKER_10]: My ears perk up with those sort of things
for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not going to get out because they
know that it's either you have it or it's
[SPEAKER_10]: out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see how we're struggling with how
to control that in between.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know if there is a perfect
solution for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you look at the cut flower
industry, what they do is, for example,
[SPEAKER_11]: you breed a new rose, you release it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's mass produced in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_11]: Colombia, several other tropical
countries.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you get royalties on it to the
breeder.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a standardized way of working
with trees, flowers, vegetables.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is with cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just not legal in America yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're doing it with roses,
then obviously it's not some huge like
[SPEAKER_03]: 800% interest for the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a small little amount.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a royalty fee for producing the clone
or the dried material or the whatever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it didn't crush the flower industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure as long as those royalties are
kept reasonable, it probably won't crush
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, already, in my opinion,
prohibition prices and the continuation of
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition prices right into the civil
disobedient dispensaries and then right
[SPEAKER_03]: into the licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The prices just never change.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've maintained the same price from
when it was totally illegal and we were
[SPEAKER_03]: being jailed to, hey, now you can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not fucking making it any cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to fucking get, you know,
LPs, like some LPs sell herb for five
[SPEAKER_03]: bucks a gram, which is like the great
deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's still like over $2,000 a pound
for something that, you know, that
[SPEAKER_03]: probably doesn't cost anywhere near
$2,000.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to crush the small farmer,
you know, because really you're just going
[SPEAKER_10]: to need a ton of money to participate in
an artificially inflated market.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, we see him panicking and
rightfully so here in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's scary.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the market that has existed for the
last 30, 40 years was never real.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was always artificial based on
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_11]: Without the risk, there shouldn't be the
reward.
[SPEAKER_11]: Quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're building tax structures.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is part of my platform with the
Colladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of it started because I looked at
the tax structures they're building and
[SPEAKER_10]: they're built off of prohibition and
prohibition prices, which aren't anyone,
[SPEAKER_10]: especially I would think congressmen and
women would understand.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've taken some economics classes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone who's taken, you know, your basic
economics class knows that it's the
[SPEAKER_10]: marketplace they're building this
infrastructure off of is not going to
[SPEAKER_10]: exist.
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as prohibition ends nationwide,
at least the way the United States work,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's artificially people say,
well, look at Colorado and others and how
[SPEAKER_10]: it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're surrounded by prohibition
and that market is going to be impacted by
[SPEAKER_10]: the prices around them and the necessity
around them.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, what we have now is just
this system that's being written and
[SPEAKER_10]: directed based off of prices that don't
even exist anymore, let alone,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, are going to exist in the
future.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's no.
[SPEAKER_10]: In most, I don't know how it's going in
Canada, but in most, there's no thought
[SPEAKER_10]: whatsoever being put in the cannabis
that's being grown to not sell.
[SPEAKER_10]: So not only is it the sales numbers
completely off based on prohibition,
[SPEAKER_10]: but there's absolutely no sort of
charitable work written into any of the
[SPEAKER_10]: laws.
[SPEAKER_10]: So essentially what puts places like the
Colladrius Network from, I would say out
[SPEAKER_10]: of business, but from being able to run is
the tax structure and requirements that
[SPEAKER_10]: are being written and how it's being
written more than anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just found a bag of Johnny B's Medi Kush
and I've decided that I'm going to squish
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like five or six grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need to hit some Medi Kush,
Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while I listen to the great
conversation and sometimes jump in and be
[SPEAKER_10]: a part of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, if anybody wants to back to that
mystery strains, you could see any of
[SPEAKER_10]: those high CBC, high CBC, middle bounce of
THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: CBC is tough to produce in normal plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: They do it by using a special variety,
which I found, which has what's called
[SPEAKER_11]: juvenile plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: It stays in the juvenile state instead of
fully flowering and it produces more CBC
[SPEAKER_11]: in that state, but it does as a full
flowered plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they have as far as their CBG
varieties as well, correct?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I know GW Pharmaceuticals has some
basically genetic fluke type plants that
[SPEAKER_10]: just produce CBG.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it doesn't trigger the next phase to
produce other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's lacking the next synthases.
Correct.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Sam, a specific question would one be
more likely to find CBC and CBG in
[SPEAKER_08]: abundance in genetics that took a long
time to finish or never finished
[SPEAKER_08]: flowering?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_11]: I found one and it was just different and
I felt it and I saved it for a couple of
[SPEAKER_11]: years and then we tested it, found out it
had CBC in it, small amounts, and then GW
[SPEAKER_11]: with my breeder found that the juvenile
flowering recessive genes were also making
[SPEAKER_11]: the percentage even higher.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they created varieties, clonal
varieties that had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they know the genes responsible that
they express the synthase for CBC?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a CBC synthase gene.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that known?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder, I'm just thinking about what
T1 life sciences did with synthase,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is can they put the synthase in the
yeast now and express it in yeast?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's what all of these folks were
doing because there was the German group
[SPEAKER_11]: and there was two other groups worldwide
that were doing this kind of preliminary
[SPEAKER_11]: work and various ones inserted various
synthases in and were able to produce THC
[SPEAKER_11]: from CBG or CBD from CBG.
[SPEAKER_11]: But none of them had made the entire chain
where they were producing CBG.
[SPEAKER_11]: CBG, which was then synthesized into the
next cannabinoid target.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it will be done and they were all
talking about targeting things like CBC
[SPEAKER_11]: and CBG because they're rare and difficult
to find compared to THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: What were the percentages of CBC that you
were seeing in those, Sam, if you don't
[SPEAKER_10]: mind me asking?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm remembering off the top of my head,
I think they weren't that high because
[SPEAKER_11]: they weren't flowering so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you consider it to how much CBC
you find in normal varieties, it was
[SPEAKER_11]: really a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was approaching 10% if I remember
correctly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a reason CBC can't be now bred
and isolated in kind of the same way CBD
[SPEAKER_10]: was where we were surprised to see 6% or
7% strains 10 years ago and now?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually you can.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can breed for it the same way,
but it's in very low levels.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas if you do certain tricks like GW
did, then you get it at much higher
[SPEAKER_11]: levels.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, Sam, long awkward pause.
[SPEAKER_08]: Long awkward pause, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what about that original plant that you
identified that I think you said that you
[SPEAKER_08]: liked it or that it stood out that turned
out to have some CBC that then you kept
[SPEAKER_08]: working with and eventually found this one
that had as much as 10%.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there anything specific that stood out
about the plant or made you pay attention
[SPEAKER_11]: to this?
[SPEAKER_11]: There was something I did not like about
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: In other words, I'm not particularly fond
of CBD or CBC.
[SPEAKER_11]: It had both of those, but more CBC.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're talking about something you didn't
like in its growing or something you
[SPEAKER_10]: didn't like in the use of it?
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't like the way it smelled,
the way it's general characteristics,
[SPEAKER_11]: the way resin from CBD plants is not
really super sticky and greasy oily the
[SPEAKER_11]: way THC is, but a little bit in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember, did you do any terpene tests
on that?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, unfortunately I never terpene tested
it, but what I did do was the seed was
[SPEAKER_11]: imported by a friend of mine from
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a direct Afghan seed import.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where we find the good ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you got some quiet time here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that I see Marcus setting up the
machine over there, but I wasn't on right
[SPEAKER_10]: away.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was still trying to get myself together
this morning, but maybe while we have some
[SPEAKER_10]: downtime, I don't know if Wade told you
about the adventure he had fighting off
[SPEAKER_10]: wild animals at his property and then
using cannabis topicals that we made to
[SPEAKER_10]: run some tests with.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wade, did you tell that story before I got
on?
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that Raccoon?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, I told the story last week and
showed my hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you can really see what's
going on, but I'm still wearing a splint.
[SPEAKER_08]: This thumb was torn up pretty badly and
it's healed up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, both hands were torn up real badly,
but this one I started using our cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: cream on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two days after I went swimming with the
Raccoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was pretty dramatic, the change.
[SPEAKER_08]: Literally, this hand is pretty much
healed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a couple of spots where there's
still deep wounds that are healing,
[SPEAKER_08]: but all the claw damage that happened to
my wrist and hand is gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was within the first couple of days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, what was it?
[SPEAKER_08]: On Thursday, three days after the attack,
I saw my primary care physician and showed
[SPEAKER_08]: him my hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did what's called a wound check.
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked him if he could tell which hand
I'd been using cannabis cream on because I
[SPEAKER_08]: told him about my healthcare approach.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he spotted the difference right
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked for a few minutes about what
that cream was and what I was doing with
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just want to say that a topical
preparation prepared for ready
[SPEAKER_08]: assimilation into the skin that has CBD
and THC and some of them still in the acid
[SPEAKER_08]: form, some of the oils that Forrest and I
are working with, not only helped a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: with the pain of healing and the itching,
but the new skin that's growing over the
[SPEAKER_08]: bigger wounds is really tender and it
feels like it's on fire if I touch it.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, if I put some of this
cream on, yeah, I've been working in the
[SPEAKER_08]: garden and taking down plants and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking forward to getting rid of this
splint this week.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the cream that you make for our EB
kids and bring it back to some of what we
[SPEAKER_10]: were talking about in the beginning with
Keegan there.
[SPEAKER_10]: That has, and we found a big boost in
efficacy when we reintroduced terpenes at
[SPEAKER_10]: the end of the process, a big boost in
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have those terpene isolates as well
like he was talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is expensive if you are trying to run
it into a really high level model like you
[SPEAKER_10]: would with smoke or vape material,
but it a little does go a long way with
[SPEAKER_10]: some of those those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that squish bubble man's got
going.
[SPEAKER_10]: How'd it turn out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Been pricing the short path distillation
setups and rosin presses for the Caladrius
[SPEAKER_10]: Networks Gold will be $100,000.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all been free in the next couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those Sasquatch machines look pretty
sweet.
Okay, so I had a quick question.
I was thinking about what I think it was
Indra had said a little bit earlier about
[SPEAKER_06]: was it being able to get down to like
negative 180 degrees to kind of find out
[SPEAKER_06]: what terpenes might be there?
[SPEAKER_03]: 140.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 140.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bubble man, I'm sure that you've done a
lot of lyophilizing of plant material for
[SPEAKER_06]: dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sure that I've done what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, a lot of- Lyophilizing,
freeze drying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say a lot,
but enough that I know about it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had done a batch on, shoot, maybe about
six months ago, and I had noticed that
[SPEAKER_06]: when pulling that vacuum and kind of
having that deep freeze that there were
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely some kind of terpenes that we
were pulling at those really cold
[SPEAKER_06]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't able to get those analytically
tested, but I thought that was kind of a
[SPEAKER_06]: really cool kind of panico piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Indra jumped off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liquid nitrogen's about minus 195,
so you don't really need any special
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you need is a doer, a supply contract
to get liquid nitrogen, and you're there,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was talking about a specific pump.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're talking about doing it without going
out and buying liquid nitrogen all the
[SPEAKER_12]: time, brain boy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Indra, stop deep-throating your mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: No deep-throating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, liquid nitrogen's pretty- Okay,
but listen.
[SPEAKER_12]: The stirring engine will reduce it down to
140, and I'm thinking that we will find
[SPEAKER_12]: some stuff in that area.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you're a big fan of liquid
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am about certain things.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also a big fan of collecting terpenes,
and I've been at it for a little while.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, and I think that we're headed in the
right direction with this Sterling heat
[SPEAKER_12]: pump.
[SPEAKER_12]: See, and then we'll announce what happens,
and if it's good, we'll make them
[SPEAKER_12]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all we're saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how to turn it down.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll have to work on finding out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just talk.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's already three feet away from my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that any better?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on point now, Indra.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to hit some of this Medi-Kush
rosin that I just made, thanks to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Sasquatch M1.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is, is if you're trapping your
vacuum lines and you're just using a
[SPEAKER_01]: simple cold trap, all you need is liquid
nitrogen inside a doer, and you could trap
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to wait for some company to
come out with some device that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: exist yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been used for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how you keep your vacuum pump from
not seizing up all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always the future.
[SPEAKER_12]: The exact reason that we're making it is
as an advanced system for vacuum pump
[SPEAKER_12]: saving, and on our large commercial
system, we're looking for a way to gather
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: We think that if we have the right
temperature and we bring it through that,
[SPEAKER_12]: that we'll be able to collect massive
amounts of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: The 710 scientific one that I have now
that we sell called the Blue Meany is a
[SPEAKER_12]: very excellent one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I find no problems with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had it tested.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we had some contaminated material
once, so it came up with some minor
[SPEAKER_12]: amounts of something in it, but we tracked
it down, what it was, and the machine
[SPEAKER_12]: works excellently.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just going to try to go through a
much colder machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: We might want to run it for a long period
of time,
[SPEAKER_12]: and liquid nitrogen is expensive.
[SPEAKER_12]: Over a long period of time, you pay a lot
of money for liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only that, for people that don't know,
when you order that shit, you got to use
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to just last forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It dissipates.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, within a few hours, even in a Dwarf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess depending on your Dwarf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolute bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can keep it for several days in a
multi-liter doer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, that's absolute bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have doers you can throw for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Two days is the most I've ever had it
stored for, and I've got a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_12]: the best money can buy Dwarfs here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that they don't fucking last
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a buddy have liquid nitrogen in his
garage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be best if you guys didn't talk
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: When one's talking, what the other does is
they close their mouth, and they listen,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you wait for your turn,
and then you say what you want to say in
[SPEAKER_03]: return.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll listen to this all day if you guys
want to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that one is widely
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liquid nitrogen is widely available to
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll tell you this much from a
person who was going to start playing
[SPEAKER_03]: around with liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: As widely available as it is, it was still
a bit of a pain in the ass to get it
[SPEAKER_03]: ordered up, and get the doer, and do the
whole all that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When there's that aspect of things in any
aspect of business, someone's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: come up with something that makes it
easier for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indra uses a lot of liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I use it for crushing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I use it for cryogenic crushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, for example, Mark, I know you
know about liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use it often?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use it to make sure that, again,
whenever you pull a vacuum, that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not pulling ... This is in what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about an extraction that
you're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about using it to trap anything
that you're pulling a vacuum on.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, high vacuum distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or anything that you're putting vacuum on,
including vacuum ovens, where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trapping something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to trap it somehow, and you trap
it cryogenically, typically with ... It's
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing more than what's called a cold
finger, which is like a really long test
[SPEAKER_01]: tube with a glass tube that goes down to
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things basically sit in another doer
that you pour liquid nitrogen into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, when you pour liquid nitrogen into
it, you can usually wrap a little thermal
[SPEAKER_01]: blanket around to keep it from
evaporating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those usually say good overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even kept those traps on a two-liter
cold finger for multiple days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can keep liquid nitrogen down there
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is that rather than pulling all
of that into your vacuum pump,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should be trapping that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, again, liquid nitrogen is the
preferred way of trapping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use slushes of acetone and dry
ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about minus 78, but liquid nitrogen
is minus 195.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should try to do liquid nitrogen,
if you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, dry ice acetone works to get you
down to minus 78, at least.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, anyway, I like our new deep cold
pump.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, you say it's readily available,
but I have to take a four-hour drive to
[SPEAKER_12]: get liquid nitrogen myself.
[SPEAKER_12]: I live in the middle of the woods,
but electricity is still being piped into
[SPEAKER_12]: me.
[SPEAKER_12]: A cold pump is a handy thing for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I use a lot of liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_12]: We go and get a couple of times a week and
bring it back, but we use it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't fill a 50-gallon drum up with
flowers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe 75 pounds of flowers, pour in a
quart of liquid nitrogen, cover it with a
[SPEAKER_12]: three-quarter inch plywood board,
count to 50, open it up, and I take a
[SPEAKER_12]: four-by-four to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Within about two minutes, I have complete
green powder down occupying only about two
[SPEAKER_12]: inches of the drum.
[SPEAKER_12]: I use it a lot, but I still prefer the
mechanical cold traps with the cold pumps
[SPEAKER_12]: on them so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, that's what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about offering options.
[SPEAKER_03]: All this information is about offering
options.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know about another option,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all options that people can have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just constantly get stuck in this sort
of like, no, this is what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what everyone's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, if we stayed with that,
we would never move forward and create
[SPEAKER_03]: things that were innovative and new and
exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you look at Keegan's lab there,
he's got tanks of CO2 there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same company that provides those tanks
also provides liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, yeah, is it difficult to get it and
difficult to get to areas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably, but in other more urban
areas or areas where you can buy
[SPEAKER_01]: compressed gases and liquids, you can buy
liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it expensive?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to rent the doers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole thing, but yeah, having it
around the laboratory is a really key
[SPEAKER_01]: thing for several reasons.
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, people are asking about using
CO2 to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, do not use CO2 to get your stuff cold
to crush it.
[SPEAKER_12]: CO2 inherently gathers a lot of water and
will make your stuff damp.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the last thing you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, welcome Alec from SC Labs in the
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that he just showed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on, dude?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, happy Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Showing up towards the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got another 15 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in the world of Alec?
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to pop in and catch the end
of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: If anything, just listen to the awesome
conversations.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I just got back from an event as
a conference up in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_09]: This event, New West Summit, it's like a
tech cannabis type event.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, so just got back to Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like some of the smoke has
subsided from Santa Cruz, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_09]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy how much fires are burning up
in Northern California still, though,
[SPEAKER_09]: yet fully uncontained or fully contained.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's I think only like 25, 30 percent
Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is crazy this late in the season,
just like no rains and mad winds and dry
[SPEAKER_03]: brush and trees just ready to go up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, it's it's it's really
fascinating to kind of see how the whole
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of cycle went with.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got tons of water earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if anything, that grew the grass out
quite a bit or extra Kinland burn.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, just it's never experienced kind
of from from within the state disaster.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's affected as many close
people in my life and friends and family
[SPEAKER_09]: that we have.
[SPEAKER_09]: In our community.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yeah, a lot of prayers and
blessings go out to everybody that's been
[SPEAKER_09]: affected and going through this really
difficult time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's been pretty brutal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Subcool was on earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was telling us about raising a bunch of
money through the weed nerds nation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been putting money together for
people in need and clothes and food and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty awesome to see at the
same time, people coming together,
[SPEAKER_03]: helping those most in need.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you know, that's that's been really,
really inspiring.
[SPEAKER_09]: An exciting thing, you know, kind of so
much people within our community that have
[SPEAKER_09]: resources and ability, you know,
whether or not that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of small donations or, you know,
kind of donations of cannabis or,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, just just crowdfunding and
mobilizing the effort to, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: help show support.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like, yeah, we as a community kind
of such obligation to do good with this
[SPEAKER_09]: plant and, you know, it empowers us to do
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so so I think anybody that's doing
anything in their power to donate or to,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, help raise relief towards these
Northern California fires, whatever type
[SPEAKER_09]: of, you know, go fund me or fundraiser or
what have you, I think is amazing.
So.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the point is to just do something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take your, you know, thoughts and prayers
and feel good about them at the end of the
[SPEAKER_10]: night.
[SPEAKER_10]: But don't, you know, you got to do
something physical.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take action.
[SPEAKER_10]: Donate money.
[SPEAKER_10]: Volunteer time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do something physical.
[SPEAKER_12]: My dad used to say that he said it
slightly differently.
[SPEAKER_12]: He would say, get off your ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's the old school way of saying
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm wishing for things to change is
great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hoping changes is cool, I guess.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, unless you get up and do
something to make change, you're really
[SPEAKER_10]: just kind of not doing much, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's no time to be an armchair
activist right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually doing something.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know people on the panel know that
because they live it and something that I
[SPEAKER_10]: try to model for everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's amazing what a little bit of just
deciding you want to make change will do.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a few hours of wanting to make
change and getting off your ass and doing
[SPEAKER_10]: something will produce more results than
the last two years of hoping and wishing
[SPEAKER_10]: and, you know, waiting for someone else to
make that change, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So everyone listen in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't wait for someone else to donate five
bucks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get to Soil King.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get to Subcool's group.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get to whatever whatever charity you see
is putting money to good work and just do
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just do it already, would you?
[SPEAKER_15]: You vote with your dollars more than you
actually vote in the actual any election.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, if you've got any kind of
spare change, you know, your spare change
[SPEAKER_15]: adds up when other people throw in their
spare change.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that adds up to people who have
absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've lost my house.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've lost in a fire.
[SPEAKER_15]: I told you guys a week before Christmas,
you know, done by my own hand.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know what it's like to lose
absolutely everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I unfortunately know what they're
going through.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's absolutely ungodly painful.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was a child.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was only seven.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't imagine being the responsible
adult with having the bills owed and the
[SPEAKER_15]: mortgage on the house, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then your savings and your
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_15]: And here you are.
[SPEAKER_15]: You were just trying to get yourself
legally set up with a farm so that you
[SPEAKER_15]: could be in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_15]: And boom, everything's gone in the blink
of an eye.
[SPEAKER_15]: And people have lost their opportunities
to move forward in even in the legal
[SPEAKER_15]: market here in California.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what's sad is the opportunities
lost because we have some very good
[SPEAKER_15]: people.
[SPEAKER_15]: But just by chance of where wind and fire
went, those chances are literally gone up
[SPEAKER_15]: in smoke.
[SPEAKER_15]: No pun intended.
[SPEAKER_15]: So anything that anybody can contribute
right now, I know the big problem is they
[SPEAKER_15]: have more than enough stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: They need help organizing and sifting
through and making sure this gets to that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know many of my employees actually
volunteered, went up to various spots
[SPEAKER_15]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to do just that, just to separate
clothes from sizes, from just trying to
[SPEAKER_15]: get things set so when people can come,
they can actually distribute this stuff
[SPEAKER_15]: properly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's not only just for it to be
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: It needs to be distributed properly.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's going to take some time.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it takes long hours.
[SPEAKER_15]: So not only is stuff needed, your
volunteerism and your time.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you're able to be within an area and
volunteer to come down, they need help.
[SPEAKER_15]: These first responders, go buy them pizza.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go buy them coffee.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go get them whatever.
[SPEAKER_15]: I see Californians out here who are
feeding them all the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: So do what you can.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every little bit helps.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if it's just spare change,
that helps.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if it's signing petitions.
[SPEAKER_15]: But as we were talking earlier,
don't forget us.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember, six weeks from now, we're going
to be having many benefits for a long time
[SPEAKER_15]: because it's going to take a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_15]: A very long time for this to change and
for people to recover.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is a time where we have to take
care of our own.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are no government.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no insurance.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is where we, on the other side that
we have been on the fence on, we always
[SPEAKER_15]: take care of our own.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is where we need to reach out.
[SPEAKER_15]: So do go through your closets.
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's clothing that you can donate,
go through your pantries if there's food
[SPEAKER_15]: that you can donate.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're a cook and you can get down
there and cook, Guy Fieri is out there
[SPEAKER_15]: cooking.
[SPEAKER_15]: And feeding first responders and people
right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: So people shit on him all the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: But mad respect, he's out there right now
feeding people, making sure that they're
[SPEAKER_15]: fed, which is a key thing right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: When people are in shock, just a simple
thing as food means more than anything to
[SPEAKER_15]: help get them and regain their self so
that they can regain their spirit so that
[SPEAKER_15]: they can have the strength to move on to
get to another day.
[SPEAKER_15]: And these first responders are exhausted.
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been fighting for days.
[SPEAKER_15]: Weeks now.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they need food, supplies, and
hopefully some respite.
[SPEAKER_15]: But every little bit counts, people.
[SPEAKER_15]: So don't forget, you have a voice.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can vote with your dollars.
[SPEAKER_15]: Please contribute if you can, where you
can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Trippy Sticks, Emilio.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's CHSN415 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was getting food for like a couple
hundred people the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, I'm getting food.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got them making it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's just driving out and getting food
to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was a really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes people don't want to wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to do their own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's another great way of doing it
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's really, really well put
all around.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's the immediate needs,
the volunteering for the first response
[SPEAKER_09]: and kind of ongoing response.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then for people that are far,
you know, I mean, you can't kind of put
[SPEAKER_09]: out there enough how, you know,
just small donations and money,
[SPEAKER_09]: like the Bernie Sanders 25 type dollar
donations just built up for across our
[SPEAKER_09]: community can be so impactful,
you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's so many different funds now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a, you know, trying to identify,
you know, which ones are which,
[SPEAKER_09]: but, you know, I mean, it would be really
great, you know, even if we could kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: put up some links to some of these local
fire reliefs, you know, there's,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the SoCo Fire Reliefs,
Sonoma County Fire Relief, North Bay Fire
[SPEAKER_09]: Relief, the Tubbs Fire Victims,
or Santa Rosa County Community.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the Mendo Fire, which is the kind
of cow growers wildfire relief funds,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is kind of organized by CGA,
the Nevada County Cannabis Alliance
[SPEAKER_09]: Humboldt County Growers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the Napa Valley Community Disaster
Relief Funds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's really crazy about so much of
this is, you know, a lot of the fires that
[SPEAKER_09]: have just been decimating Mendocino County
haven't even been really broadcast on,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, any of the news and TV.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot on TV kind of around,
you know, some of the fires in Napa and
[SPEAKER_09]: Sonoma and, you know, a lot of media
around kind of the vineyards and the
[SPEAKER_09]: mansions burning.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, you know, the kind of,
you know, the Redwood Complex Fire kind
[SPEAKER_09]: of, yeah, there's a there's a fund,
the Mendo Glen Redwood Complex Fire Fund,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, that's an important one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, it's like Mendo Fire for the cow
growers wildfire relief fund, like I
[SPEAKER_09]: mentioned, but anything anybody can do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's it's just such a dire time of
need, you know, and also to big ups to,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the absolute extracts,
Canocraft team, you know, their housing
[SPEAKER_09]: for the next, you know, four or six weeks,
something like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: 200 members and, you know, are kind of on
the ground and, you know, kind of helping
[SPEAKER_09]: in the ways they can.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so anything anybody can do to just,
you know, this is such a huge time for
[SPEAKER_09]: actions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, like Eti instead, you know,
a lot of people will say, well,
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any money to give.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's struggling.
[SPEAKER_10]: But time is some of the most valuable
things you can give.
[SPEAKER_10]: Human labor is expensive.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if you could not hang out at
home for the day and get out there and
[SPEAKER_10]: make deliveries and let the people who are
organized and everybody give you a job to
[SPEAKER_10]: do, that has direct real impact that you
can look back on at the end of the day and
[SPEAKER_10]: know that you played a part in trying to
mend some of these things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, too, you know, in this time
where, you know, a lot of people pulled in
[SPEAKER_09]: record harvests where, you know,
they don't necessarily have a tremendous
[SPEAKER_09]: amount of money to donate or have tons of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there are a couple of
distributors that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: making these initiatives to kind of
basically donate 100 percent proceeds of
[SPEAKER_09]: farm or donated cannabis back to the
different fire relief funds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, I know Altus Supply in
the Bay Area is doing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a couple others.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I want to even say the Cannacraft
team is doing something, something of
[SPEAKER_09]: similarity.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I definitely know that we've put the
word out for the Colladrius Network for
[SPEAKER_10]: families of kids who might not be
catastrophically ill, but children with
[SPEAKER_10]: epilepsy and other things who've lost
their medicine or those pediatrics sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis medicine treatments, those people
who are affected that might not have
[SPEAKER_10]: qualified initially, but are in a serious
situation because of the fires put out in
[SPEAKER_10]: a couple of venues to have them reach out
to us and we will do everything we can to
[SPEAKER_10]: keep them supplied until they can get back
on their feet and what they need again.
[SPEAKER_10]: So everybody do their thing and ship in.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, if people out there are hearing
that there's people in those communities
[SPEAKER_10]: where their kids are in a situation where
they're in trouble now, I hope they would
[SPEAKER_10]: get them in touch with us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try and put up all these
links in the comments section of this
[SPEAKER_03]: episode, but also on the Facebook hash
church page.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank everyone for coming out
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We rocked a good solid four hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or three hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three hours is solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time flies when you're having good
conversation and get going in deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, thanks Keegan for coming in and
sharing your time with us and showing us
[SPEAKER_03]: the CO2 that you got going on,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we'll be in touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll keep the links for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, Indra, thank you,
as always, for coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gladrius Network, Forrest Represent will
have that link put up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Etienne, always first in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Such an appreciative thing from my
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes life easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunkman Sam and Wade Laughter,
thank you both for coming in and sharing
[SPEAKER_03]: your stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.
[SPEAKER_13]: Adios.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adios, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Michelle Doane, play us out,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Play us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alec from SC Labs, thanks for coming in
and sharing some time, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Love you all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Samurai Sam, Sam High in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, thanks for coming out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for making this church happen and
instigating the conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Sam's idea to invite Keegan in and
then also to get in as much as we could to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talked about the fires and how we
could kind of point people in the right
[SPEAKER_03]: direction and show ways of helping and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Mark's going to play us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Marcus, for doing Hash Church.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long time.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thank
you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
