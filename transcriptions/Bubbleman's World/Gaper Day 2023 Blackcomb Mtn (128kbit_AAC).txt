[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going on everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is Gaper Day on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's May 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the last day of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be full mayhem up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people wearing jeans and costumes
and furry costumes and all sorts of wild
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going up with my buddy Craig.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw Andrew from Whistler
Technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably see a bunch of people up there
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to bump into Ryan,
good friend of mine as well, and sporting
[SPEAKER_01]: my unicorn cup back freshly from the visit
with Antidote and Che making hash in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Kootenays at Antidote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I'll be telling you guys about
the unicorn cup a bunch more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google unicorn cup in the Kootenays on
Rosebud Lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to hang out with me,
see me and any of the people that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging out with on the regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we'll be August 11th to 14th.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, well, I think I see some
guy behind me putting on a tutu back
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to film as much as I can today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how it all splices together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, halfway here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craig's got the pink on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinky Tuscadero.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be calling him all day with the Aruba
shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking good there, dinos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit, look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just walked through the muddy muds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The muddy muds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here we go for the accelerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couple of pond dippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a mad delay for the chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaper day, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this fog in the clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to make some of our own clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I don't see glacier moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even see Jersey cream moving,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need some gaper day.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: that fucking hurt.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're most welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: High fidelity rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Platinum OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craig just reminded me I made a mistake
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Rainbow Driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Platinum Line live rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Platinum Line.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good catch, Craig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still acting like my QA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some yahoos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot dogs are a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is this is your costume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: You win.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just ripping on the snow skate with the
leash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skateboard with a single ski.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harder than it looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially to control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the slush?
[SPEAKER_01]: I went down today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I go too far forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I went down so hard today in the
slush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocky road.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so there's the little ponds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Captain Vagina's on the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You neither.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have zero fucks left to give,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spent them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to that little shitty pond
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems like the pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll go down to the next pond
and do a lap.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we weren't staying up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: May the force be with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: May the force be with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, Craig.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta be just shaking your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not getting wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, me neither, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaper day's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craig and I are heading our separate ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, people were all you guys saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys saw some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's a wrap.
