Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: well I gotta say, I definitely like this
venue better than the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buck Marcel anglerfish, ready trapping and
air trapping work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the whole fish around the can and
the teeth and the radicello marble work
[SPEAKER_00]: for the eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I have to say, one of the most
stunning pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time I see it, I have a new
appreciation for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, you know, the line lines on
this piece work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could definitely see Buck, if you're
listening to this, I could see you at one
[SPEAKER_00]: point in time adding a small mouthpiece
here for an exhale tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you have your inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got your exhale where you
go and it follows it along the spine and
[SPEAKER_00]: it blows it out of the mouth of the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how sick would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it earlier when we hit a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I blew my smoke through the back chamber
here and it came out, but not as nice as
[SPEAKER_00]: it would come out if they actually had it
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was breathing the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's breathing the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a beautiful piece, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that tiny little drop of water on
the tooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made it look different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of cool too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow, the faint yellow, um,
in the blue is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a defe darkness pole and they've
just pulled it out further to get these,
[SPEAKER_01]: these different shades in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we loaded you one up yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me load you one up, some fresh frozen
micro astro bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's melting in the sun.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grab the camera and show them
up close for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It disappears like magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that is such a incredible piece of
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I think we have another amazing piece
of glass we're going to hit up next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say bye to the angler.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to take one of the most,
uh, in my opinions, just like it has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: technically difficult to pull and attach
glass like that angler fish with the
[SPEAKER_00]: technique of Marcel's Ratticello work with
the air trapping in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have an idea that it's an extremely
technical pipe and then to be taken back,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, more than 10 years, like almost
15 years to fish 2000, which this piece
[SPEAKER_00]: could have even been done, I believe in
1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was made for the new year
show of fish and it has the fish marble
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot and the five, uh, uh,
dolphins, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The five dolphins from what I believe
Marcel had told me was they each
[SPEAKER_00]: represented a member of fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, he had also, he also had,
um, the sound man and then maybe this was
[SPEAKER_00]: the light guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Paul Anguidoch was, you know,
he was a very important member of the band
[SPEAKER_00]: as was Chris Corota for the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as Marcel, when he talked to me
about this piece, when I first got it off
[SPEAKER_01]: a number of years ago, um, he explained it
that at the time in the whole community,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the borough scene, he hadn't,
or there hadn't been the tools and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the techniques needed to accomplish some
of the visions that they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pipe that we just hit, this pipe
represents absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to like, this is one of my most prized
pieces of art that I have in my
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have a history with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were the first person to ever,
ever have it brought to, brought up after
[SPEAKER_01]: it was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcel brought it to my house and he,
uh, he cleaned it up after the fish 2000
[SPEAKER_00]: show at the Seminole Indian reservation
there in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that where it went around for like
two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alligator Alligator, even longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a seven and a half hour set.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was tripping mad balls and he was like,
Oh, I was pretty sure it was going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: back, but he just send it out into the
trippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just, and then he always came
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he, I remember specifically this
for a fact, he came up and he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only thing this piece is missing is
your vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, you weren't at the show with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I had taken Marcel to maybe
his first fish show, which was I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: nine nine 99 in Vancouver, where I
miracleed, which was basically giving a
[SPEAKER_00]: free ticket, uh, 18 of my friends into
their first fish show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three rows of six seats.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close to the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the end, I didn't even sit
with any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up taping the show and I had to go
down on the floor and be in the taper
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, uh, he was in the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcel was miracles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you should get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to puff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what do you want to puff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a, there's so much selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: More astro boy is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this though, is this the cured stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste on that it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want me to light you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the least, let me drive your beeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to build up your flame a little
bit so you're not left hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a little bit tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, hitting with a beeline if you're
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I think you're all idiots,
but it's definitely like build up a big
[SPEAKER_00]: flame before you hit out of a certain
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly this one, which has,
uh, what I would say, um, the last of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower bowls, this pipe definitely has a
deep punched flower bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's no, um, pole bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a punched bowl right into the
can with the tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, I just can't believe how good this
hash looks in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's so lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time a unicorn dies, every time we
hit this, let's kill some unicorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's going to be a unicorn massacres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more about the pipe though,
from what Marcel is saying is,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the piece is sort of the creative
experience where he, um, had at the fish
[SPEAKER_01]: show where he envisioned the technique and
some of the tools that he was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: need to procure to be able to advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The borough craft and the, and the pipe
baking industry, um, him and Jason and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody when they were doing Washington
and, um, the, the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the dolphins represent the band
that created the pathway, the highway of
[SPEAKER_01]: creation, creativity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this rap is itself the creative
explosion and genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's surfing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a, it's a really historic
piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's genuinely a piece of art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dolphins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should go smoke with it on the ocean
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we should actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a case.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go hit the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That and like the octopus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big octopus phoenix.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to hit the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys out on the boat.
Okay.
Okay.
