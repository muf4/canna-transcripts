[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here late night in Amsterdam after a
nice dab session.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA guys that we just met.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never actually met neither of you
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been around for a couple of years
now Arjun?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won last year with the tangy that you
grew around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured DNA would choose no less than
the top of the pile for people to
[SPEAKER_00]: represent them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony had a little thing to share with us
so I thought we'd get this on film.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the, since we're in the red
light district, I figured the red light
[SPEAKER_00]: iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the red light iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: For hot pressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot pressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a, this is a oil slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a Teflon paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the new version of what people
have been doing for a long many a decades
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the cellophane packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's different pressing
techniques from different countries but
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the, this stuff is pretty high
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can heat this stuff up pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to 500 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we're never getting anywhere near
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're keeping this around 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is basically a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mini hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a little on button here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully it'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're in foreign territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so basically the idea here is you
turn that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's your little packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we're going to actually fill it
up or not fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all I have and I just want to
press a little piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to put the sweet scone dry
sift into the packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's heating up quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heating up very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just heat it up enough to get it
warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so my finger isn't burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's European if heated up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's go with that for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you use your finger to gauge how
hot it is and how, what is the,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the gauge based on your,
so pretty warm, but not hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could hold your thumb there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're definitely not seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you've burned through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if it's hot enough to burn you,
then you're way too hot anyway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might take a little second.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever blow on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a little hot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a little hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electricity here is way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pushing so much through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that takes like a long time in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you can go in close up on this dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty nice right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just put it close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blurred out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a little bit of garlic salt
tables, like sea salt, garlic salt,
[SPEAKER_00]: some pepper, like some kind of old world
spice, pig rind spice type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For keeping meat buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to close it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep close that and then see where the
edges are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of fold them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not like all the way, but just keep
them folded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this thing is skook them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how fast electricity worked
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably was about to burn it out real
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it did to the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burned out the whip fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I'm still attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you don't get any.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've burned the skin off.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, let them see what you're doing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just doing a simple little zippity
doo dah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry sift presses very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hardens very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back the other way now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was bubbling out, I noticed
there, hey?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how you got a little dark on the
color there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what you want right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that it's turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's where it's actually pressing
and melting hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enough to get it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to close up is have it pulled
all the way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll, not the camera,
but if there's any zoom on, and then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: open it up and show it to the,
or Tony can open it up and show it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to overheat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to just be gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a lot more gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's more than you thought,
hey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because dry heads are dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like very dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to risk going through that
electricity thing one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to zip it open and see what
it looks like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs a little bit more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do put it in the electricity,
just put it in for two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two seconds, that's all it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's almost, maybe, just needs a
little bit more finger working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoe hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put this in your shoe and walk
around Amsterdam all day, and you'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: this same piece of hash in your
possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I used to do years ago was heat up a
marble slab in the oven, boil some water,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a wine bottle, and before we
went over the packets with the hot boiling
[SPEAKER_00]: water in the wine bottle, these packets
were wrapped in newspaper, moistened with
[SPEAKER_00]: water, made wet, and then put on the stove
on low, and it would steam the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, it needs a little bit more warmth,
and then it'll go all clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sweet, sweet skunk smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do two seconds and get it warm
again.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to go less than more the first
time, because then you're just fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't want to boil it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two seconds, Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't address it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to go less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that is amazing fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't think it was possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went four, because I thought perhaps you
were wrong, and it needed four seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's like ready to blow up in five
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Detonation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns right through skin in four
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's ready to curl their hair that fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're plugging a 110 into a 220 volt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the size of my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pure electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like spark plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gentle.
That's warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it could keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way across, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be nice and clear through
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could always throw this into a
freezer, inside a Ziploc bag, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: inside a freezer to get it to really be
brittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be amazed at how brittle
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was just going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we open this up, it's just going to
be cracky shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I peel it off, it'll probably even
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially because it's cool in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nice cool air is like cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is dry sift friendly temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably about eight degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe five degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look how clear that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now peel it off while it's
still warm so we can catch a look at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will crack not long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, it's still a one piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still fits and is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can fit it back in there
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how it goes?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes and match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we puff out right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you even push that little ball
down a little bit more, I think it would
[SPEAKER_00]: have cracked into three pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go dab it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make it a little smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each 2-0 shatter now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when you press it thin like that,
it's just... All right, let's see if we
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too baked for dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just use the actual tweezers.
It's not going to be turps either,
that's for sure.
All right, let's see if we can do it.
All right, let's see if we can.
