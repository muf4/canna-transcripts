Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: About to go live here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about good timing, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_05]: Geez, if I hadn't sent it to you,
I'd be in here alone right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashturch 4.0, episode six.
[SPEAKER_05]: Potentially going to be a very small,
intimate Hashturch today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me, Etienne?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing this morning?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm doing good, sir.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just kind of woke up and like,
oh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I must not have your email because
I used to do all the invitations via that
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook messenger, and I just sent out an
email to the same group I sent out last
[SPEAKER_05]: week, which I remembered, or the week
before, which I spaced having you on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, it was kind of last minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Colin said he tried to come in and
the Dragonfly Earth Madison said they
[SPEAKER_05]: would try to come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Mark, Mark Sheldon also,
Dr. Mark said he would try to come in and
[SPEAKER_05]: even Napro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it was Napro Mark, too, that instead
of Mark Sheldon, I can't even remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I didn't even invite Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even remember now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have a little gathering here,
even if it's just you and I, we can chat
[SPEAKER_05]: for a little bit and discuss what's kind
of going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just like being available for the good
folks here that are waiting on the regular
[SPEAKER_05]: for us to come on these Sundays and kind
of a nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice way to spend an hour or two on the on
a Sunday morning, so.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how are things been going in your neck
of the woods?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fall coming in, it's harvest.
[SPEAKER_13]: How is harvest coming along?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I got to say, like from an
outdoor situation, I have just seven small
[SPEAKER_05]: plants on my deck and I got to say
they're.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking phenomenal, like it's surprising
how phenomenal they're looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: My phone's vibrating here, but I don't
know why.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Angel, he's calling me up,
but I can't answer the phone because I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: on hashtag right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the plants look incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't had any rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's the same all the way
down there, but there's literally been
[SPEAKER_05]: like.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody else hear him?
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I the only one that his might go out?
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you hear me, everybody?
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_12]: Marcus, we can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Back.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, no, your audio cut in and cut
out again.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure what's going on, but we're
having some minor technical issues with
[SPEAKER_13]: bubble men.
[SPEAKER_13]: It comes in, it comes out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it goes off and then comes back
on.
[SPEAKER_13]: I cannot hear you at this time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think people can hear me for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an idea.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, they're popped in.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so they can hear me.
[SPEAKER_13]: You were popping in and out.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're going to have to do a bong
hit bong rip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty sure, yeah, yeah, he's he's going
out again.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody, yeah, you come in and go out.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, can I hear you?
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_13]: They can hear me markets, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're blaming.
[SPEAKER_13]: They say it's the beard of knowledge that
is causing the issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I got you back now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was me getting a call from
Stuntman Sam on Facebook Messenger,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that just completely took my AirPods
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: It completely took my ability to talk away
and hear any.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, sorry about that guy's little
technical difficulties there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking about.
Harvesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Stuff on your deck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, stuff on my deck.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, they look amazing, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look better than anything I've grown
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a big outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always kind of grew indoors,
but I gave these things a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of that was the many one sort of that
organic Earth juice type food.
[SPEAKER_05]: For maybe two or three feedings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never measured it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never pHed the water or the you know the
food afterwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kind of like the minimal amount and
then.
[SPEAKER_05]: I give been given it water for the last
like month, month and a half, and the
[SPEAKER_05]: resin production is absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's shockingly phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I wish the plants were bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, welcome Doctor Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey boys, how are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, not too bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got my audio and my my my my audio back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost it there for a second and was
talking into the into the ether.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had one of those moments in
awhile where I was like troubleshooting
[SPEAKER_05]: while we're completely live.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, that's like live television,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know how it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know how it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I've ever really done live
television.
[SPEAKER_07]: But well, this is this this this today's
version of live television.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Marcus, we've been living in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, true enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: And someone told me the other day that
we've been doing this for like eight
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that does that sound right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing this for eight years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I think it was 2015 when
Horatio first hit me up and said you need
[SPEAKER_07]: to come out and straighten out this Tony
Vizier guy who's talking all kinds of
[SPEAKER_07]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, I know from talking with you
on Facebook that you know what you're
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he wanted me to come into that
discussion guns blazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was like, no, I know, Tony.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had been out to Colorado once,
Mark, and it hung out with Tony because
[SPEAKER_07]: Pinsky made an introduction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think didn't we do a hash church
from Tony's?
[SPEAKER_07]: Place one time with Pinsky there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was definitely remember that AJ was
there, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Tony, AJ, me and Pinsky,
because me and Pinsky were rolling out
[SPEAKER_07]: West.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I do remember that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was that's going back.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rest in peace to Horatio for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I think about him, it makes me
a little sad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gone gone way too soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was instrumental.
[SPEAKER_07]: In introducing us, as you know,
I mean, I had developed an online kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: interaction with him kind of like on the
underside.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was it was before Facebook,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget how he had reached out to me,
but I think it was through some kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: Internet exchange on chemistry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unbelievable how fast time goes by.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, Josh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragonfire is medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see Colin also punching in here for
a little for a little Sunday morning hash
[SPEAKER_05]: church.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, maybe we're actually going to hear him
play music.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, in eight years, we have not
heard him play those keyboards.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: How goes the harvest, Josh?
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of background noise on my computer
for some reason, but it's going really
well.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going really well.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all really excited.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been probably the most amazing fall,
you know, in British Columbia that,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, let's say anyone can remember.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, this is our first chance at
really seeing what what strains do,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, up here without getting attacked
by butritus or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we live in the mountain valleys
and they easily get clogged up with
[SPEAKER_10]: moisture and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, spectacular year.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the flowers get to really express
themselves, show their flavors,
[SPEAKER_10]: show their colors.
[SPEAKER_10]: We made amazing seed this year.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're really excited to go to these new
gatherings that are happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: The next one's the Organic Cup in
Michigan, which Colin went to the one out
[SPEAKER_10]: in New York and told us a bit about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's happening in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're really excited to go out to
Michigan, meet up with the family.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some new DEM pure farmers out
there and in Maine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully a couple of them will join
us today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Connor Turp, Wizard and Hunter from Hidden
Forest up in Maine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully they join us today.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also going through harvest and
washing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I haven't started washing too much
hash yet from this year, but I'm really
[SPEAKER_10]: excited to get into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, things are really good up here
other than the bear and the deer,
[SPEAKER_10]: which we've already talked about.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've really done a number on our farm.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully it's been a good year of
learning about what the next season will
[SPEAKER_15]: bring for you guys on the genetic side and
just kind of paying attention to the
[SPEAKER_15]: things that are going on in the garden and
from plant form morphology to resistance
[SPEAKER_15]: and just understanding what the next
season will look like.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's always a nice preview into
the previous year's genetic genetics,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, so quite a bit with the heavy
rains that just ensued.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, luckily I started covering
things and really just making sure that at
[SPEAKER_15]: least the rain wasn't on top of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have heavy rain?
[SPEAKER_15]: Man, I was in California for it,
but apparently yesterday or the day before
[SPEAKER_15]: it was Thursday or something, it was like
all day.
[SPEAKER_15]: It just rained all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got six millimeters in like four
months.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the East Coast is just a different
world, but it just, you know, East Coast,
[SPEAKER_15]: man, we can have like 20 inches of rain
the last month of your crop and just it
[SPEAKER_15]: changes your world.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, so it's a very different
environment.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, everything could be going
perfect until August and September and
[SPEAKER_15]: then October rolls around and it's just
you get beat up, you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's really important to be proactive.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw on Brian's best friend, Farzin's
Instagram yesterday that they got four
[SPEAKER_10]: inches of rain in 24 hours.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, that's our whole,
and welcome Connor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'd love to hear from you in just
one second.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to say on the rain tip,
I mean, we have to prepare for Armageddon
[SPEAKER_10]: every fall type thing too.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we have seven different
greenhouses on our property.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all different styles.
[SPEAKER_10]: We sort of always keep the walls up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really the greenhouse is just a roof.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the springtime, it's walls and an end
wall and all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We get that early, but we don't even need
that early start because honestly starting
[SPEAKER_10]: in May or right in that and getting that
late spring window when it's really warm
[SPEAKER_10]: out, like the plants totally catch up.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get an incredible year.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there really isn't any need to rush it
early in the season.
[SPEAKER_10]: So really our greenhouses are mainly just
a roof.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're a roof just to keep acid rain off
the buds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding, but probably that too.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, and, and also just rain in
general, and then we have to be careful
[SPEAKER_10]: about humidity and just flow through
humidity.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's the one thing, you know,
that we, we really, we start our light
[SPEAKER_10]: depths June 1st or middle of June so that
we can at least have one good greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably going to do well by being,
being done in the middle of August,
[SPEAKER_10]: because by the end of August we can plan
on rain.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this year we did get rain in the end
of August.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a week's worth of rain in the end
of August here in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it did fuck with some plants,
but, and, and now honestly we've done so
[SPEAKER_10]: much soil building on our property over
the years.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is probably the first year we didn't
use any teas on any of our property
[SPEAKER_10]: because it was totally unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_10]: Plants had zero bugs, zero mold,
zero issues, no trellising.
[SPEAKER_10]: The odd plant got tall and heavy and fell
over during some winds, but we just put
[SPEAKER_10]: some bamboo in it and staked it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of our plants are just self,
they just hold themselves up, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: and, and we let them blow around all year.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they continue to be strong and it's
sweet for us.
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, that's that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But welcome Connor, Terp Wizard from
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing today, brother?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just trying to get some of my soil beds
tucked in for the winter and get
[SPEAKER_09]: everything prepped before it gets too cold
out here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a really nice season this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I picked some spots in the woods that are
a little bit more shady.
[SPEAKER_09]: So things started flowering sooner,
which means they ended sooner as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been really enjoying growing in
the woods compared to the yard.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and also Plant Magic Homestead is the
farm that you just certified, which is all
[SPEAKER_10]: the outdoor and all of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really enjoyed growing your genetics this
year, just by the way, we had a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: really good results from the, all of the
strains that we got from you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And even the GMO, which we told you in the
spring was the one, one of the one plants
[SPEAKER_10]: in the greenhouse that didn't get eaten by
mice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I don't know if you can put mice
resistant on the label, but it didn't get
[SPEAKER_10]: eaten by mice.
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The strawberry jelly, the, which I,
you can tell us the real names,
[SPEAKER_10]: but sometimes I just put the actual cross
on there because it's easier for me to see
[SPEAKER_10]: what the plant is while it's growing so
that I can vibe on, oh, this is a grape
[SPEAKER_10]: cream cake by banana OG, or this is a
strawberry pie by grape cream and then I
[SPEAKER_10]: just get the vibe on what the plant's
expressing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for making space in your garden for
the seeds that I made last last year.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys knocked out the park.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was super impressed with all the
expressions that it they brought out in
[SPEAKER_09]: your space.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's been fun to see people in
different microclimates grow it here in
[SPEAKER_09]: our state and as well as others and see
what expressions they're getting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just shows, you know, breeding under
the sun and growing it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get a little bit extra advantage when
the, the plants are made in the
[SPEAKER_09]: environment they'll be grown in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome by the way, Terp Wizard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we've ever met, but nice to
have you here on Hash Church and Josh
[SPEAKER_05]: spoke highly of you and yeah, it's good to
have you here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also got to say shout out to Wade
Laughter in the house and Stunk Man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sam, who both showed up here in the
last little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry for so many mistakes today,
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, I don't know what happened,
but somehow I must've started a different,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it can't speaking, but I can't hear
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can everyone hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: A conversation with somebody in his room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a, it freaked me out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had so many different glitches today
that emails aren't going, I somehow
[SPEAKER_05]: started a different zoom link than the
zoom link I sent to everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm dropping the ball a little
bit over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of ball dropping going on,
but we're all here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to see some new faces in the room.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also Hunter from Hidden Forest out in
Maine might jump on.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's also harvesting and doing some last
minute washes out there too.
[SPEAKER_10]: As well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully he jumps in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure what everyone wants to talk
about, but I know Connor, you were
[SPEAKER_10]: involved in the smoking jacket.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you go out to that, that event out in
California and then you visited some
[SPEAKER_10]: farms.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe tell us a little bit about the
entries at the smoking jacket,
[SPEAKER_10]: possibly if that sounds interesting to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was a really cool event to be a
part of.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never been or competed at a,
an event with that caliber of people from
[SPEAKER_09]: all over the US.
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually I only get the opportunity to
compete here in Michigan, if at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was nice to meet some of these
people who I've seen their work online.
[SPEAKER_09]: And man, it was hard choosing a winner out
of that box.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was interesting to see where most of
the profiles were leaning in that box.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of fruit, very little gas
from my nose.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemed like there's like a lot of
papaya and, and Skittles dominant profiles
[SPEAKER_09]: in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I don't get too many
opportunities to go out to California.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was a really great trip for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, spending half my trip
in LA and getting experienced that,
[SPEAKER_09]: and then going up North into the Humboldt
area and then into Southern Oregon and
[SPEAKER_09]: visiting Alpenglow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Cush Kirk.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a really magical trip to kind of
have the yin and the yang of the city and
[SPEAKER_09]: the forest all in one week.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I wish I had more time out
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, it was, it was a really magical
experience for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got lots of people shouting out in
the chat room, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: People, one guy says he's super looking
forward to linking up with you and at
[SPEAKER_05]: cream, Ashley next Saturday, sticky flower
farm says, yo, Connor, your Dalgona brown
[SPEAKER_05]: and Oklahoma smells like Welch's grape
soda.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a few others shouting me
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good to see you making, making some
waves in the turf scene.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's been really awesome to see all
these people who I sent seeds out to and
[SPEAKER_09]: got to meet over the last year,
make space in their garden for some seeds
[SPEAKER_09]: that I made in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't really consider myself a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of like, you know, working with the
hash plants that I have available and then
[SPEAKER_09]: finding a male that's interesting to me
and, you know, combining them and seeing
[SPEAKER_09]: what they do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, obviously there's certain traits
that I'd like, but I don't know if I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: quite as experienced as some other people
who would, you know, call themselves a
[SPEAKER_09]: breeder, you know, I kind of just say I'm
a my seed project.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm making seeds and I don't,
I don't know if I'm quite, quite ready for
[SPEAKER_09]: that, but yeah, it's been really sweet to
see everyone's results and to see what the
[SPEAKER_09]: male was bringing into the equation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I was pretty familiar with the
female stock of everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, it's been some stellar results.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are some of the varieties that you've
made this year?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I selected a male from Cooke Bush
Kirk's blueberry watermelon times melon
[SPEAKER_09]: bread.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I slapped it too.
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple different phenos of guava yogurt,
which is frozen Froyo times Lucy's
[SPEAKER_09]: diamonds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then pancakes from aficionado,
sugar coat from Schwale, choco cola and
[SPEAKER_09]: sour diesel from Skunk Tech, GMO,
which is a local cut.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like a couple GMO cuts floating
around Michigan.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I've got a creme de garpaya,
which was selected from JJ, Michigan
[SPEAKER_09]: regenerative farmers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of like a little Michigan
DEM collab.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's one or two more that I'm
drawing a blank on, but I've got like- The
[SPEAKER_08]: male that you used, is it alive?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, do you keep the male alive for the
next year?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm going to be selecting a male
probably from the F2 stock I made,
[SPEAKER_09]: and then just keep finding new males.
[SPEAKER_09]: I pop a lot of seeds, so I like to find
something that's interesting, that catches
[SPEAKER_09]: my eye and that has some lineage that is
more towards the half side.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I'll grow out some of the females,
see what the expressions I'm seeing from
[SPEAKER_09]: that and kind of hope that some of those
traits get transferred over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the reason I was mentioning that was
because, you know, you can take the male
[SPEAKER_08]: clone and with ethyl on, you can transform
it to a female.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you get a really good idea of
what terpenes and cannabinoids it has the
[SPEAKER_08]: ability to maybe pass on to a progeny.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot more sophisticated breeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the name of that compound that
you were saying, Sam?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's called ethyl on, but what it
is, it's ethylene gas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it's ethyl on is the
technical name on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I'll do is on Hashchurch,
I will post the name of the chemical and
[SPEAKER_08]: the name of the paper where they talk
about using it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's nice about it, unlike SDF,
which you can use to make a masculine
[SPEAKER_08]: female clones.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you do that well, that works very
good.
[SPEAKER_08]: You make all female crops, but this is not
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's the same thing that comes out of
bananas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to ripen that fruit
faster, you can put it in a paper bag with
[SPEAKER_08]: ripe bananas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this does the same thing,
but wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_08]: The male will turn female.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've showed Marcus photos of the
work before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it's not so good for form
because some of the male that gets
[SPEAKER_08]: transformed into a female, doesn't look
particularly female form.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has more of a masculine wispy form.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the flowers, the resin, the terpenes,
they all show up and you can get a really
[SPEAKER_08]: good idea of what it has the ability to
give from that female.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sam, is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like that's a diamond that you just
dropped.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is.
[SPEAKER_15]: My question to you, Sam, is that similar
to- You could smoke it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it like selfing, but with ethylene,
correct?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like selfing, except with selfing,
what you're doing is you're taking a
[SPEAKER_08]: female and making male pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: With this, you're taking a male and you're
making a female from it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's the reverse of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, amazing.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is a gem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's smokable unlike anything you've
done with STS.
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot smoke it.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, you can't even really handle STS.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_15]: For those that don't know, that is like
the sage wisdom was just cast upon us.
[SPEAKER_08]: What people have to do in the past was you
had to take a male, keep it alive for a
[SPEAKER_08]: few years as a clone, hit your ladies with
it, and then grow those seeds out and find
[SPEAKER_08]: out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was a several year process for you
to find out when you field tested the
[SPEAKER_08]: progeny seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, if you have 10 skunk number
one males, this will immediately show you
[SPEAKER_08]: which one has the most resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really, really points in the direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I first did this, because I had
been using my skunk male for maybe a
[SPEAKER_08]: decade or longer, then I tried this on it
and I was shocked and surprised how sweet
[SPEAKER_08]: the male was.
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, people are always saying,
oh, you bred the skunk out of skunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did it because I preferred the high,
the smells, the taste, the effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's my creation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I could do what I want.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I found out was that the male I
had been using for the last decade was
[SPEAKER_08]: even sweeter than the girl.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you'll find that out too,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a serious gem you just dropped
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you that want more
information on that, you would be implored
[SPEAKER_05]: to join the Facebook Hash Church group
because that's where Sam's going to post
[SPEAKER_05]: this information.
[SPEAKER_05]: And amazing that it like Sam has so much
information in his head that he can't just
[SPEAKER_05]: put it all out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to have conversations for now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think eight years for that to get
extracted.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you Terp Wizard for kind of
pulling that out of Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually when I'm sitting in my chair,
some of it sort of just leaks out my ear
[SPEAKER_08]: 24-7.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Josh inviting Terp Wizard in,
because it was really Terp Wizard who
[SPEAKER_05]: somehow pulled that out of you there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And man, I'm glad we did this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That right there was worth asking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if everyone understands how
fucking insane and profound that
[SPEAKER_05]: information was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure if you heard this,
what Sam just said, best friends,
[SPEAKER_05]: but if you didn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it's really, really important is
let's say you have 10 or 20 males of the
[SPEAKER_08]: same variety and you don't know which one
is the best one to use.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can either use them all or you can
actually pre-screen them using this,
[SPEAKER_08]: get it down to two or three, then use
those separately with your ladies and find
[SPEAKER_08]: out which truly is the best of the two or
three or if all three of them are good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I guess that's Hash Church,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_15]: The mic dropped.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be seven years from now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to be like, hey, do you
remember what Hash Church that was when
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam talked about that chemical that he put
on the bananas or something?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell me what number that was and
what time he said that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the chemical's name is epilon.
[SPEAKER_08]: But my memory is a piece of Swiss cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear what he was saying though,
Brian?
[SPEAKER_07]: About gender bending.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just got that without the 10 males
selected two to three, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: the top two to three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before that, he's turning males into
females to check their terpene and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: With this chemical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just say it one more time, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need this twice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically what it is, it's using epilon
and you spray it on a male just as you're
[SPEAKER_08]: going to begin to flower it and it will
turn female.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will produce, you know, 99% female
instead of male flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you didn't spray one particular area,
maybe you might get a few male flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then it allows you to test the,
with the gas chromatographer or whatever,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can test the terpene and the
cannabinoid profile and you get a really
[SPEAKER_08]: good idea of what that male can give as
part of the inheritance package that it's
[SPEAKER_08]: going to get.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Sam, you could potentially close that
male beforehand, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then have a few of those males around.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can't, you can't, it's only a
temporary transformation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't permanently change.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like if you use SDS, you know,
it's not a permanent transfer.
[SPEAKER_08]: The DNA hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: All that's changed is the sex expression,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, in the case of STS, you're
making a female produce male pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this case, you're using epilon to
produce a male that produces female
[SPEAKER_08]: flowers in expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can analyze it and see what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only that, but you can smoke it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's totally safe.
[SPEAKER_13]: So would you recommend that as opposed to,
we used to use gibberellic acid back in
[SPEAKER_13]: the day to turn the female to male?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that what you would use now?
[SPEAKER_08]: But the gibberellic acid again is female
to male.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm talking male to female.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a completely different picture.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, I understand.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just wondering if there was a
difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, gibberellic acid didn't even
particularly well turn females to male
[SPEAKER_08]: because it also made them stretch.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an elongation.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I did that with Ed, that's what had
happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: It causes a Just compared to STS.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a growth hormone.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, because I got turned on the
gibberellic acid because when I was
[SPEAKER_13]: working on bonsai, if you're trying to
elongate a particular branch for like a
[SPEAKER_13]: Chinese, you know, drop style or Japanese
cascading, et cetera, you would use that
[SPEAKER_13]: gibberellic acid.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's how I got turned on to it and
then started applying it.
[SPEAKER_13]: To cannabis, which we did get male pollen
from, but the stretching and elongation
[SPEAKER_13]: made it very challenging in smaller rooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a 20 foot tall greenhouse and I find
a gibberellic acid unmanageable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you usually use gibberellic acid
with colloidal silver if you're going to
[SPEAKER_10]: use it for sex?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't use colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_08]: I use STS.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's just, it's a toxic compound
where colloidal silver is not.
[SPEAKER_10]: So some people can still, they could use
colloidal silver if they want,
[SPEAKER_10]: because you can ingest colloidal silver in
your eyeballs and in your body.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I've never used colloidal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually we did about 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: We tried every different known method and
colloidal silver was one of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So was giliribic.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what we found out was that STS was
absolutely the best, the most reliable.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only problem is if you're going to
transform a female to male, you have to
[SPEAKER_08]: make sure that female doesn't have the
tendencies to express intersex because
[SPEAKER_08]: then, yeah, yeah, you enhance the
intersexness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just recently walked through a hem
field out in Kelowna and there is a
[SPEAKER_10]: licensed cultivar called umqua that's up
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And one more anyway, and it was,
it's feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we walked through the field and
there's probably like a good four or five
[SPEAKER_10]: different phenos in that field,
which I thought was sort of surprising.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't know if one of the methods of
feminizing is less stable than the other,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I thought with feminizing,
it would just be a little bit more stable
[SPEAKER_10]: than that, even though a lot of it was,
and it was actually a really sweet crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably what they were doing was using
poly multi-hybrids for either their male
[SPEAKER_08]: pollen source and transformed female to
male pollen source or their females.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you have poly hybrids and you
breed them they're poly hybrids,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to get multiple phenotypes,
which could either be an advantage or a
[SPEAKER_08]: disadvantage depending on what your
purpose is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people who cultivate want to get a
large crop of fairly identical stuff so
[SPEAKER_08]: that they can, you know, do the COD and
the analyzation and everything else as a
[SPEAKER_08]: package rather than each separate plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so Josh, you know, I grew a lot of
those varietals in the States here and I
[SPEAKER_15]: had a chance to do like suverase,
you know, a couple of different sours,
[SPEAKER_15]: the umqua, the lifter, a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I really noticed is what Sam just
said is that they're definitely using poly
[SPEAKER_15]: hybrids and even probably crossing those
poly hybrids with other groups of poly
[SPEAKER_15]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that in and of itself, when you looked
at the field is like different smells,
[SPEAKER_15]: different, you know, different structure,
different resistance, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: so it was really fun.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really fascinating to see that over
58 acres and just kind of like look at it
[SPEAKER_15]: and be like, okay, distinctively these
rows are the same, but they're also very
[SPEAKER_15]: different, you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: So like the turf profiles were,
you know, from lifter were like ranging
[SPEAKER_15]: from sour to gassy, you know, like it
just, you know, and the umqua was like
[SPEAKER_15]: very spicy and, you know, very,
just reminded me of older varietals from
[SPEAKER_15]: like the early 90s and late 80s.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the other handy things that you can
do with ethylon is you can use it to
[SPEAKER_08]: create a all male variety from seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first year you do, you make the
cross of a male and a female that have
[SPEAKER_08]: been a trend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the male was transformed to a female
and then you use a straight male on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: 25% of the seeds will be YY.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you select those when you'll have
to find which ones they are, because
[SPEAKER_08]: they're not all, then you can easily
produce crops which are 100% male,
[SPEAKER_08]: which most people, there's no use for
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for fiber, in theory, an all male crop
would be better because there would be no
[SPEAKER_08]: problems with the police because if
there's no female plants, then he don't
[SPEAKER_08]: have a problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they're all male, male fibers
actually finer, a little bit finer than
[SPEAKER_08]: female fiber.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it produces finer woven fabrics,
if you're interested in that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you recommend any kind of decorticator,
any kind of small sort of home style
[SPEAKER_10]: decorticator to where people could put
their hemp stalks in it and make the fiber
[SPEAKER_10]: and the herd, or they could take nettles
and nettles?
[SPEAKER_08]: How many plants?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've seen ones on Alibaba and
different things for, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: four or $5,000.
[SPEAKER_10]: So something like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And plant wise, I mean, I don't know,
I'm talking for the sustainable farmer
[SPEAKER_10]: where maybe you're doing an acre or three.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you need a real device.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just a toy because I've done it
by hand.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Gardella out of Italy makes larger
machines.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know domestically, there's only small
producers.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know John Lupien out of Oklahoma,
pardon me, out of Nebraska was making one
[SPEAKER_13]: because he took the old decorticators and
kind of made one that was towed.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I know that back in the day,
Gardella made the finest ones that you
[SPEAKER_13]: could just tow to a tractor.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it would basically separate the herds
from the wet fiber.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the wet fiber would just be hanging on
a rod and you could just pull that off and
[SPEAKER_13]: then dry it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are they still around, Sam, Gardella?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I haven't been keeping in
touch with the hemp industry the way I
[SPEAKER_08]: used to.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can't really say.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I've seen all kinds of
sophisticated French, Italian,
[SPEAKER_08]: Hungarian, et cetera, machining,
Czechoslovakian, Polish.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know which one is the best and
the most practical depending on your crop
[SPEAKER_08]: size, because also whether you're going to
do it like you say, fresh or dried,
[SPEAKER_08]: because traditionally it was done dried.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if you can do it with wet,
it might be faster and easier.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what he's talking about is the
redding, because back in the day,
[SPEAKER_13]: they used to field red, i.e.
[SPEAKER_13]: let it sit in the field and let the
bacteria eat the lignin off of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The problem with that would cause it to
turn gray.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of that Polish hemp would turn gray.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the French was gray.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the Italian was gray.
[SPEAKER_13]: In Europe, we would actually take large
baths, which they had large concrete
[SPEAKER_13]: baths, and they would soak them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we would water red it so that the
bacteria in the water slowly did that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that way, we kept the golden color of
the hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's how we did it by water redding,
whereas the Gardella machine, it pulls it
[SPEAKER_13]: off green.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you were able to dry that properly,
it should come out golden as well,
[SPEAKER_13]: because you're no longer dealing with the
bacteria eating the lignostic glues that
[SPEAKER_13]: hold the plant together externally.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry to nerd out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, I love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to also just put in Danny
and her father from the Colorado Hemp
[SPEAKER_10]: Project.
[SPEAKER_10]: They do a lot of amazing work out in
Colorado with industrializing,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, decortication and stuff and
fibers, and they do different things in
[SPEAKER_10]: the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've been meaning to get in touch with
her.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody is saying herd master,
H-U-R-D master, comes up on Google.
[SPEAKER_13]: Looks like they have some medium scale
offerings, somebody is saying,
[SPEAKER_13]: specifically Tony Neg in chat.
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, Tony.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a million dollars,
I know a lot of people don't have a
[SPEAKER_07]: million dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you do have a million dollars or if
you have a rich uncle who's got a million
[SPEAKER_07]: dollars, go look at a thing called the
Hemp Train.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hemp Train is very interesting machinery
that I think was actually a Canadian
[SPEAKER_07]: company at one time, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they were purchased by a wealthy
guy in Pennsylvania in Red Lion,
[SPEAKER_07]: PA.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know he's got one of those Hemp
Trains up and running.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah, basically fractionates the herd
from the fiber from what I guess is just
[SPEAKER_07]: like the biomass that's just ground into a
green powder, which could be extracted for
[SPEAKER_07]: CED and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of that fiber can be used for
plastics and different things like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I just like the Hemp Train.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want everyone to get on board.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hemp Train, like we all got on board.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Soul Train, remember the Soul Train in
the 70s?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone got on board and all these white
people started grooving to the music of
[SPEAKER_07]: Black America.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just became, yeah, this is
definitely the way to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the Hemp Train, everyone get on
board.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hemp Train, all aboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could be our new Don Cornelius.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a video meme of that the other day
where it said, when the cocaine was so
[SPEAKER_05]: pure, even white people could dance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had all these Soul Train whitey's
dancing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty hilarious.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Soul Train and roller skating
and we're getting into a whole new realm.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think really though, to just
interject for a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it really speaks to something called
the economy of scale, which is that if you
[SPEAKER_07]: could afford one of those big Hemp Train
type machines, those scale, then to run
[SPEAKER_07]: this, I mean, it's just the operating cost
of the plan itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't make sense to do hand
cortication on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: What does make sense is to have like a
processing center local to your farm where
[SPEAKER_07]: you could bring your stocks or they can
come and pick it up in a truck or
[SPEAKER_07]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then return to you the material after
it's been processed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because again, just to look at the,
it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they have a really interesting
video that describes the process and the
[SPEAKER_07]: overall mechanical feat of separating the
herd from the fiber.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sam, you probably have seen this at
industrial scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever you do something and it's just
that sort of like garage or basement
[SPEAKER_07]: scale, it's one thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you do stuff at really tremendous
scale, the power that's needed to turn
[SPEAKER_07]: those motors is really important to
consider.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just that they can do it a lot cheaper
down the street if you have that sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: investment to be able to put one of those.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the really old machines that I saw
they were run by steam.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it had like a small steam engine
attached to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was from the 1820s, 30s,
40s, 50s, something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I saw that just outside of,
it was at an Italian museum, a hemp museum
[SPEAKER_08]: outside of, shit, I can't remember the
name of the city.
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it true, Sam, that in the worldwide
market of hemp, and I don't know this
[SPEAKER_07]: because China is definitely a wild card
here, that all of that antiquated
[SPEAKER_07]: equipment is still producing the world's
bulk of what's consumed and what's used.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not talking about CBD in particular.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about mostly fiber,
seed, and oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all made up of very antiquated
assets.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's really only a few
countries that are even producing fiber,
[SPEAKER_08]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Marcus had a big early days of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you were like really heavily
involved in that stuff in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: Were you guys using large machinery at
that time to harvest that material for
[SPEAKER_15]: hemp?
[SPEAKER_05]: In 98, we had a hemp pageant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that's what we called it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we invited all these people over,
all these different people that had
[SPEAKER_05]: interest in the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember there was really wild,
like we were just a bunch of kind of young
[SPEAKER_05]: dudes from Winnipeg, kind of like,
yeah, let's do this hemp thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember these guys, the Hack
Brothers showed up because they were like
[SPEAKER_05]: owned diamond mines in Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were like, what brought them?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was this like billionaire guy
from Germany named Peter Steiner who had
[SPEAKER_05]: this piece of hemp metal that was like
lighter than aluminum, but stronger than
[SPEAKER_05]: titanium.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it could cut glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had been shipped around the world
eight or nine times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he brought it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I held it in my hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put an X into a glass ashtray because we
still had ashtrays at the hotels back
[SPEAKER_05]: then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we brought over a harvester from
Holland and we brought over the guy who
[SPEAKER_05]: basically ran it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we harvested about five to 10 acres at
our hemp pageant with all of these people
[SPEAKER_05]: present.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll never forget when he,
it had the two big red cutters in the
[SPEAKER_05]: front and he just ripped through this five
acre field.
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing was fast too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, it was Dutch made.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was, you know, it was definitely
like the Dutch definitely know how to farm
[SPEAKER_05]: and how to build equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it was pretty incredible machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never forget when they ran through
this five acre field, the pollen that came
[SPEAKER_05]: off of the field was like clouds of
pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd never seen anything like it before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people got really nervous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause they had allergies and they were
like, Oh my God, I'm, I'm going to die
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it didn't surprisingly set off many
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a few people that kind of had
to move away, but yeah, I have pictures of
[SPEAKER_05]: that somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really sure where those pictures
are, but I do have pictures of that
[SPEAKER_05]: harvester.
[SPEAKER_07]: How much did that, how much did that
harvester cost?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like would the average farmer who's
growing hemp today be able to afford this,
[SPEAKER_07]: this harvester?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was certainly not a cheap
machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might've been a quarter of a million
dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure today it would be five or six to
$700,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I, you know, don't quote me on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could have been a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could have been a little bit more back
then, but it was not a cheap piece of
[SPEAKER_05]: machinery, especially to bring over and
get to Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the work that it did of the hemp and
how fast it harvested the hemp,
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly wouldn't think anyone growing
under, you know, 500 to a thousand acres
[SPEAKER_05]: would, would be getting one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you could harvest very quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, it was profound for us because
we were just super young.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was like 19.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it would have been before 1998 because
I moved in 96.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it probably would have been 94,
95, maybe 95, 96 when we, when we had that
[SPEAKER_05]: done, we grew our, we grew our first field
in 95.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wouldn't have been 95.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was an experimental field.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was only one field grown before our
field and that was in 1974.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was by Jeff, Jeff Kime and Joe
Strobel, the tobacco farmer and the
[SPEAKER_05]: lawyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got the first ever license in Canada,
you know, in the last 73 years or whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: it had been since hemp had been grown in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were one of the five or six groups that
got our five acre experimental field the
[SPEAKER_05]: next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was pretty cool, kind of neat to be
a part of that history.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I'll never forget inviting
my mentor, Ron Hickey, who had served,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess at that point he had served six
and a half years in jail for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would end up serving another five plus
years in the federal penitentiary with
[SPEAKER_05]: mass murderers and rapists and psychopaths
for being a habitual florist, albeit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we brought him in my Volkswagen van to
our first five acre field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he definitely had tears in his eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never forget the, just the profound
revelation in his soul that was occurring,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and I'll never forget my
partner, Martin Moravsky.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure he was in the same position
as I was in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was watching him at the time either
saying, this is going to change the way
[SPEAKER_05]: people think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily the smoking of it,
but the driving down the highway and
[SPEAKER_05]: looking over here and seeing like a five,
five acres was the most any of us had ever
[SPEAKER_05]: seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ron grew a lot of cannabis,
but five acres just in one big field in
[SPEAKER_05]: 1995 was substantial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were surprised at the time because
it looked, it was buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like, it was, it was herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was, you know, at the time we
had convinced our minister of,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was minister of agriculture and
minister of finance that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp was a distant cousin of, of the
insidious marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really wasn't the same thing,
but once we grew it and we saw like,
[SPEAKER_05]: holy shit, this is definitely very close
to the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big stinky buds and, you know,
10 foot tall plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Marcus, there's that important
distinction that that's important 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and weren't you guys, wasn't this
group, the people who had kind of defined
[SPEAKER_07]: 0.3%?
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I remember correctly, I'm not sure
that this is true, but I thought it's
[SPEAKER_07]: because that was the limit to which they
could detect too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I said, okay, we can detect to this
limit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So therefore that will be the limit 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now look at the ramification that
that's had since, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the definition.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on a document.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was the peace treaty.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 1962 or whatever the peace treaty was
for, for growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, it was, I remember it was
Martin, I think that found it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was reading this very dry document and
it was like an amendment B and it said,
[SPEAKER_05]: if it's below 0.3%, it is deemed hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we had linked up with John Saul,
who was an expat.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went to the Amsterdam cannabis cup in
94.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess he thought it was going to be
some hemp gathering.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was living in the UK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ukraine and Kiev.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was with, you know, go to Barocco
from the Institute of Bath Fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We met this guy, John Saul in Amsterdam,
who was, who is living in Kiev and was
[SPEAKER_05]: connected to go to Barocco from the
Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I froze again.
[SPEAKER_15]: On this listening, you're all so amazing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you for reaching out and
continuing to be.
[SPEAKER_15]: Enthusiastic about the plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love you all.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a battery.
[SPEAKER_07]: Send me a battery.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll send you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I got you brother.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good one, Colin.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_13]: Marcus, you're frozen again.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're going to have to try it again.
[SPEAKER_13]: You met with Mr. Stahl and.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he hooked us up with these,
these farmers and, and go to Barocco at
[SPEAKER_05]: the Institute of Bath Fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess he had been breeding this Zola
Trinosha.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess he got told some years ago that if
he didn't get rid of THC, he had to get
[SPEAKER_05]: rid of hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he figured out some litmus tests in
the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm frozen again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Gentlemen, structure conspiracy theorists
websites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not, not meant to be shared.
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently.
[SPEAKER_13]: Another day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Another day.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Illuminati.
[SPEAKER_13]: Has said, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So really quickly, we got, we went to
Romania to look for CBD and hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably close to eight or nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: I forget what it was.
[SPEAKER_10]: We went to Bulgaria and Romania and drove
around and in the province of Mara
[SPEAKER_10]: Maramures.
[SPEAKER_10]: Outside of Transylvania.
[SPEAKER_10]: Up against the Ukraine border.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where we really found.
[SPEAKER_10]: Waddle fences and woven fences and all the
world.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, but also hemp here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold the cycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we found this incredible hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like a hundred years old.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a big long bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just, everyone made their own
clothes back in the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the elders that were in the
village even had like hemp shoes.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were like wearing hemp shoes.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like super, I mean, the,
the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[SPEAKER_10]: the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
the, the, the hemp shoes, pants and
[SPEAKER_10]: jackets.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were fucking sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is, it's like, it's heavy
fabric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super durable for being a hundred years
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would be so totally surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bag is even stitched up.
[SPEAKER_01]: With thread.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's even more coarse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the threading on it that they've
stitched the bag together outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: weaving is also hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is like incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easily going to last another many
more hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also soft and would be really warm.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they also grew flax because flax gives
you the, the soft linens in between the
[SPEAKER_10]: hemp and the skin, you know, you got the
under, under layers of flax, but also they
[SPEAKER_10]: had waddle and daub natural building.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of the walls were, you know,
posts and then you just weave in and out
[SPEAKER_10]: the, the thinner sticks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you pack it with, with,
uh, whatever you have.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the best thing that you can do,
if you're going to use like hemp Crete,
[SPEAKER_10]: or if you're going to use these small D
corticators, which we're talking about is
[SPEAKER_10]: you can use the herd, the inside part of
the hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you mix one third clay,
one third herd, and I like it that it's
[SPEAKER_10]: one third herd.
[SPEAKER_10]: You heard, and then, um, and then water,
you can mix it up in a, in a, in a
[SPEAKER_10]: concrete mixer, and then you can make
forms or you can just paste it up against
[SPEAKER_10]: the wall and clay herd and water makes
nearly like a concrete on your wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw buildings there that were fully
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't like anything coming off of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had been done hundreds of years
ago with this hemp Crete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And waddle fences and all of the buildings
were just really beautiful and really
[SPEAKER_01]: sturdy and fit right into the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think also when you're working with
that kind of natural building materials,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can even see like some of the
buildings or some of the homes even
[SPEAKER_01]: slumped with some of the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the earth slumped, the house would sort
of slump too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it wasn't linear and there
weren't straight angles and everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the house then sort of became part of
the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really beautiful, but yeah, incredibly
functional, maybe even a thousand years
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also they start, you started
realizing, oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: So instead of fence posts, they just plant
trees like willow, chestnut, apple trees,
[SPEAKER_10]: alder.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, and then the tree is what they
use a technique.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just cut it at height every fall.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then in the springtime, it sprouts up
a bunch of branches.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of times out in the west,
you're like, Oh Jesus, all these branches,
[SPEAKER_10]: we got to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's burn them.
[SPEAKER_10]: But out there, they're like, you know
what, we make them branch and then we cut
[SPEAKER_10]: them off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We cut the branches off and then we use
that for all of our weaving for our walls.
[SPEAKER_10]: We use that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We make rakes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd use waddle and we do raised beds,
waddle, waddle beds, waddle fencing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's spectacular.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's amazing way to live.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also when we were in Haiti, we went to
Haiti after the earthquake.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was two weeks after the earthquake
and it was just utter devastation,
[SPEAKER_10]: buildings down, dead bodies everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Terrible, terrible thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we started a birthing clinic and
to get food, we had to go in into the
[SPEAKER_10]: inside part of the island.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we started taking all these small
motorcycles into the inland and started
[SPEAKER_10]: going, Oh my God, there's all these houses
are still.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unaffected out here because they were all
waddle and dot.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were all woven houses, the fencing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it seems like, Oh, these are primitive
housing, but they didn't lose their house.
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't lose their crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: They had all the food, all the crops that
they had before the earthquake.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, sometimes the simple
methods, you know, are the smartest
[SPEAKER_10]: methods and get you through.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why simple homesteading can be a
really effective tool for everyone,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, to inspire one another.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: All this talk of hemp, I want to shout
out, uh, get Skoglund.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Rob Clark sent me this book recently,
the cannabis textiles book and,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, all sorts of cool pictures there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are harvesting hemp in Romania,
you know, Transylvania, really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really great information.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to go, uh, if you want to
learn more about hemp textiles,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is, uh, this is a cool book.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Victoria in Transylvania saying
hemp has always been growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's really great, uh, all the
different cultures that have been growing
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp and producing textiles are,
uh, are in this book.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would definitely suggest,
uh, stacking it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis textiles edited by Rob Clark too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some quite a few photos in here as
well by Rob.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's a great book.
[SPEAKER_13]: Highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also this amazing fabric from Hemp
Boutique.
[SPEAKER_10]: This incredible fabric from Turkey,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Amir.
[SPEAKER_10]: Marcus, Amir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amir and Rob.
[SPEAKER_10]: Amir and Rob Clark are doing this really
beautiful fabric textiles from Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nice that the pattern that you
see on that is not dyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the two different colors of hemp,
um, that are woven there naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really beautiful stuff for
sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: From hemp to hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say we, we made some really
good strains this year and I was going to
[SPEAKER_10]: name off a few just to get back into like,
uh, you know, strains and maybe we can
[SPEAKER_10]: hear some more, but, uh, from,
uh, from Kush Kirk, we got sour garlic,
[SPEAKER_10]: sour cream, ice cream, cake, lily,
papaya, sour garlic, and the sour diesel
[SPEAKER_10]: lemon.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we crossed that with, uh, the fire
glue guava punch that we made from last
[SPEAKER_10]: year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and we're really excited about that
because all the fire glue guava punches
[SPEAKER_10]: that we made this year are spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, they have a deep blue and purple
color going through them and they have,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, a grapey kind of essence to it,
but they also have some of that steely,
[SPEAKER_10]: chem doggy, chem flavors in there,
which we think are really, really
[SPEAKER_10]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, we also made some really good ones out
of the New Zellies gift that we have and
[SPEAKER_10]: the Hindu Kush and the royal purple and,
uh, this, uh, strawberry jelly again was
[SPEAKER_10]: really, really sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, with the Frenchies Forest we made last
year, we created that strain called
[SPEAKER_10]: Frenchies Forest in honor of Frenchie
dying and passing on to the next realm.
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked with Kimberly and we said,
Hey, Kimberly, we have this really
[SPEAKER_10]: beautiful strain that we made.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she, and she said, well, he was such a
force of nature that we just wanted to,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, we just, she, she, and we
decided to call it Frenchies Forest.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, it just, it's a very crystal-y,
uh, very florally, um, and it grows really
[SPEAKER_10]: resistantly to, um, uh, it has the guava
punch in it as well, uh, as some GAC
[SPEAKER_10]: variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think that it was the winner
in our garden this year, that Frenchies
[SPEAKER_01]: Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also, you know, when you put
intention like that into something,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we grew it for him, we crossed it for
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a really deep conversation with
Kimberly and OCN, um, his daughter,
[SPEAKER_01]: their daughter, and we wanted to call it
Frenchies Funk at first because it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we really got like all these
really funky flavors in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, you know, he was such a
force.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Frenchies Forest is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wow, you know, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put intention into something like that
and the plant really feels it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that plant is something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we'll be able to bring some
down and share with people and share
[SPEAKER_01]: across Canada too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: For those asking about, uh, the hemp from
Amir and Rob there, Hemp Boutique,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, bouquet.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I put the link up on the, uh,
in the, in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like terps.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you were trapped with one terpene on a
desert island, what terp would that be?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the combination of many terps and
thiles and esters and thiaways.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, uh, I'm not the, uh, the,
uh, uh, the monomolecular terpene guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I want, I want the, uh, the
combination.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like, I like so many of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love fruit.
[SPEAKER_13]: What would be the name of the flavor of
them all together combined?
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, the swamp water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take me back to when I was a little kid at
hockey practice and I'd go and get all the
[SPEAKER_05]: pops put into one cup, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I put, I want a little bit of all of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The swamp water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always thought, um,
mushrooms contain so many terpenes and try
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and to try to pull out all of the
different terpenes that like a mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: contains is quite complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always wondered if all of the
terpenes mixed together smelled like a
[SPEAKER_10]: mushroom kind of like all the colors
together or gray or brown or brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an interesting way of looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I love the variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that people have different
olfactorys and have different preferences
[SPEAKER_05]: and that they also have different
environments to grow things that tend to
[SPEAKER_05]: express things, you know, differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just love, I love the variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get asked all the time, Oh, if you had
one cultivar, what would you, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: what would it be?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if I had one cultivar, I'd for sure
get bored of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I will say, I think the one that
I had the longest that I didn't get bored
[SPEAKER_05]: of was probably the Rene, which was very
fruity and flavorful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, you know, it was like hot to get
you busted.
[SPEAKER_05]: It stunk so bad, so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just reached through the bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't feel the stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but when you burned it and exhaled,
it had a hazy smell to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it had these two varieties of this
fruity flavor that it tasted like,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it smelled like, but on the exhale,
if you exhaled a big puff of it,
[SPEAKER_05]: of bubble or whatever, and you walked out
of the room and you came back in,
[SPEAKER_05]: you'd swear someone was, was puffing haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I liked that, that it had these very,
very different groups, the two groups that
[SPEAKER_05]: I, that I probably prefer the most.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd never seen them kind of together,
uh, in a, in a way like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a special place in my heart for,
for Rene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Dr. Rene and shout out to
Mohammed who turned me onto the Rene way,
[SPEAKER_05]: way back when in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Much love to those guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is the Rene still around or has that been
bred into something else?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the great gardener was breeding it
into stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I've, I've heard people say
they have the Rene, but it's like the
[SPEAKER_05]: Romulan, you know, the Romulan was
short-lived.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone thinks they have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I used to get it from Romulan Joe
himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he got it from the group of guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't his cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just how he really became well-known.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a very special plant in the
nineties as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it, it just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was years later.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a cut from an overgrow guy that
white, I think his name was white rabbit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had this cultivar that was like a
cross of the Romulan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had that, it was, it's like the
Shishkeberry, you know, the Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can taste it in the Nicole.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can taste it in the Barbara.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely what makes those two
cultivars special.
[SPEAKER_05]: But do you see the pure Shishkeberry like
the yellow and the red line anymore?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: They seem to be things of the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's what builds that love,
that loss of not having it anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes it, makes you remember it even maybe
better than it really was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but, um, I do know that the
people are making just, just as good of
[SPEAKER_05]: things nowadays with the, with the new
cultivars that they're breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's always excitement in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things may come and go, but, uh,
there's always greatness around the next
[SPEAKER_05]: corner.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Romulan, unfortunately we lost it in a Bay
just due to white pottery mildew and
[SPEAKER_13]: champagne.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think also had Romulan and it same
problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of those just very bright,
expressive floral cultivars.
[SPEAKER_13]: But unfortunately, uh, nature and man
didn't necessarily combine too well on
[SPEAKER_13]: that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Brian.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a, I've got a Romulan BX four
going right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Three Finos.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've still got one outside.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really late.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually a Romulan BX four to a sour
best shit ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: And two of the Finos I'm learning what
they've only run once for a quick test.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now one of them's outside only and
brought back in all three to try again.
[SPEAKER_14]: But this one I have in the yard is really,
really unique.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I call it like a seven up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Soda type of smell on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know Romulan really well,
the pure ROM, but it, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: a couple of them come off like seven up
lime type of thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Influence, not sure where that comes from
or what the original Romulan tasted like
[SPEAKER_14]: really.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Piney to almost great be a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And most of my lime and the buds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Double covered in crystal.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the one thing you really got to
look for is just a ridiculous content.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that, that probably will just,
yeah, we, yeah, they're coded.
[SPEAKER_14]: This one's called candy coated from,
uh, catsu seeds on that one, actually.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, candy coated.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it looks trikey for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I had, I was going to say,
I tried this really unique, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: probably the best tasting resin out West
before I left that I couldn't place again
[SPEAKER_14]: or find it, the cultivar again,
but it was big sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy weed on a couldn't OG big sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy OG.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was like the most unique alien
spike ranges, you know, like Marcus is
[SPEAKER_14]: talking about on the XL, the Irene where
it came out hazy went in a different way.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that one was just this really like
reached a haze skunk pine, um,
[SPEAKER_14]: classic kind of, I guess later nineties
into early two thousands kind of thing
[SPEAKER_14]: with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Late nineties from the little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that realm, but yeah, big sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone knows where that we grew that
exact cross for a long time up here,
[SPEAKER_01]: we got it from down in Cali.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you got it from coastal seeds,
Michael, Michael Kagyu from coastal seeds
[SPEAKER_10]: in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Michael's probably still check him out.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It also has like, he just posted Maui.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: We, um, tie that big sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy weed because it is so resistant and
really heavy waiter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like yielded really heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was almost like anything that you
crossed it with would just be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really fun cross for us to have
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also Bobby and not grass family genetics
did more with that big sir.
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also the coastal haze they did
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: With the coastal haze and also the Puna
butter cookies, which is the big Island,
[SPEAKER_07]: South big Island, Puna, but, uh,
yeah, that, that, that bud was out on dead
[SPEAKER_07]: tour in the, in the early, early nineties.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, you know, my bag seed story
from a summer tour in 1891 was getting a
[SPEAKER_07]: bag from my friend Ron from Shasta.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey pizza man, Ron, how are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, we planted it like several years later
and the plants actually, they never looked
[SPEAKER_07]: healthy because for some reason they just
look just very strange.
[SPEAKER_07]: They grew right next to plants that looked
just fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those, those two seeds, the plants
were like, I don't know, just small runs
[SPEAKER_07]: to the litter and very purpley buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's lots of yellow and purple and
orange in there, but yeah, they were just
[SPEAKER_07]: big sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy is just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grateful dead approved.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they helped move it around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, they certainly did.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there was, I mean, I think we've
talked about a hash church.
[SPEAKER_07]: The influence that, and I think,
you know, Josh and Kelly, you guys got to
[SPEAKER_07]: agree, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The influence that the dead had in
bringing kind bud from, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: there was kind bud always in NorCal and
Oregon, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you think about it, that was like
the dead's home territory.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when they went out on tour,
all the hippies that followed them brought
[SPEAKER_07]: really good nugget and people were like in
some arena in, I don't know, Cincinnati in
[SPEAKER_07]: the seventies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all of a sudden it's like,
who stepped in dog shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, no, man, that's the way
weed smells when it's proper, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I remember like my friends,
well, a lot of people would go to the
[SPEAKER_07]: Grateful Dead shows by acid, by fucking
weed, bring back to their little
[SPEAKER_07]: community.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were like, oh man, you got that
from Dead Tour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go back on Dead Tour and get some
more.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure many a good bad seed was found.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also so much fun back then to just,
you know, when they were rolling around
[SPEAKER_07]: the country, it was like a traveling
circus.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would encourage people to look up on
YouTube, Grateful Dead parking lot videos
[SPEAKER_10]: from the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just look up parking lot videos from the
1980s and just watch people getting
[SPEAKER_10]: interviewed in the parking lot,
eighties and nineties.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you start realizing, whoa,
everyone's super stoked.
[SPEAKER_10]: They think they're on the tip of some like
absolute total great thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: All recycling, all national parks save the
environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it seemed like all food,
food, food, food, just progressive
[SPEAKER_10]: thinking art.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, different ways, ways of life was
mind blowing to people for me being bald
[SPEAKER_13]: headed kid that I was back in the day as a
punk, I would go down there and it'd be
[SPEAKER_13]: people just holding like six to 12 inch
mushroom, Amanita, mushrooms, mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some, some girls walking together,
one's holding a bucket and they're like
[SPEAKER_13]: goo balls, goo balls.
[SPEAKER_13]: You look in and there's just little hash
goo balls, swell of the waft of marijuana
[SPEAKER_13]: outside, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: On shakedown street.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then if you go inside, it was a
complete and utter fog inside,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Front and stage that kind of wafted back
because there were people who sat there
[SPEAKER_13]: and blew smoke at Jerry Garcia,
the entire freaking show.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was incredible what they did
regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have, they have not been given their
due for truly spreading kind, but
[SPEAKER_13]: nationally.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking, we're acknowledging that,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's weirdly still happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could definitely say, because it's
been so long ago, I'm so thankful if it
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't for Grateful Dead and Kind Bud and
being able to like move that around dead
[SPEAKER_01]: tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I wouldn't have made it through
university.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so thankful, you know, I have all
kinds of majors.
[SPEAKER_10]: It also wouldn't have taken her so long to
get through university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, eight years, three majors.
[SPEAKER_10]: She was on roller skates with fairy wings
and a fairy wand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a great front for Kind Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to get through anything and
anyone and it totally, and that's all that
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know people would say,
what do you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say it's Kind Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was getting it from all the Eugene
crew and bringing it out on tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, giving it out to
people who would come out to San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco, who were from New York and they
would pick it up from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we thought that we were
dealing big stuff when we had a half a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound and we were like, you know,
breaking up a half a pound of Kind Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would come all the way from New
York.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would affect the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just so different, so different
than the little brown manila envelopes
[SPEAKER_07]: full of seedy Mexican weed that you'd get
from like someone who'd be selling weed in
[SPEAKER_07]: New York City.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was easier, quite frankly,
to buy cocaine.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the reasons why cocaine's
popularity and crack took off in the 80s
[SPEAKER_07]: is because they didn't have good nugget.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think when the Grateful Dead started
reaching their echelon in the late 80s and
[SPEAKER_07]: good nugget came east, I think that helped
maybe with the crack epidemic,
[SPEAKER_07]: because it seemed like a lot of friends
that I knew just needed really,
[SPEAKER_07]: really much better weed than they were
smoking.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them went to coke and other
drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: But to be quite honest, I mean,
like even like if you were at like a Neil
[SPEAKER_07]: Young concert or like an Ahm Brothers
concert, you'd be hassled for smoking weed
[SPEAKER_07]: at the arena.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you had like just a little one
hitter, people would be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_07]: put that shit out, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to throw you out.
[SPEAKER_07]: With the dead, people would bring in bongs
and glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just an elaborate ceremony that
Bill Graham just paid off the promoters to
[SPEAKER_07]: say, look, this is the dead traveling
circus.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really peaceful.
[SPEAKER_07]: All they want to do is smoke weed and spin
as Jerry noodles.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think a lot of the other bands,
for some reason, it seems like didn't have
[SPEAKER_07]: that thing figured out.
[SPEAKER_10]: They also, you know, and the mushrooms are
known to help with addiction.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I mean, you can say,
oh, it was just a party in the parking
[SPEAKER_10]: lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, kind of.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it also affected your ways of thinking
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: What were you going to say, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was just going to say there was a
dark side of things, too, because because
[SPEAKER_05]: it was such an open circus, the police
really it was like shooting fish in a
[SPEAKER_05]: barrel.
[SPEAKER_05]: The amount of people that went to jail for
LSE and did 10 year sentences,
[SPEAKER_05]: the people that went to jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: People who got busted with weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just it was kind of like that
bummer of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when when people kind of hate on
cannabis becoming legal, which tons of
[SPEAKER_05]: that suck, there's all sorts of shitty
things about legal cannabis and an endless
[SPEAKER_05]: array of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's not on the list of legal cannabis
is 10 year prison sentences for getting
[SPEAKER_05]: caught with a bag of weed in Arkansas or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was that that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was more of the fish tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I that's the tour that I did
more of my time on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was very much the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never forget being in a show in
Montana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the police are up in the buildings on
on on walkie talkies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're looking down in the parking
lot and they're announcing to the
[SPEAKER_05]: undercover that are in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't I'm sure it existed during the
Grateful Dead days.
[SPEAKER_05]: But on fish tour, it would go free for
three.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they bust these poor kids and then they
get them to become narcs and go out and
[SPEAKER_05]: bust three more people, go find ecstasy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go find acid, go find whatever you
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get three people.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go free.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had a lot of friends end up end up
in jail during that time as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was this beautiful, amazing,
important thing that was happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was this real nasty
underbelly that I'm but I'm sure a guy
[SPEAKER_05]: like Jerry Garcia was conscious of and
probably, you know, it probably gave him
[SPEAKER_05]: nightmares.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea of how many of these young people
were getting locked up in prison really
[SPEAKER_05]: just for for trapping into this amazing
like the police just suck to hone in and
[SPEAKER_05]: be and to on the weakest on the most
vulnerable on the like just these like
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful, loving people that just wanted
to have fun and and get together and enjoy
[SPEAKER_05]: psychedelics and cannabis and amazing
music.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was that part of it as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was hard to talk about the other.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to look at it the way the police
do.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were soft, easy, targets,
and they weren't going to kill your mama,
[SPEAKER_08]: daddy and sister like the cartel would.
[SPEAKER_07]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to let you know, Marcus, I mean,
just to give you a report.
[SPEAKER_07]: So on a recent fish tour, this recent
tour, I mean, really incidents with police
[SPEAKER_07]: are kind of few and far between because
fish tour now is kind of like
[SPEAKER_07]: sophisticated audience.
[SPEAKER_07]: It costs a lot of money for tickets.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people, you know, they're kind of like
destination shows, like people plan their
[SPEAKER_07]: vacations around them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's travel plans that are being
made.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was one noticeable show this
past run of fish shows where there were a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of bus in the parking lot where
basically cops were going from car to
[SPEAKER_07]: cars.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are tailgating.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, like you said,
Marcus, this is like it's like our tribe.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to go go there, turn off the keys
to the ignition.
[SPEAKER_07]: We made it to the parking lot,
open a nice frothy beer, smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eat some food, socialize with some
friends, go check out Shake Down Street,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe have a balloon or two if that's what
suits you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, the cool thing is that,
again, most venues where places where fish
[SPEAKER_07]: plays these days, they got that figured
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, OK, fish is coming to town.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be this crazy group of
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to need to set up,
you know, and there's going to be campers.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be deep, fat,
fryers and falafels.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just it's just there's a whole
infrastructure that kind of organically
[SPEAKER_07]: comes together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's still so cool because like if
you're a teenager or like a college age
[SPEAKER_07]: kid and you got a couple of bucks in your
pocket, you could still go on tour and
[SPEAKER_07]: have like an adventure like you don't
know, like you might have like a couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: nights tickets lined up like you don't
have it all figured out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But because there's some uncertainty in
your future, it's kind of cool because you
[SPEAKER_07]: don't really know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll probably just end up going back
home and working the rest of the summer to
[SPEAKER_07]: pay your hotel bills.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I mean, it's like there's
nitrous mafia at all the shows now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So wherever you go, there's balloons just
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and it's just like, you know,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'll admit I like to do nitrous
every now and then.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I just think it's just
proliferated the scene to where it's just
[SPEAKER_07]: just garbage.
[SPEAKER_07]: They leave other balloons around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like a couple hours later,
you go down Seventh Avenue after Madison
[SPEAKER_07]: Square Garden is let out and there's just
balloon trash everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just a couple of guys down an
alley still stuck it on one balloon,
[SPEAKER_07]: like three guys stuck it on one balloon
because that's all that's left.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's kind of it's brought a
little trashy element to the scene.
[SPEAKER_07]: But all in all, I haven't really seen the
huge bus and organized bus that like the D
[SPEAKER_07]: .A.
[SPEAKER_07]: had a project called Dead End.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was in 91 or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they intentionally sent agents out on
the lot to almost get like information,
[SPEAKER_07]: like infiltrate, like try to be cool and
make a deal, but not necessarily bust
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody, but try to figure out like who
their plug is and try to figure shit out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had a very close friend of mine
who's our keyboard player in our band who
[SPEAKER_07]: went down on such a thing that it was just
it was horrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, yeah, it was just part of
Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: But a crazy time to be alive and following
the band around for the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the debting company are doing one
more tour totally next summer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody, everybody who's interested,
I did post that Ethelon at Hash Church and
[SPEAKER_08]: the article.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also posted it in the chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the people who are on Hash Church can
also see it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, you know, for us in
the late 80s, it's like everything is what
[SPEAKER_10]: you make it, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But for us, it was going to to dead shows
and seeing super natural people,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, living a nature life and then
going back home like to Oregon and then
[SPEAKER_10]: just studying mycology and studying
herbalism and just learning about
[SPEAKER_10]: midwifery and natural building.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know, going back to the dead
shows and bringing like tinctures and
[SPEAKER_10]: bringing medicines and products.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it really is, I feel like the origins
of like the legalization of cannabis came
[SPEAKER_10]: from those those areas and that from that
like sentiment and that like sharing of
[SPEAKER_10]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was like we were learning about
dosing and and making, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: medicated food at the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was I think pretty sophisticated,
even if you want to call it anecdotal or
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff that was just happening on the
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know that like with Rock Med and
first responder medicine, a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Kelly still does that stuff with with
professional athletes nowadays,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, with, you know, falling on jumps
and and everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, no, it's it's amazing how it's
it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also was the beginning of and yeah,
Marcus, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think whenever there's a really bright
spark of some kind of a beginnings of
[SPEAKER_01]: something, you know, it definitely shines
a light, makes people interested in what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that cannabis, you know,
is just that plant that continues to move
[SPEAKER_01]: us forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's continuing to move us forward
then, you know, and it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of things that we would
do illegally like to put ourselves at
[SPEAKER_01]: risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why is it that we continue to put
ourselves at risk for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew what the risks were at that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that I could look at 25 years
easily for what I was doing or lose my
[SPEAKER_01]: kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was still like there's some kind of
a relationship that you have with that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to continue to bring it forward and
that energy was on, you know, Grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in the fish lot or barter fairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it and it and it does plant a seed of
of some kind of collective consciousness
[SPEAKER_01]: of humanity for something to grow from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something very like deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't you know, I don't want to call it
spirituality or whatever, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something very essential about how
humanity exists with each other and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate with each other and then get
together and then, you know, spread that
[SPEAKER_01]: information and take something so
beautiful about it and take everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tour was that for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: This tour was that and Country Fair was
that Gordon Country Fair is not that
[SPEAKER_10]: anymore, but it was that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was the first time when we saw
Keith, you know, was it an Oregon Country
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair lineup waiting for food?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nineteen ninety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in line for some pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody earlier had said to me they had
two spray bottles and he said electric or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, well, I guess if
there's a choice and you know which one I
[SPEAKER_01]: chose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then later I'm in the lineup and this
guy said, oh, I've got something to share
[SPEAKER_01]: with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of this little velvet box and then
inside of another little box, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little silver box.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had this perfectly pressed keef like
square.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, maybe it was eighty nine anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made it, you know, and he pressed
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he shared it with us in line in the
pizza lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was probably in his sixties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, what is happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just remember talking on that key
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it changed my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet another, like, change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, what was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was back in the time we used to
think.
[SPEAKER_10]: It took all these hoses and contraptions
to make hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just didn't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: We just didn't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: We thought it was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Turns out it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was at the time for certain part
of your history.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam was probably puffing on the ninety
nine point nine nine nine back in eighty
[SPEAKER_05]: nine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, I was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was a year when did you you fell in love
with food and did food help you fall in
[SPEAKER_10]: love with hash?
[SPEAKER_10]: And do you find there's like a thing with
preparing high end food or to like
[SPEAKER_10]: preparing the hash and make and making the
hash and creating that space?
[SPEAKER_10]: Who?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think there's excuse me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was talking to the corner, but anyone
could answer it if they wanted.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, you know, I was talking to Connor
in that in that moment, because I know he
[SPEAKER_10]: loves the two of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think there's a lot of a crossover
between kitchen prep and hash prep.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's a.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there's a huge emphasis on being
cleanly in the kitchen, which is
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely a crossover for making hash,
you know, prepping your space and getting
[SPEAKER_09]: everything in order beforehand.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a French term called mise en
place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Place, which means everything in its
place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I kind of found hash right as my
culinary journey had started, and.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a lot of.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, bleed over from one to the
other.
[SPEAKER_09]: I find two with.
[SPEAKER_09]: My new hobby of beekeeping that there's a
lot of similar things as well,
[SPEAKER_09]: like you're sifting and using different
screens to separate your honey from your.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your wax, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's there's a lot of things that can
be similar to making hash in the culinary
[SPEAKER_09]: world.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree to argue with a couple of people
who believe that bees chased after
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis plants because that they want to
get ice to them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bees do not have cannabinoid receptors
unlike humans, so they they're not getting
[SPEAKER_08]: high from it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be a great food source for them,
but it's not getting them high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they seem to really love the male
ganja pollen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year had a pretty big male and every
single day they were going out to check
[SPEAKER_09]: out the new sites that opened.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not too many flowers that I can
compare to that will continuously release
[SPEAKER_09]: pollen over that long period.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure some fruit trees will or
something like that, but a lot of like the
[SPEAKER_09]: flowers kind of just have like that that
initial burst.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they get a couple more later,
but ganja seems to drop a lot of pollen
[SPEAKER_09]: over a decent amount of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've definitely noticed the connection
between hash makers after watching so many
[SPEAKER_05]: hash makers after helping kind of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many hash makers on their journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to say help create hash makers,
so they certainly didn't do that,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I helped inspire people to become hash
makers over the last 25 years or so,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I always found that the ones that had
traditional training in a kitchen that
[SPEAKER_05]: understood kitchen
[SPEAKER_05]: cleanliness seemed to shine in the hash
making processes, so lots of my friends
[SPEAKER_05]: that were really great chefs.
[SPEAKER_05]: To no surprise, we're also great at
producing nice hash and also seem to also
[SPEAKER_05]: grow beautiful cannabis, which is a very
important factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's great if you understand how
to make great hash, but if you don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: the material to make it, all the all the
recipes in the world are not going to
[SPEAKER_05]: produce any fire for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really have to first understand how
that sort of olfactory relationship,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I think, you know, ties into that
kitchen relationship where you have to
[SPEAKER_05]: have a very.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you have to have a high level of
awareness when it comes to your olfactory,
[SPEAKER_05]: your sense of taste, your sense of
visualization and your sense of creating
[SPEAKER_05]: synergistic creation with food.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way certain foods go together so
beautifully and doing certain things with
[SPEAKER_05]: those foods can create synergies that,
you know, produce more than one plus one
[SPEAKER_05]: plus one equals three, but one plus one
plus one equals nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, those those translate very
well, and I would implore anyone that's
[SPEAKER_05]: out there that is a chef and that is good
at what they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they enjoy cannabis, you should dip in
a little bit into hash making because
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll probably shine at it and like you
inspire people with your food,
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll also inspire people with your with
your extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to say this is next to
stoneliness.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to start organizing bio
regional DEM pure high end food and hash
[SPEAKER_10]: experiences that, you know, really nice
either high end Airbnb or some kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: piece of land or resort in different
areas.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we want to do is just combine the
hash with with food with glazes,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, with that olfactory experience,
not to get super ripped, but really just
[SPEAKER_10]: to super celebrate the the the aromatic
experience of really good food,
[SPEAKER_10]: fresh food from the area with awesome
people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then being able to offer some of the
products to the community that we might
[SPEAKER_10]: not be able to and we can do that in a
private session in areas like Maine,
[SPEAKER_10]: Michigan, Oregon, California, British
Columbia, you know, and if the borders
[SPEAKER_10]: open up, we can start hitting up South
America and Europe and, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe even Thailand if we if, you know,
it starts coming open because that's
[SPEAKER_10]: that's where they're open.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's yeah, that's where our families are
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: So look for those gatherings as we start
getting together.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're going to do DEM pure pop up
experience nights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Marcus, I have a question,
Marcus on the in the Whistler technology
[SPEAKER_07]: when you guys are making hash,
what does that come out analyzing at?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the reason why I'm asking is one
of the challenges here in Vermont is they
[SPEAKER_07]: have we are we've just gone recreational
or adult use or whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_07]: it, but they have a limit on THC,
which is we all know really stupid.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's an artificial limit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think with it, hopefully either be
raised or go away later.
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now it's 60 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is that around the ballpark that these
passes come out at?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, depending on what you're
putting in there, you can definitely get
[SPEAKER_05]: passes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, listen, I was running Afghan Kush,
Iran.
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I feel like I ran like 500 kilos of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we ran about 500 kilos of Afghan
Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: I froze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I back?
No.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, now I'm back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, it's a conspiracy again today.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were freshly frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you guys all freeze up for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know when I'm frozen because you guys
are all like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not moving, so I totally get that I'm
there it is again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, it doesn't want to give
me the love, doesn't want to give me the
[SPEAKER_05]: love.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 60 percent is right in the range.
[SPEAKER_05]: The highest stuff I made was close to 80,
the lowest it's come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is with like a 15 or 16 percent
cultivar was the 220, which is usually
[SPEAKER_05]: like you just throw it away and it was 50
percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can certainly make hash in that in
that 60 percent range.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're 73, 90 and 120 could be a
little higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm finding for these legal markets,
aside from California and some of the some
[SPEAKER_05]: of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: markets, is that because of the expensive
licensing and the expensive testing,
[SPEAKER_05]: people are mixing a lot of the microns
together, which really hurts my soul like
[SPEAKER_05]: badly.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that will also, you know, if you're
putting your 45 through 160 all together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most people now they're making bubble
to press in the rosin as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't they don't have that,
at least here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, 60 percent is a pretty solid
range.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those rosins are much higher than like in
the 70s or 80s, is that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the rosins come in around 65 to 80
or so, depending on the material.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you could always start with a much
lower frozen again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, I'm not frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I used to when I used to make ninety
nine point nine out of my skunk number
[SPEAKER_08]: one, which was 17 percent THC manicure,
so it wasn't enormously high.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just very terpene rich.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I would make ninety nine point
nine percent resin heads out of it,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was in the low 80s, like maybe eighty
two, eighty three, eighty four percent
[SPEAKER_08]: THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the terpene, the terpene
percentage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you know, I didn't measure it as a
percentage.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just did the profiles, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: So so so if it was 80 percent,
let's just say 80 percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think the makeup of that other
20 percent is in?
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't be surprised if the terpenes
were, you know, 10 percent or more,
[SPEAKER_08]: because even if they were only three or
something like that, what I've got there
[SPEAKER_08]: is four or five times stronger than the
weed came from.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the terpene should be also four or five
times higher.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wouldn't be surprised at all if a lot
of what was missing was terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, too, that was dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was also natural wax.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That might have been that other 10
percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it was 10 percent terpenes,
10 percent cuticle wax and 80 percent
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids, that's a pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabinoids was THC because skunk really
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: The amount of it's got THC, but really,
really, really tiny amounts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the same thing with CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's got a CBD synthase in it,
but it's mutated and it's non-functional.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it doesn't really produce CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: We produced rosin that was 84 percent
cannabinoids in 90 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: 9 percent terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that was in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it had like 77 percent THC-A and it
had some like 8 percent CBGA and it had a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit of CBC and almost 2 percent of
THC-VA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Marcus, if you add up all those numbers,
what's the total unknown?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 7 percent unknown.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's your wax.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you want to you get that number as
small as you possibly can and get your
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the dry sift and water hash will have
waxes on it unless it's been, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: treated winnerized.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but with winterization, also when in
that process where you you you dissolve it
[SPEAKER_07]: up in an ethanol and then to precipitate
out any fat splashes.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you strip off the ethanol,
you lose a fair fraction of the light
[SPEAKER_07]: fraction of your terpenes in that ethanol
recovery.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you grow them, you're losing
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you dry them, when you harvest them,
when you touch them, when you move them,
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's, yeah, that's the name of the
game.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're, you know, making rosin from
73 bags or isolating bags, making rosin
[SPEAKER_10]: from 90, if it's not, you know,
six star or seven star.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause me and Kelly are on that seven star
now, and we can talk about that later,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I'm just saying, um, uh, what do you
recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the whole,
[SPEAKER_08]: someone else may make rosin out of each of
the fractions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll see that the rosin the
difference will be less than the resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when you, when you've got a bunch
of different resins are a little bit
[SPEAKER_08]: different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, but the rosin it's, it sort of
equalizes everything and they all get
[SPEAKER_08]: really, really pretty high end.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just say that the more,
the more, um, uh, undesired, not
[SPEAKER_07]: undesirable, but the more, um,
uh, plant cuticle and plant matter and
[SPEAKER_07]: just the lower, or you're higher that,
that unknown fraction, the more Susan
[SPEAKER_07]: towards edibles and topicals and full
spectrum, not that there's no value in
[SPEAKER_07]: that full spectrum oil treatment,
you know, cancer patients who need AKA
[SPEAKER_07]: Rick Simpson oil, just full spectrum oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're getting, you know, a full spectrum
extract there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and people claim, I don't know,
I, you guys, I've seen this, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: these rosin gummies where I guess,
again, there's a fair amount of flavor
[SPEAKER_07]: from the rosin that actually goes into the
gummy that flavors the gummies.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe you're not, you're using less
sugar because it's, you know, you don't
[SPEAKER_07]: need to flavor it because you're using the
extract itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone experienced rosin gummies yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a bunch of rosin gummies
that are being made up and around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also using alternative,
like sweeteners, a lot of stevia people
[SPEAKER_01]: try, um, uh, Tamarind paste or a mango
pace, making some unbelievably gorgeous
[SPEAKER_01]: gummies with rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you definitely can taste the rosin in
there, but they're pairing it really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just, just a few weeks ago,
we had like a mango gummy that was paired
[SPEAKER_01]: with a beautiful rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the rosin heads chocolate out,
um, in Ontario has really good rosin
[SPEAKER_10]: flavor in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have their Buddha heads and all
kinds of different, you know, molds that
[SPEAKER_10]: are really, really sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys all, I mean, again,
I'm not, I, I'm a scientist, so I always
[SPEAKER_07]: like to try to figure things out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And whenever you're looking at the
marketplace, there's value for,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, considering, you know,
the way a consumer would think too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I always think that like in a
infused edible product, the best flavor is
[SPEAKER_07]: no flavor at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: You shouldn't, you shouldn't be able to
taste like the cannabis extract or all
[SPEAKER_07]: the, all the stuff that kind of comes
along for the ride.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is, you know, again, people use like
CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's not full spectrum,
but there are ways of basically
[SPEAKER_07]: translating full spectrum medicine into
ways where the taste and flavor isn't
[SPEAKER_07]: really impact, but neutralized by,
I think what you guys are saying,
[SPEAKER_07]: the other components in the formulation
itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you completely crossed from,
you know, uh, what, what is it
[SPEAKER_07]: recreational psychoactive consumption to
food and nutrition, because now you're
[SPEAKER_07]: really talking about a food and nutrition
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So where you could use these plant
extracts to say, okay, well, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: say, I don't know, I, I don't have time
to, uh, to, to do my dab or to smoke,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I do have time to say, eat this cliff
bar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, is there a, you know, again,
a way to put that rosin into something
[SPEAKER_07]: like a cliff bar or something that
somebody can eat on the go?
[SPEAKER_07]: A gummy is, I guess the most convenient
example, but you know, like I think you
[SPEAKER_07]: were saying is right, is that,
you know, gummies and I play around with
[SPEAKER_07]: melting lots of sugar in my kitchen too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sugar just as, yeah, I mean,
kind of like necessary evil maybe,
[SPEAKER_07]: but you know, everybody likes a jolly
launcher and these, this hard candy is
[SPEAKER_07]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can suck on it like a cough drop,
but, um, are, are, are there ways to
[SPEAKER_07]: approach using full spectrum extracts like
rosin, but even the more plantier extracts
[SPEAKER_07]: in food preparations where you're not
necessarily like, oh God, that's just so
[SPEAKER_07]: loaded with hemp or so loaded with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could, I could taste the can of butter
or I really, the best way of medicating is
[SPEAKER_07]: to pair it in a food that's complimentary
or somehow it doesn't mask the flavor,
[SPEAKER_07]: but uses its own flavor profile to put
like a bitterness or a sweetness or a
[SPEAKER_07]: sourness into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you guys think on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: My worry is the heating up of volatile
organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's, it seems like I'm sure
people have figured it out and there must
[SPEAKER_05]: be a way to, you know, translate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get that flavor and taste
unchanged, but I think if you're heating
[SPEAKER_05]: up chocolate or you're heating up,
you know, gummies and it's, it's quite a
[SPEAKER_05]: hot temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I worry that those things will be
changed, uh, particularly in their,
[SPEAKER_05]: in their flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sure someone will figure it out at
the very least.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just finish by saying maybe the
most prominent example of that would be
[SPEAKER_07]: like cough drop where cough drops
basically have, I think it's like camphor
[SPEAKER_07]: and a few of the kind of like menthol.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, menthol.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so like, yeah, so you could put
basically essential oils into basically a
[SPEAKER_07]: candy, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: A cough drop is candy, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you, as that cough drop
dissolves, you really feel that terpene
[SPEAKER_07]: rush in, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and I think with edibles,
again, correct me from wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe some people like the edible
to taste like herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want my herb tastes like herb,
but I want my, you know, edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want my food to taste like food.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need my food to taste like weed,
but I don't know, maybe other people feel
[SPEAKER_07]: differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can remember when I was younger,
the more potent the cannabis product,
[SPEAKER_08]: the more bite there was to my tongue,
almost like peppery.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I was, if I would eat herb,
dried herb, it would be a little bit spicy
[SPEAKER_08]: like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I would eat dried resin or dried sifted
resin, it would be quite peppery.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you did a butter or ghee extract of
that, it's got, I mean, peppery as hell to
[SPEAKER_08]: my tongue.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I smoked my first pure THC,
I assumed it was going to be peppery as
[SPEAKER_08]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I put a little tiny bit on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_08]: It had zero taste or smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's the karyophylline, because
karyophylline is one of the terpenes
[SPEAKER_07]: that's in black pepper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's one of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I haven't done any oral testing,
but I wouldn't be surprised if mersene,
[SPEAKER_08]: limelene, and several other ones also have
a bittery, peppery taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would not be surprised at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I put some on my tongue, but I just
haven't done it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a whole genre of cannabis chefs,
and a lot of people are using cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: preparations and cannabis extracts in
cooking.
[SPEAKER_07]: And kind of like the point that Marcus
raised, which is that if you're cooking,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're making like, I don't know,
a stew or a pudding or you're baking
[SPEAKER_07]: something, you're putting a thermal
pressure on this very sensitive plant
[SPEAKER_07]: material, especially when you're talking
about the terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And the terpene ratio, I mean,
everyone's tasted that roasted weed smell
[SPEAKER_07]: you get if you take just weed and put it
in the oven and try to decarb it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never understood that.
[SPEAKER_07]: As part of a brownie recipe, people were
like, oh, when you decarb the weed,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's much easier for the oil to extract
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you burn off all those terpenes,
and you have now this roasted weed smell,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is kind of like burnt terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also just the baking itself will
decarb it, so they're stupid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess the point I'm bringing up is
kind of like what Marcus was saying is
[SPEAKER_07]: that if you're using cannabis or cannabis
preparations in a food, a process to make
[SPEAKER_07]: a food product or a dish, and it involves
heat, it's going to either destroy or
[SPEAKER_07]: somehow rearrange the terpenes and make
like an off flavor in your food.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're thinking, well, you know,
again, kind of like what we were saying
[SPEAKER_07]: with Josh and Kelly, you're getting full
spectrum extract and you're getting
[SPEAKER_07]: everything that you can, the whole plant
goodness and everything that's in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what you're really getting is kind of
like a bunch of degradation products you
[SPEAKER_07]: got from adding this full spectrum
extract, which is not thermally stable,
[SPEAKER_07]: into a process where you basically,
yeah, turn it in.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had that problem, I would make no
baked cookies out of haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I get like half a pound of haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I would put a ghee on top of it
and put it over a double boiler and I
[SPEAKER_08]: would lose a lot of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I started doing was I did it
inside of a pressure cooker, not at higher
[SPEAKER_08]: temperatures, but just so that I didn't
lose anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that helped quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It changed the taste very slightly,
but I wasn't losing it like I was before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also know that when people are using
such a beautiful high, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: quality product such as rosin and it's
full spectrum, they're definitely doing
[SPEAKER_01]: raw products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the gummy that I'm talking about is a
raw product, because when you work with
[SPEAKER_01]: tapioca and you work with other different
types of binders like that, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely do raw products without heating
up and making sure that the raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, because remember the rosin is
being pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being heated up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on how high, you know,
they're heating it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's a low tap rosin, then it is
going to be THCA.
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually figured this out right here on
Ash Church a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is THCA that basically comes out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's through what we believe is somewhat
of a of a steam distillation process where
[SPEAKER_07]: the moisture is somehow driving the
cannabinoids out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so tapioca, you mentioned Kelly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had not previously worked with tapioca
and appreciated how viscous it is at room
[SPEAKER_07]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: You definitely need to heat tapioca to get
that to move.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an order of magnitude two or two more
viscous than just corn syrup.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it is just very, very viscous.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what what I also noticed is that if
you heat it up too much, it begins to do
[SPEAKER_07]: the this crystallization reaction,
which totally changes the morphology and
[SPEAKER_07]: the the the tapioca that you get out of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I use when I make my candy,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use nice, nice tapioca does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a time to cool down before it
actually gels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a time in between there that
it's actually really cool before it gels
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can add in your rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for sure, these gummies that I'm
talking about, they don't actually get you
[SPEAKER_01]: very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is definitely some THCA,
you know, in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that there's some possibilities
for tapioca to still have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: without overheating it or and it's
imaginable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want that a lot, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you going to say, Brian?
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you use raw agave that would actually
help with the viscosity of it and then
[SPEAKER_14]: something to bond it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we we use stevia and you can
also use a little bit of some super highly
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated fruit puree like you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mango is a puree that's often you can buy
and you can get it organic and is super
[SPEAKER_01]: thick and really concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same with tamarind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another one that's super thick and
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can add small amounts of tapioca to
it that's not actually very hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be nice to to look at,
you know, the lab studies on it because
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just something that, you know,
people are making around here in B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're delicious and really
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know the maker of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's doing some amazing work with
different types of shows to going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she's putting herbs in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been doing even some super
concentrated vinegar shrugs with different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the gummies like almost have like a
really beautiful flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: What a vinegar shrug is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A vinegar shrug is is just utilizing
vinegar instead of alcohol as a tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's called a shrug instead of a
tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're really quite flavorful and
quite wonderful if you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: do different compounded herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you you can cook down the vinegar
like a lot to where it has a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: a vinegary flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the gummies are almost like these
beautiful fruity wine gummies,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, those yummy wine gummies that
they I'm sure they still have them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't eat sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're delicious anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, just the whole anything slow cook,
slow heat, you know, the whole slow food
[SPEAKER_10]: movement.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's a great place for the for
the ganja.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, fermentation or pickling.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have something that's super spicy,
you know, you could add it to a spicy
[SPEAKER_10]: pickle or some kind of a little sweet side
dish.
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, it's maybe it's not your whole
meal, but it's just a little part of it,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, to get you kind of spiced up or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chutneys or something like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun to talk about, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that the more raw that we get.
[SPEAKER_10]: Any glaze, you know, could could also be a
good utilization.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pesto is a good one.
[SPEAKER_14]: The pesto is a really good one for like
raw even into cooked where it's that spicy
[SPEAKER_14]: element of the cannabis that burns your
throat even or does mine a bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that part can be unpleasant even if I
like the taste.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know when it goes in there with an
oil or either like the raw and the
[SPEAKER_14]: composition of it mixing and how it tastes
combined with like almost a piney nutty
[SPEAKER_14]: spicy pesto.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, savory.
[SPEAKER_14]: And not just sugary items where it's,
you know, it's fun to explore the turf and
[SPEAKER_14]: the expressions with food.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't I try not to eat sugar also.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's one of those when you do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you do that, you can make your pesto
instead of out of pine nut.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can make them out of cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it makes the pesto really creamy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you even blend it with hemp seeds,
it makes a beautiful pesto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I wanted to add even basil,
you know, fresh basil can have that super
[SPEAKER_01]: intense bite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found, you know, certain varietals that
actually, you know, are really hot in the
[SPEAKER_01]: back of the throat, too, when it's raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, those two are paired really well
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different kinds of chutneys, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working with like fresh lime
and fresh mint chutneys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And adding a little bit of flour in there
raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been it's really delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fire cider, a fire cider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's raw as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice ranges and ranges and profile where
you have like the spice to the savory
[SPEAKER_14]: texture and the sweets come in with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the spicy and the sweet idea with
chutney.
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds like a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been really fun putting the fresh
flowers in the raw honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you leave it in there for a good
month
[SPEAKER_01]: to make extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can use that honey raw in all
different types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that I give to
children for like a cough syrup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just getting THCA or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mostly use CBD in there, but they would
be getting THCA with those traces in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's awesome to use that honey for
different types of medicinal extracts.
[SPEAKER_10]: Honey extracted, other herbs, lavender in
honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can put all kinds of fresh
flowers in honey.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now you're just using this flavored
honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we did a Mendo breath raw honey with
raw roses in the honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, wow, totally incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys got a maple syrup?
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't done maple syrup yet,
and I'm really excited to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it would work because it would
probably erode the trichomes for sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're excited to try it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a Quebec sugar maple growing here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We also can get water from birch trees so
we can boil down birch as well to get
[SPEAKER_10]: syrup.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we have some Yakone that we grew
this summer.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can boil down Yakone to get syrup.
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are the three things that we
would like to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maple syrup would be a big thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The birch syrup would make a great soda,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would be cruel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be interested in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, come see us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a lot of maple syrup here in
Vermont.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I always wondered about the
interstate section between maple sugaring
[SPEAKER_07]: and cannabis and hemp and where those two
nutritional things come together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you mentioned, I mean, some people
are sugar adverse, so syrup is mostly
[SPEAKER_07]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I do see signs for sugar-free
syrup.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's a validate or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yakone syrup would be the best syrup for a
person that was sensitive to sugars.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a maple extract.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could basically make a synthetic
maple syrup by adding like a maple
[SPEAKER_07]: extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use that in our cooking all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an awesome organic maple extract
because I don't cook with sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always trying to think of different
things outside of the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some really beautiful maple
extracts that are made up here in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have all of the essences and it's really
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the sugars are extracted.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're making a can of butter in
general, maple syrup is a great little
[SPEAKER_07]: additive to add to give it a little punch
in.
[SPEAKER_07]: You end up seeing the water separate after
your butter cools, but it'll leave a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit of the maple essence back in
the butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the cool thing with the honey,
when you put the fresh flowers into the
[SPEAKER_01]: honey and then you extract it for a couple
of months, it would be the same as
[SPEAKER_01]: probably putting it into maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It extracts the waters from the fresh
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you don't have to use fresh flower,
but when you do use fresh flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: it locks in terpenes like amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you open up the honey jar,
it just smells like the fresh terpenes of
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower and honey.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but what happens is when the waters
are extracted into that, there's a tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of, and you've got to watch it,
of fermentation that might happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And personally, I think that is like so
delicious and really amazing, but there is
[SPEAKER_01]: like something that changes when those
extracted waters, yeah, go into the honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would think the same thing for the
maple syrup, but an incredible place to
[SPEAKER_01]: start dispersing and talking about the
acidic compounds of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: And using birch, you would get the
[SPEAKER_02]: birch soda.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what a birch does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bachelinus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Papyrus bachelinus, or anyway,
bachelinus, and then also piptophorus
[SPEAKER_10]: bachelinus, the mushrooms that grow on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, there's a lot of the, that you see
that name continuing to come up through
[SPEAKER_10]: the medicinal mushrooms as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the cambium layer, the pulsing waters
through the cambium layer.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the most healthy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why birches, why chaga is so powerful.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it has the most SODs, superoxide
dismutase, SOD.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a longevity enzyme and chaga has more
SODs than any other herb on earth.
[SPEAKER_10]: And one other thing that has a lot of SODs
is turtles.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're one thing that lives a long
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you find birch in the forest,
you'll see a whole entire tree decomposed
[SPEAKER_10]: on the inside, but the birch bark will
look nearly perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it was still growing because of that
SOD and that type of bachelinic acid is in
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So making tea from birch bark is super
powerful and potent for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just putting the bark into water and
boiling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not boiling, more steeping or simmering
and then steeping.
[SPEAKER_10]: Assuming people are herbalists and
understand what it takes to make
[SPEAKER_10]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Less temperature.
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, bark, even from other trees is
powerful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Larch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Healing from the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the twos, really, it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really different in flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the birch water, I think is
even sweeter than the sugar maple water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow it has some kind of a resonant,
like maybe it's like even a resinous
[SPEAKER_01]: sweetness that sticks with you that where
the sugar maple doesn't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is true that when you do any type
of tests on the triglycerides or all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the different polyphenols and things in
mushrooms, we find that the ones growing
[SPEAKER_01]: on birches have much higher medicinal
compounds than the ones growing on other
[SPEAKER_01]: trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you're starting to talk about
old growth, now we can't really
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily do those comparisons because
old growth has exponential healing
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But birch really is a winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one that's like in forestry,
they don't utilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't take care of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think it's a weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: They cut it down, burn it off.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's lame.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of areas in BC and in
Canada, and I know definitely in the
[SPEAKER_01]: eastern US where the boreal forest and the
fir forest hits the birch forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that area is just being degraded
because there's not a lot of value for the
[SPEAKER_01]: birch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we started putting value in the
mushrooms and we started putting value in
[SPEAKER_01]: the medicinal compounds of what's in the
forest, it would even outweigh monetarily
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're getting per board feed of
lumber sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just think that it's just not as
creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that there's no use for
lumber.
[SPEAKER_01]: There definitely is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just to see the forest as something
more than just board feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really could use more of that
creativity as a human species to upgrade
[SPEAKER_01]: us and our health and well-being because
there's so much intelligence in the forest
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, there's little lumps in the balsam
fir and in the spruce in the bark.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can push out the sap out of the bark
and collect all the sap.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's sap.
That pitch.
[SPEAKER_10]: That pitch is super useful in topicals,
warming it up, using that in your topicals
[SPEAKER_10]: and combining that with cannabis is really
good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also in the springtime, the trees
pollinate and they spoil and you'll see a
[SPEAKER_10]: whole entire forest just pollinating.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gathering pine pollen from the flowers in
the springtime is incredibly useful to
[SPEAKER_10]: just human health in general.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big up.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a red-velveted conch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beauty.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to bring up that it's
interesting here watching the sun grown
[SPEAKER_14]: full term.
[SPEAKER_14]: Plants that are matching the colors.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're obviously all polys, hybrids at
this point, but you can see a definite
[SPEAKER_14]: line between the later sativa,
more green with no purple even in the cold
[SPEAKER_14]: versus some of the really dark violet,
red, pink.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually funny.
[SPEAKER_14]: The drop leaves and the lower set leaves
go yellow and then fade up into an orangey
[SPEAKER_14]: red into violet.
[SPEAKER_14]: It actually matches the tree line in the
front.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of bringing up some interesting
thoughts about the sugar conversion that
[SPEAKER_14]: fits into the maple and the birch and how
this terroir, this region of the north all
[SPEAKER_14]: the way across the board where you guys
are up there talking about it over to here
[SPEAKER_14]: in Maine, which is big maple country here
to Vermont up into Quebec.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just kind of watching the sugars flow
high and then dip low in this really big
[SPEAKER_14]: binary spike and dip.
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems to have a lot to do with pushing
out smell bouquet for terpene.
[SPEAKER_14]: Loud, loud in the early morning when the
dew comes in and the dew points hit and
[SPEAKER_14]: it's just popping off its smell when it
goes to bed at night.
[SPEAKER_14]: It even seems like there's resin cluster
and shine with swelling that happens into
[SPEAKER_14]: those plants, those more colorful plants
this time of year.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to kind of throw that out
there as an interesting aspect where
[SPEAKER_14]: again, interesting in different regions
where the different strains can shine and
[SPEAKER_14]: such.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm definitely seeing better results
with the Indica based poly with some of
[SPEAKER_14]: the terpene profiles we talked about from
lemon.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now over to cherry showing even the cherry
brought in some cherry cam that has
[SPEAKER_14]: amazing resistance factor out here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Even tested some of the original cherry
cam sister to the brother to let go long
[SPEAKER_14]: and to now and even through storm every
thing I haven't seen any botrytis.
[SPEAKER_14]: It had a septuoria hit late, but not one
piece of botrytis yet on the on the whole
[SPEAKER_14]: row.
[SPEAKER_14]: So seeing some interesting stuff and then
some talk about this northern region for
[SPEAKER_14]: the sugar spiking and dipping into this
ripening period.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think once you build up the intelligence
in your soil and you start using that leaf
[SPEAKER_10]: from the forest and a lot of those inputs
from the forest in your beds and then you
[SPEAKER_10]: start doing more and more mulch in the
aisles in between your beds sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: connecting the forest and you and in the
end you do start getting that underground
[SPEAKER_10]: connection going on where they will
communicate with each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll even probably start transferring
sugars and even trace minerals back and
[SPEAKER_10]: forth to each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I think it's really valuable
mulching into the transition out of your
[SPEAKER_10]: garden so that you can get outside,
let's say outside the input into your
[SPEAKER_10]: garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the more indigenous layering and build
up you're doing the more you're building
[SPEAKER_10]: up that soil rhizosphere intelligence and
then the atmosphere and rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_10]: combination through the gaseous exchanges.
[SPEAKER_10]: They start building the cells and
everything to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I mean, that's that's what you
start getting when you build your land
[SPEAKER_10]: over and over like 10 years from now your
land will be even next year it'll be more.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what I mean is we're here for
16 summers now so it's been 16 years of
[SPEAKER_10]: building the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was actually really crazy this year
each year that we're building our soil
[SPEAKER_01]: more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know we haven't really been utilizing
teas anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only utilize teas on sort of our new
beds or on fruit trees because it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: over-nutrifying and the more that our beds
become mature we're just not really seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: any pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know we're still seeing the aphid,
that bong aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's around and about but with all of the
polyculture that we have around by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time the plants ready to harvest there's
not really any aphids on it at all maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: little bits here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw it maybe in our later season but
like it's amazing if you are seeing your
[SPEAKER_01]: farm or whatever your gardens as you know
a whole system not just when you walk into
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden that your garden is the system
but that your garden is the center part or
[SPEAKER_01]: part of a whole system then the whole
system helps take care of the garden and
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really awesome to definitely
know that the endophytic system of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ganja plants are just so full that the
allocation of any type of pathogen in
[SPEAKER_01]: there is almost like nil and that's been
pretty amazing to see and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely by bringing more and more
intelligence of the zone around us into
[SPEAKER_01]: our gardens rather than trying to create
something different in our gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just see what's around us and that's
why every garden should be different and
[SPEAKER_01]: we shouldn't all talk about the same exact
you know additions and techniques and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what we are starting to lean towards
is making big ferments right now in the
[SPEAKER_10]: fall as we harvest everything and then tee
in the mulch for the winter.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then we have this sort of recharge of
nutrients and green and sugars from the
[SPEAKER_10]: leaves and sugars from you know the die
off and also the most trace minerals and
[SPEAKER_10]: the most minerals that the plant or the
seeds and everything have in it you can
[SPEAKER_10]: make a big fermentation which we have
right now and then after we mulch
[SPEAKER_10]: everything we just do a really big tee
over it and then the snow comes or if we
[SPEAKER_10]: have some greenhouses that we keep covered
for the winter then we use sprinklers
[SPEAKER_10]: inside of the greenhouse to just keep it
really wet on the inside of the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_10]: so that the inside of the greenhouse can
sort of have that cleanliness of water
[SPEAKER_10]: happening in it and break down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wade did you have a hashed event last
weekend that you were involved in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes and hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah had a really wonderful gathering of
about 12 folks I think is how many folks
[SPEAKER_00]: came and yeah we got up to all kinds of
fun things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I wanted to show
you all is a piece of dry sift one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: local producers is going to be selling old
school dry sift solvent lists etc etc etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway he's very proud of it and he's old
school enough that his marketing thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a little gold leaf lightning
bolt on the pieces that come out and I
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like that because if you were
smoking hash back in the 70s and had
[SPEAKER_00]: access to good Afghani or Pakistani or it
often came with a seal on the plaque you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: get typically pressed in gold leaf and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway he's of that era as am I and I we
got into a fascinating conversation about
[SPEAKER_00]: hash and I raised my hand earlier because
I wanted to ask you all's opinion about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash that came back in the 60s and 70s
came from fields where male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grew together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the females were fertilized and
it's my experience with analytical testing
[SPEAKER_00]: when you look at the cannabinoid profiles
in cannabis that is seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's significantly different than that
same plant might have made were she
[SPEAKER_00]: sinsamia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really loved the hash that was
coming into this country back in the 60s
[SPEAKER_00]: and 70s and so I'm really wanting to throw
open a conversation and hear some expert
[SPEAKER_00]: opinions on the fact that most of the hash
that's available in the legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: market today is made from sinsamia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not made from fertilized females and
so it's different hash than what was
[SPEAKER_00]: happening back then and certainly we have
higher cannabinoid content in the hashish
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're enjoying these days but I just
wondered what the thinking from a panel of
[SPEAKER_00]: informed folk is on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences between the hash we have
today that comes you know really beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah last weekend I got very stung but and
I'm very stung today as well thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'm just wondering what's the opinion
here amongst this crew?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is you know there's a real difference
there and where do we want to take that
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got thank you for the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I'll have more to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I don't have a lot of experience
smoking hash that was made from male and
[SPEAKER_05]: female plants but what I do have is in the
last year or two when I came up with this
[SPEAKER_05]: hash hit product you know I'm so I'm like
Sam I'm just so used to like taking rocket
[SPEAKER_05]: ships to the moon like just puffing this
pure hash 60 to 80 percent it's high
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene content it's just this intense
blast and that's what I've loved and I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been almost blindingly loving it without
really paying attention to I don't smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: joints I don't smoke weed so what I found
out was when I started the the hash hit
[SPEAKER_05]: which was really you know the basis of the
idea was to create a product that would
[SPEAKER_05]: build a bridge for people who had no
paraphernalia other than a lighter they
[SPEAKER_05]: don't even roll joints they buy pre-rolled
joints and I wanted to build a product
[SPEAKER_05]: that allowed people to kind of have a
bridge over to hash and extract and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know it's just a little tube a little
paper tube it's got a little metal bowl
[SPEAKER_05]: with tiny little holes in it that we pack
a point two of a gram of hash into and of
[SPEAKER_05]: course right away I knew I wasn't going to
be able to pack full mouth passions this
[SPEAKER_05]: thing because the hash would melt and plug
these holes and you'd suck it into the
[SPEAKER_05]: tube so I had end-to-end as well turning
someone on who only smokes pre-rolled
[SPEAKER_05]: joints to hash the best product is not the
thing to turn them on to it's just it's
[SPEAKER_05]: too potent and it's not going to be the
experience that they're looking for so I
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of had to force my ego aside and
smoke you know what most people on this
[SPEAKER_05]: panel would call mediocre hash but what I
found was and I've learned this from
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking so many different you know people
ask me all the time do you prefer the
[SPEAKER_05]: torch and nail do you prefer the electric
nails do you like the puff coast do you
[SPEAKER_05]: like all these different things and or
vape pens or any of these things and what
[SPEAKER_05]: I found is as a cannabis lover that
there's a place for me to love those
[SPEAKER_05]: things at different times in different
places and so what I had to do with these
[SPEAKER_05]: hash hits was I had to start R&Ding them
and smoking them and I had to smoke hash
[SPEAKER_05]: of a non-melt quality and you know in a
couple of decades or whatever and so here
[SPEAKER_05]: I am now going for an electric skateboard
and pulling out a hash hit and and hitting
[SPEAKER_05]: and burning as well I hadn't burned in
like 15 years or something so what I did
[SPEAKER_05]: notice when I was able to put aside my
judgment on oh it's not melting and it
[SPEAKER_05]: tastes a little burnt and I don't like it
as much as I like this I just put all that
[SPEAKER_05]: aside what I did find was that I loved the
lack of intensity in the high it was
[SPEAKER_05]: almost like if it was a food metaphor all
I was doing was eating to be stuffed and
[SPEAKER_05]: for the first time now I was just eating a
small amount just to be like not
[SPEAKER_05]: completely satiated but like oh that was a
nice little treat like I'm not you know
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still present I'm not completely
blasted out of my skull not that getting
[SPEAKER_05]: blasted out of my skull you know put
limitations on me in any way I'm a bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: an anomaly like that as probably many of
the people on the panel are but what I
[SPEAKER_05]: found was I really enjoyed the the lack of
intensity of the high that I also had an
[SPEAKER_05]: appreciation for this for these subtle
nuances of the hash that I was now
[SPEAKER_05]: experiencing that I knew that this is what
these people that I built this product for
[SPEAKER_05]: were going to be experiencing they were
going to be able to instead of smoke a
[SPEAKER_05]: joint with paper and glue and plant matter
I could get them over the hash and they
[SPEAKER_05]: could smoke this this hash hit and have a
nice experience without the paper and the
[SPEAKER_05]: glue and the and the cannabis but have
that nice experience that's not that so
[SPEAKER_05]: many people have told me over the years
when I've given them a dab they're like I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't like that it's way too intense I'm
blasted out of my skull I just you know
[SPEAKER_05]: there's certain times that maybe that's
not what you want and there's lots of
[SPEAKER_05]: times where maybe that is what you want so
it was interesting from my perspective to
[SPEAKER_05]: remove myself from the bubble man way of
thinking and and smoke something that I've
[SPEAKER_05]: almost been judging harshly for the last
20 years and I gotta say Wade like there
[SPEAKER_05]: were times that I quite enjoyed it you
know when I'm out of my electric
[SPEAKER_05]: skateboard particularly with my son I
don't want to pull out my rig and all my
[SPEAKER_05]: gear and have a dab and then put it all
away and put it in the backpack and clean
[SPEAKER_05]: the banger and do all of this stuff but to
just pull a tube out and hit it like two
[SPEAKER_05]: or three times and then put it back in the
case and shut it up it really was a lovely
[SPEAKER_05]: subtle nuance and and I don't know if it's
because I'm getting older or if I was just
[SPEAKER_05]: able to put my ego aside for a short
period of time where you know we have to
[SPEAKER_05]: remember there's so many different
enjoyable aspects of cannabis and one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the things from my perspective that I've
always been trapped in is that I've you
[SPEAKER_05]: know not anymore as much but for a long
time I thought that you know the best was
[SPEAKER_05]: this and that everyone needed the best and
everyone should have the best but what I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: learning is is the best is what's best for
you and we should enjoy cannabis in all
[SPEAKER_05]: her glory whether it's smoking a pin or
joint or whether it's smoking some some
[SPEAKER_05]: dry stiffed single screen hash or whether
it's smoking some six star full melt hash
[SPEAKER_05]: so that's my piece that's what I have to
say and anyone else that wants to answer
[SPEAKER_08]: or Wade wants to reply now's your time if
you if it don't bubble it ain't worth the
[SPEAKER_13]: trouble well early I remember we didn't
have that in the in the early 90s or in
[SPEAKER_13]: late 80s so I mean I had access to at
times to quote-unquote Afghani hashish
[SPEAKER_13]: that was black to brown that did have a
gold seal on it but it is definitely I
[SPEAKER_13]: think Mojave stated as well that you know
the hash that we're seeing today is you
[SPEAKER_13]: know is made from all of these newer
genetics as well as opposed to you know
[SPEAKER_13]: they were all older land races as well
that we were ingesting and I agree they
[SPEAKER_13]: were both males and females they were
pollinated plants so I did not get
[SPEAKER_13]: sometimes as high smoking that hash I'd
always sprinkle it or break it down and
[SPEAKER_13]: put it on top of something you know to
just kind of add to it because of the
[SPEAKER_13]: nuances that it gave it gave a depth that
none of the cannabis that you had access
[SPEAKER_13]: to had because I think of the you know the
CBN and all of that that are you know
[SPEAKER_13]: inherent as depending on how it was sifted
but also it had a lot of impurities as
[SPEAKER_13]: well they were packing it with you know
wax lots of vegetable matter no seeds or
[SPEAKER_13]: anything like that but the quality you can
I mean it's like when you go to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_13]: okay right you'd go to Amsterdam for the
hash you don't go for the flower right so
[SPEAKER_13]: go sit there and you smoke a a temple ball
there in Amsterdam now take that same
[SPEAKER_13]: temple ball and go vaporize it it tastes
like hand it tastes like the essential
[SPEAKER_13]: oils it tastes like all of that
unfortunately that comes from the hand
[SPEAKER_13]: rolling etc etc so I think also by having
things like bubble man's bag sieving
[SPEAKER_13]: technology has better because remember
they used to used to use right you used to
[SPEAKER_13]: use particularly just one sieve right from
the books that I have sent from the the
[SPEAKER_13]: old book hashish etc they all tend to show
just one particular screen as opposed to a
[SPEAKER_13]: series of screens until you know later but
I sent this invite specifically to Mojave
[SPEAKER_13]: because Mojave is also a master of the
older hashish and understanding so Mojave
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm gonna defer and tap head to you
because love you love you too yeah I just
[SPEAKER_16]: came in at just the right time man I love
this conversation about traditional hash I
[SPEAKER_16]: think it's really important you know like
Marcus you're everyone like the average
[SPEAKER_16]: guy's just got a lighter that that idea I
just love the concept of like let's really
[SPEAKER_16]: think about who the consumer is because I
think we've really driven the market and
[SPEAKER_16]: the industry so much because we're so deep
into the science and the tech and but the
[SPEAKER_16]: average consumer just really needs us to
kind of like provide them with what they
[SPEAKER_16]: need in the simplest and most available
form and traditional hashish kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: really nailed that you know I mean they
really kind of came to this like middle
[SPEAKER_16]: ground of potency and portability and
stability and yeah there it is that's it
[SPEAKER_16]: man that's perfect give the people what
they need yeah but the other thing that I
[SPEAKER_07]: think is really interesting that I that
constantly ask Marcus question quick yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: please how much does that retail for
Marcus this is the five tubes are a gram
[SPEAKER_05]: and it retails for around like 24 bucks 25
bucks Canadian okay cool thank you I'm
[SPEAKER_16]: sorry Mojave no no problem man but the
other thing I just one thing I'd love to
[SPEAKER_16]: hear from from the group here that
constantly fascinates me about traditional
[SPEAKER_16]: hashish is the somewhat intentional
degradation of the whole plant profile
[SPEAKER_16]: before it was pressed in the aging process
and the drying in the sun and and not just
[SPEAKER_16]: with hashish with a lot of different
traditional cannabis cultures with you
[SPEAKER_16]: know malawi corn cobs and all these things
people did to like take this beautiful
[SPEAKER_16]: perfect plant that we're so desperately
trying to like achieve this whole plant
[SPEAKER_16]: full aromatic profile and destroyed a lot
of that because the way they ingested
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis was different for one they
ingested large amounts you know like when
[SPEAKER_16]: you think about hashish cultures like
Afghanistan I mean Sam obviously knows
[SPEAKER_16]: this better than anybody they filled that
bubbly bubbly with what an ounce half an
[SPEAKER_08]: ounce I mean from a few a few grams to
really yeah like an ounce when when we
[SPEAKER_08]: used to do it here in Amsterdam we we
would put in two or three grams sprinkled
[SPEAKER_08]: on top of the glowing coals and just keep
doing that we could do it for like an hour
[SPEAKER_08]: or two and yeah just keep making bong hit
those two or three grams was for each
[SPEAKER_08]: person to make
[SPEAKER_07]: they could do it better than me maybe
what's the what's the economics of a
[SPEAKER_07]: hubbly bubbly like so so Marcus was sort
of making a paradigm of you know just you
[SPEAKER_07]: know the average guy who wants to consume
or girl whoever you know just somebody
[SPEAKER_07]: with a match or somebody with a lighter I
mean now you need this hubbly bubbly thing
[SPEAKER_07]: and how much hash are you using in a
single sitting is it more than you have to
[SPEAKER_07]: spend for what Marcus was getting but we
were smoking it with large amounts of
[SPEAKER_08]: people so what did we smoke Marcus maybe
an ounce or two or three or four oh god
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure judging by the pale pale pale
color of everyone's face I would say that
[SPEAKER_05]: was the right right around there for
certain
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's also that's that's a culture of
growers you know that's a culture of hash
[SPEAKER_05]: movers and you know I remember when I was
moving cannabis I had pounds and pounds of
[SPEAKER_05]: free cannabis my friends that were growing
lots of cannabis always had pounds of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis so it's it's very different from
you know Joe Blow who's just like I'm not
[SPEAKER_05]: connected to this community I'm not
connected to this industry but I still
[SPEAKER_05]: want to have an experience with cannabis
and so you know they're very different
[SPEAKER_05]: things and there's very there's very
little pathways and bridges from the one
[SPEAKER_05]: to the other and so obviously you know
getting cannabis into legal stores here in
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada has opened that up people have
access to drinks and creams and all sorts
[SPEAKER_05]: of different things and you know they
don't know much better because it's
[SPEAKER_08]: actually fairly easy Marcus if you're
willing to dedicate your time and life and
[SPEAKER_08]: energy towards perfection of cannabis but
few people are willing to do that to be
[SPEAKER_05]: honest that's true and I think for us what
we want for cannabis is that you know I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't necessarily want everyone to do that
you know what I want everyone to do is
[SPEAKER_05]: have access to it as an option over just
alcohol that's what I want
[SPEAKER_05]: what I have said was I wanted people to
have people that don't dedicate their
[SPEAKER_05]: lives I want them to have access to
cannabis over just alcohol and so that's
[SPEAKER_05]: what this getting it into these stores and
still fighting this good fight and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know in Canada we can't have edibles over
10 milligrams and there's all these
[SPEAKER_05]: limitations still and it's you know I
think someone wrote I think it was Andrew
[SPEAKER_05]: D 'Angelo wrote on Twitter the other day
if grocery stores had to get expensive
[SPEAKER_05]: licenses and all the vendors had to have
super expensive licenses and you had to
[SPEAKER_05]: test rigorously we would probably all
starve in about three weeks you could add
[SPEAKER_10]: forestry to the list because the foresters
around here are able to have cops come and
[SPEAKER_10]: arrest the community to make sure they get
to do their job and it would be weird to
[SPEAKER_10]: think about having a cannabis farm which
is a life-saving herb farm to have like
[SPEAKER_10]: that kind of ability to go around and be
like hey these guys are growing weed
[SPEAKER_10]: around here you understand don't do
anything about it but I think that Mojave
[SPEAKER_10]: what you were talking about with different
cultures in the world and different ways
[SPEAKER_10]: of adjusting cannabis is it's probably you
know more than anything a microbial thing
[SPEAKER_10]: you know a microbial connection or it's
creating some kind of a different
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoid through its transformation
that's more bio available to them you know
[SPEAKER_10]: in their lifestyle or maybe it's because
it lasts longer you know three or four
[SPEAKER_10]: months down the road and that's when they
really need it so even though it may not
[SPEAKER_10]: be the best for the moment you know four
months down the road it's going to have
[SPEAKER_10]: preserved and still have been there for
them so I think there's a lot of different
[SPEAKER_10]: techniques that go into making the
extractions but I do believe that you know
[SPEAKER_10]: the traditional ways of making things are
worth keeping around because you know you
[SPEAKER_10]: get all heavy about new things and it's
fun to do that too but you know there's
[SPEAKER_10]: reasons why that whole plant traditional
medicine really was a better medicine for
[SPEAKER_10]: the the healing and stuff which is good
for us to remember and to keep that in our
[SPEAKER_10]: realm so we do we still do a good amount
of air drying and traditional hash making
[SPEAKER_10]: on on our farm personally but we also are
doing you know the new style we have a
[SPEAKER_10]: freeze dryer yeah we have a freeze dryer
and a press well I also just noticed that
[SPEAKER_16]: sorry uh no I also just noticed like what
what Marcus was saying earlier that you
[SPEAKER_16]: know I always I was always trying to make
full melt the most potent hash I could but
[SPEAKER_16]: I also found that I was like not smoking
it at every time that I would want to
[SPEAKER_16]: consume I'd kind of save it for the end of
the day or for like you know and it was
[SPEAKER_16]: maybe just a little bit too potent for
looking at spreadsheets and doing business
[SPEAKER_16]: stuff and kind of realized it just didn't
fit in my like daily life as well as kind
[SPEAKER_16]: of lower potency hash did just closer to
flour you know um so I've been smoking a
[SPEAKER_16]: lot of like 30 40 um hash that really just
it feels really good it might have a
[SPEAKER_16]: little sizzle to it but it's not full melt
by any stretch and just feels really good
[SPEAKER_16]: and it also keeps me so that I don't get
so down regulated so at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_16]: when everything is kind of eased and life
is chilled and the sun went down I can go
[SPEAKER_16]: and pull out that full melt and feel
better the full impact and it kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: gives me you know I feel that there's kind
of an arc to every day to if you are
[SPEAKER_16]: consuming cannabis throughout the day that
you want to keep it so you have so you can
[SPEAKER_16]: get high and so that you're functional and
I think hash really did that and I think
[SPEAKER_16]: that there's something also to just the
terpene cannabinoid ratio being different
[SPEAKER_16]: on on lower potency hash you know you
start to get terpene start to degrade and
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabinoids start to go up per per volume
that you're getting in your body so you
[SPEAKER_02]: get a really different effect that way
[SPEAKER_08]: well hobby but uh when you seed your crop
and you cut the terpenes in about half you
[SPEAKER_08]: cut you lower the cannabinoids also you
cut down the total yield of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_08]: and terpenes but you it really affects the
terpenes even stronger than the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids and I will say the way the
way the way it fits into the chain of
[SPEAKER_05]: custody here in Canada not sure if I'm
frozen probably yeah I'm not wow everyone
[SPEAKER_05]: else is okay great um the chain of custody
in Canada when you make an exceptional
[SPEAKER_05]: product and you keep it at minus 20
degrees Celsius and then you send it out
[SPEAKER_05]: to the to the government you know
warehouses and then to the stores they
[SPEAKER_05]: don't keep it cold and it's drastically
affected so the more traditional hashes
[SPEAKER_05]: are less effective in fact they tend to
almost get better with being at room
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature and aging a little bit whereas
like I put out beautiful rosas I put out a
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful 65 like four to five star hash
it was it was very light in color and it
[SPEAKER_05]: ended up like almost black after sitting
in a warehouse with 32 degrees Celsius in
[SPEAKER_05]: Toronto for three days because there was a
problem with the barcode you know there's
[SPEAKER_05]: in our country they're still I use the
metaphor they're still shipping spinach
[SPEAKER_05]: warm they don't have a cold supply chain
to move these products and when you make a
[SPEAKER_05]: specialized product like a high-end rosin
or a full mouth bubble it's very difficult
[SPEAKER_05]: to put it out into the into the world and
have the people experience it the way you
[SPEAKER_05]: put it out whereas these more traditional
hashes single screen hashes they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have that big of a degradation the
degradation isn't seen as a negative you
[SPEAKER_05]: know for hashes like that people want to
preserve them they want to keep them cold
[SPEAKER_05]: they certainly aren't curing them there's
no curing high-end hashes anymore there's
[SPEAKER_05]: just preserving them whereas with these
traditional hash methods they fit more
[SPEAKER_05]: into the current supply chain of you know
everyone not keeping it cold well also too
[SPEAKER_08]: when you press it you have a tendency to
rock it in place I mean you might squeeze
[SPEAKER_08]: out some of the smell up by the act of
pressing but you also it's more stabilized
[SPEAKER_08]: as a pressed piece than it is loose but
you and I know I know we both prefer loose
[SPEAKER_05]: resin yeah absolutely even the resin that
I'm putting into the hash it is is a loose
[SPEAKER_05]: resin it's not we tried you can put
pressed passion it burns very very
[SPEAKER_05]: differently it almost simmers which I'm
sure will eventually do you know because
[SPEAKER_05]: once again what you think is best for
everyone isn't it's just what's best for
[SPEAKER_05]: you and you really have to open your mind
and and and realize that there's a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: variety of people out there and for me in
Canada in particular I'm kind of done
[SPEAKER_05]: after 25 years of preaching to the choir I
want to turn some new people on and I know
[SPEAKER_05]: that I'm not going to turn them on with
you know like a 85 percent THC rosin that
[SPEAKER_05]: I made from you know live hash or whatever
that's great I want to still make that
[SPEAKER_05]: make it available as always but I also
want to turn on this big group of people
[SPEAKER_05]: that are completely different they don't
have the experience with it at all but I
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of want to move them away you know at
least have an experience of moving away
[SPEAKER_05]: from just smoking pre-rolled joints which
are not considered to be the highest
[SPEAKER_05]: quality cannabis in the first place it's
ground it's milled it ages poorly compared
[SPEAKER_05]: to ash especially in a cold warm supply
chain and so it's yeah it took a long time
[SPEAKER_08]: to sort of figure out that maybe what you
need is a metered puff go so they can get
[SPEAKER_08]: you know a vaporized small hit that's the
equivalent of 10 or 20 milligrams they're
[SPEAKER_05]: not gonna spend $500 on that they're gonna
spend 99 cents on this this is the tool
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to make work for them they all
have this this is what they have this is
[SPEAKER_05]: what we need this is what we need to
supply for them a product that they can oh
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a pipe I don't have a pipe I
don't know I can't smoke hash well here
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a hash hit give this a shot it's
just a tube you can puff it with a lighter
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can you can have that experience
and what I've found so far you know we did
[SPEAKER_05]: a great thing recently at North Shore
cannabis with the future of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: project London and all these great guys
they they were pushing the envelope they
[SPEAKER_05]: said let's set up a tent outside in the
parking lot and we'll have a little
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking session outside of this this legal
dispensary which is pushing the envelope
[SPEAKER_05]: for sure it's not really allowed although
most of us were medical patients smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: in an environment that was legal to smoke
in but we I met a woman she's not on
[SPEAKER_05]: social media she barely but you know she's
only buys pre-roll joints and she sat with
[SPEAKER_05]: us for a bit she said below I'll try your
your product or whatever she actually went
[SPEAKER_05]: and bought some bubble man hash and I just
gave her some hash hit too and she sat
[SPEAKER_05]: there and she just put a little dab in and
she she smoked it with a lighter she had a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of puffs and I just said you know
like what how how was that in comparison
[SPEAKER_05]: to smoking joints and she's like well it
definitely was a clearer high than I get
[SPEAKER_05]: from the joints and it was a little bit
stronger and it was just neat to hear her
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective of being like yeah this was
really nice it was like one puff I didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: have to smoke a whole joint sometimes the
joints don't taste that good and the hash
[SPEAKER_05]: tasted really good so you know one by one
if we help educate these people that
[SPEAKER_05]: aren't watching hash charts they're not on
social media and Instagram and looking at
[SPEAKER_05]: all the photos you kind of got to get out
into the world and I've said this before
[SPEAKER_05]: the importance of allowing us to gather
and smoke is so so very important the
[SPEAKER_05]: conversations I froze of course I froze
[SPEAKER_07]: of those sticks are in that one package 18
five five so so Marcus just for the
[SPEAKER_07]: uneducated user so do do each one of those
represents kind of like a joint so like
[SPEAKER_07]: one session right so it's five sessions
and you said it was $60 is that right $25
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's it's more than five sessions in
the sense it's uh I get about 10 rips from
[SPEAKER_05]: from this I get about 10 rips and people
who don't smoke very much get about 20 so
[SPEAKER_05]: you're getting between 50 and 100 pox out
of a pack for 25 bucks so it's it's pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: substantial you know 18 18 that that would
sell in the US wouldn't it those economics
[SPEAKER_13]: companies have had metered dosage
vaporizers unfortunately it just didn't
[SPEAKER_13]: catch on to people or I don't think the
the efficacy or the expandability was
[SPEAKER_13]: there but we had metered dosages back
prior to prior prop 64 I can't think of
[SPEAKER_08]: the exact word those vaporizers or with
the nebulizers they were vaporizers the
[SPEAKER_13]: problem is is that they were internalized
batteries so the batteries died depending
[SPEAKER_13]: on how long or the production because they
were made in pre they were not able to
[SPEAKER_13]: charge so there were technical realities
that were not necessarily expressive at
[SPEAKER_13]: the time which I think currently there are
because people were pushing for the latest
[SPEAKER_13]: in medical efficacy right so by having a
small handheld metered vaporizer it just
[SPEAKER_13]: didn't catch on with people because the
the the hit was so small for people they
[SPEAKER_13]: were used to a larger hit so I think it
was multiple things new to newer to market
[SPEAKER_13]: it was a state-of-the-art at the time but
unfortunately then we had when they would
[SPEAKER_13]: run out they were useless so people wanted
to then recycle them and we couldn't
[SPEAKER_13]: recycle the batteries because of the
component tree etc did you see nebulizers
[SPEAKER_13]: I have seen nebulizers we did not see them
sold to us yeah yeah that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: saying you need you need simple technology
a lighter yeah that's simple technology
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what this was designed for if
people don't want batteries things that
[SPEAKER_05]: are gonna fail they want to pull out their
lighter and have a little pop this is a
[SPEAKER_05]: specific group I'm talking about I'm not
talking about everyone by any means but
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what this product was designed for
and it's been well received in Canada and
[SPEAKER_05]: we're in the middle of making some deals
to bring it down to you know Washington
[SPEAKER_05]: and Oregon and California and
Massachusetts and Colorado and Nevada so
[SPEAKER_08]: there's there's there's deals on the table
do you print a label on them that says
[SPEAKER_08]: perfect for law enforcement and correction
officers absolutely hundred percent no 18
[SPEAKER_16]: made a good point as well about like
actual volume I think people really enjoy
[SPEAKER_16]: taking larger hits and feeling the full
inhalation and their lungs expansion and
[SPEAKER_16]: holding it for a second and having so even
lower potency cannabis I think would be
[SPEAKER_16]: really helpful for that just like instead
of down regulating yourself so you need to
[SPEAKER_16]: take more just have lower potency so
you're kind of at your threshold already
[SPEAKER_16]: and if you enjoy it not to create you know
addictive habits but people do like to do
[SPEAKER_16]: this and and I find like with hash it's
kind of nice when you can just keep
[SPEAKER_16]: packing the bowl and smoking big bowls and
taking the flower like these are
[SPEAKER_05]: repackable too you know they are they're
repackable like I've repacked one tube
[SPEAKER_05]: like four or five times if you like them
correctly they don't burn they don't like
[SPEAKER_05]: degrade like you know ideally you're not
going to smoke it forever but it's a nice
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of free I mean hash grams of hash are
already 20 to 25 dollars in Canada and the
[SPEAKER_05]: legal market so I thought let's come in at
the same price but like provide the vessel
[SPEAKER_05]: for smoking the hash out of and I think
that that you know convenience is the
[SPEAKER_05]: thing that we don't talk about too much in
that in the cannabis world you know we're
[SPEAKER_05]: like oh what about a puff coal what about
a measured dose what about a four thousand
[SPEAKER_05]: dollar banger with a ten thousand dollar
pipe a blowtorch and a dosist was the
[SPEAKER_13]: company I was trying to think of that had
done a meter dose of small pen that was
[SPEAKER_13]: specifically toward medical patients so
DOS IST if I were 18 if you had to guess
[SPEAKER_07]: what would that pack that Marcus showed us
retail for it at BPG it's it's five
[SPEAKER_05]: specific is it meter dosages it's not
metered in the point so it's not metered
[SPEAKER_05]: in the sense that you could smoke half of
it in three puffs or you could smoke
[SPEAKER_13]: one-tenth of it in one puff yeah 10 to 20
dollars retail depending you know if you
[SPEAKER_13]: know it's all on the amount of cannabis
and of course in the packaging but from
[SPEAKER_13]: the distributor etc depending on you know
manufacturing and cost I mean it could be
[SPEAKER_13]: 25 to 30 I don't know but you know what
are you selling for in Canadian you mute
[SPEAKER_13]: yourself mark 25 I think in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_05]: it would be 20 bucks 18 to 20 dollars u.s.
[SPEAKER_13]: 20 to 25 yeah that sounds about right and
people are looking for that they're
[SPEAKER_13]: looking for something that's specific
that's a an easier dosage they don't like
[SPEAKER_13]: having to buy a big cone and then having
to burn a little of it because as you know
[SPEAKER_13]: the flavors taste everything about it
really changes from the tars and
[SPEAKER_13]: everything that's internal so well and
looking for smaller dosage things it's
[SPEAKER_13]: again it's more that are medical specific
as opposed to the recreational just to
[SPEAKER_07]: clarify is it isn't a traditional to 18
that you know pre-rolls are kind of like
[SPEAKER_07]: the run of the litter it's just kind of
like the shake at the bottom you know
[SPEAKER_07]: after you've packaged up a bunch of stuff
it's basically what you know you can be
[SPEAKER_13]: that way if you're specifically doing it
the biggest problem that I want to say to
[SPEAKER_13]: every manufacturer out there is stop using
cones just stop it doesn't work you're all
[SPEAKER_13]: trying to to to cram too much stuff into
these cones whereas the most successful
[SPEAKER_13]: ones are people like connected that do it
straight cigarette style one but that are
[SPEAKER_13]: pre-made I think it's they granulated too
much what happens is the last inch an inch
[SPEAKER_13]: and a half it clogs up and it's useless
and you waste a gram to two grams of flour
[SPEAKER_13]: outright so I'm imploring every
manufacturer who makes cones stop just
[SPEAKER_13]: fuck off with it raw all of you I
understand you like it and it's easier for
[SPEAKER_13]: consumers but every manufacturers gotten
fucking lazy and what you're using is way
[SPEAKER_13]: too dry product that burns up way too
quickly you're not using proper product
[SPEAKER_13]: for your actual pre-rolls so please just
stop you're insulting us all you're doing
[SPEAKER_13]: it wrong and somebody out there like
connected and show them how to do it right
[SPEAKER_13]: because you're wasting it consumers time
you're wasting their money and you're
[SPEAKER_13]: pissing off new consumers who are like hey
I got a cone and they got oh I'm halfway
[SPEAKER_13]: so who's got a bowl fuck off with that
shit and fucking grow some real fucking
[SPEAKER_13]: pot and put it in your fucking cone I mean
in your actual joints and stop with the
[SPEAKER_13]: cones unless they're twice the size
because it's just gumming up way too much
[SPEAKER_13]: because the quality of flour is higher
than what it used to be and if you're
[SPEAKER_13]: putting resin in it you absolutely have to
stop with the coning so I'll get off my
[SPEAKER_13]: soap books now but all you cone making
motherfuckers fuck you go to hell I
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking hate you all save the cones for
the ice cream right but I can't what about
[SPEAKER_05]: what about the gold cone cones those are
the best aren't they the gold cone and
[SPEAKER_13]: they can fuck off with the gold cones too
sorry I hate to be so so adamantly
[SPEAKER_13]: passionate about my hate and vitriol for
them but I buy every single one that comes
[SPEAKER_13]: through BPG and I try them all I roll my
own even I use a machine that actually
[SPEAKER_13]: rolls them evenly so they exist okay
including that you can roll but
[SPEAKER_13]: manufacturers who are putting out these
products are absolutely crap they're too
[SPEAKER_13]: tightly packed and you're just turning off
consumers to a product that when I was in
[SPEAKER_13]: Amsterdam a decade ago plus they were
doing it right they were using cones but
[SPEAKER_13]: they were packing them properly you're
you're packing them way too tight and I've
[SPEAKER_13]: been to many different manufacturing
facilities and watched your people do it
[SPEAKER_13]: as they sit there with little tools to
pack and tamp that stuff down you're doing
[SPEAKER_13]: it wrong go back to how we used to roll
and roll them evenly across the board am I
[SPEAKER_13]: wrong here people
[SPEAKER_07]: you're absolutely right but I want to make
one notable exception which is and I'll
[SPEAKER_07]: point out to my friend Josh here on the
upper right the can of gar that I got in
[SPEAKER_07]: the teepee was the can of gar that changed
my life so other than yet rolling regular
[SPEAKER_07]: joints I'm totally with you ATN if they
look like a cigarette that's cool but the
[SPEAKER_07]: can of gar I think for the connoisseurs
kind of in a separate category that it's
[SPEAKER_07]: okay to be nice and big and obnoxiously
big well Collins were for sharing and
[SPEAKER_16]: people don't share nearly as much as they
used to you know COVID changed that and
[SPEAKER_16]: it's like the little point three dog
walkers are really popular because it's
[SPEAKER_16]: like I can go smoke it and put it out and
I don't have to hide a stinky thing and it
[SPEAKER_16]: tastes like shit if you fire it up again
you know so you know I know cones are a
[SPEAKER_16]: bummer and yeah it's it's a mess it's
crazy you know the the whole pre-roll
[SPEAKER_16]: packaged goods thing is just nuts you know
and and all the the the infused pre-rolls
[SPEAKER_16]: and stuff everyone's trying to to make a
better pre-roll but really it's all ATN's
[SPEAKER_16]: it's it's about it's just like cigarettes
cigarettes figured out like here's a
[SPEAKER_16]: standard form that every single cigarette
company adopted like overnight because the
[SPEAKER_16]: delivery system was just better and more
convenient and everyone government does it
[SPEAKER_13]: they send their actual joints out from a
Paul Maul equally rolled machine and guess
[SPEAKER_08]: what they burn evenly they're actually
rolled at a Solace laboratory facilities
[SPEAKER_08]: and they use a Banzack cigarette rolling
machine to do it I visited their facility
[SPEAKER_13]: there's an old high times article I think
from 78 that shows them actually doing it
[SPEAKER_05]: too it shows the machine one of those old
cigarette machines there's a company here
[SPEAKER_05]: in Canada called ready can that does it
with this cigarette rolling technology
[SPEAKER_05]: from the tobacco industry and they just
sold that company for like 900 million
[SPEAKER_10]: dollars there's a good amount of small
batch farmers I'm seeing now with little
[SPEAKER_10]: glass tip straight pre-rolls and things
that are really nice looking and and then
[SPEAKER_10]: some infused and all that and so I'm
starting to see that and I agree with you
[SPEAKER_10]: that you know an evenly rolled and a
thicker joint brings more flavor and it
[SPEAKER_10]: allows the resin to kind of caramelize and
burn on itself as it's burning through and
[SPEAKER_10]: really it should be getting better as it's
going down to the bottom rather than
[SPEAKER_10]: getting hot and and more packed in and
stuff so yeah maybe it's like heads up to
[SPEAKER_10]: Futurola and all the different rolling
companies out there that are you know
[SPEAKER_10]: really giving people these as options
because I think people would start taking
[SPEAKER_13]: the option they're not giving you an
option that's the problem is that you're
[SPEAKER_13]: only dealt cones you go to raw and
everything else I just saw today they even
[SPEAKER_13]: made an actual little raw a cone roller
attachment that goes on your key chain so
[SPEAKER_13]: you can roll a nice little tight joint and
can perpetuate this bullshit so sorry I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: just my anger don't dump on the cantigars
continue to make those products John that
[SPEAKER_07]: cantigar that you gave me at the at the
teepee when I met when I met I brought
[SPEAKER_07]: that to DelFest the Bluegrass Festival I
think a year later and changed a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: people's worlds with that single device so
thank you I totally yeah big up to you and
[SPEAKER_10]: big up to the makers out there and that's
that's what's up you know and you remember
[SPEAKER_10]: that cantigar right oh yeah definitely
yeah for sure it was spectacular
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely what is it with the cantigar
itself so it's actually using leaves the
[SPEAKER_10]: leaf the sun leaf and and then also often
you know adding a lot of rosin and bubble
[SPEAKER_10]: hash to the inside and then having like a
stick on the inside so you know the
[SPEAKER_10]: chances you know a lot of those things can
be you know have an ounce of hash inside
[SPEAKER_07]: of them as well as I mean it burns so
slowly unlike just like a fatty like if we
[SPEAKER_07]: had a fatty the same size the fatty would
have been gone an hour ago that thing took
[SPEAKER_07]: about seriously about two hours to burn
and I shared it down at a pit right in
[SPEAKER_07]: front of Del McCurry's band playing up
there and there he could just see those
[SPEAKER_10]: clouds wafting up there that looks good
with the disco ball too because it gives
[SPEAKER_10]: the lights going and everything so I'm
sure it was much appreciated in the crowd
[SPEAKER_07]: that's sweet cantigar producers please
keep those movies coming the people who
[SPEAKER_07]: like those I mean I think it's a different
product than just a joint if you will or
[SPEAKER_07]: just more fatty or something I have to say
though I do love still rolling my own and
[SPEAKER_07]: I still love the idea of putting two
papers together and making even what we
[SPEAKER_07]: used to call ungrateful dead tour a fatty
right so when you light a fatty it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: like lighting that nail cigarette because
you light a fatty it's like whoa man that
[SPEAKER_16]: fucking thing just and you draw have you
guys seen the perfect pre-rolls perfect
[SPEAKER_16]: brand pre-rolls that Michael Bacchus works
with they're they're pretty far out the
[SPEAKER_16]: the one thing that's really cool about
them is they have two filters on either
[SPEAKER_16]: side a filter on either side so the
concept is that you can snap it right down
[SPEAKER_16]: the middle and share it or you can cut one
filter off and have a full one gram joint
[SPEAKER_16]: to yourself it's just it's just a silly
little idea and the funny thing is he came
[SPEAKER_16]: over to our facility in LA a couple years
ago just as like a just like hey I just
[SPEAKER_16]: rolled this up just for us to share and he
cut it and I was like dude that's a
[SPEAKER_16]: product no one's done that I mean it's
silly and weird but it's a total product
[SPEAKER_16]: and there really has an interest in
infusion technology so they the flower
[SPEAKER_16]: actually does stay the terpene profile
actually lasts a lot longer and it's not
[SPEAKER_16]: just dumping a bunch of extract in there
it's pretty interesting that as far as
[SPEAKER_16]: pre-rolls that's one company that's done
something different
[SPEAKER_16]: perfect perfect yeah yeah yeah they do
they do pre-rolls and they do flour like
[SPEAKER_16]: like blended or I don't know if it's all
blended but it's um might be single
[SPEAKER_16]: variety but um it's uh loose so it's
broken up loose flour in a jar for people
[SPEAKER_16]: to roll joints or pack bowls it's another
one of these things of like everything
[SPEAKER_16]: that we do and we engage the flour so much
we engage the product so much but there's
[SPEAKER_16]: a lot of there's a lot involved and maybe
people just don't want to be that involved
[SPEAKER_16]: or can't be that involved can't take the
time to crumble up or get stinky hands and
[SPEAKER_16]: go back to work and be scrutinized or
something so they make a product where
[SPEAKER_16]: it's like just loose um flour it's really
interesting it's mohabi we all know only
[SPEAKER_10]: god is perfect that's the atheist the one
high thanks everyone I want to show
[SPEAKER_10]: appreciation and acknowledgement and love
to all you and everyone in the crowd we're
[SPEAKER_10]: going to take off for the day it's been a
