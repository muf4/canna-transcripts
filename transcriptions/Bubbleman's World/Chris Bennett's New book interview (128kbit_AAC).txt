[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, welcome to Bone Man's world
everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with Chris Bennett.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would I even introduce Chris?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to introduce Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been on Hash Church enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys know him as the cannabis
historian.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been writing books about cannabis,
delving into the occult connections with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has written another amazing book here.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the title?
[SPEAKER_04]: Lieber 420, Cannabis and Magical Herbs and
the Occult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Serious, serious thick book.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, Kitty?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Kitty?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 800 pages of madness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana madness and magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: What number is this for books for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my fourth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, two co-authored books and this is my
second personally authored book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this obviously has taken you a serious
amount of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been compiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking earlier, a little off
camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your cat is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking a little bit earlier off
camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: In regards to, you know, sort of how Chris
has been able to, from writing his other
[SPEAKER_04]: books, been able to finally compile and
create these connections that he's found
[SPEAKER_04]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, one thing leads to another
and having a background with different
[SPEAKER_03]: cultures and their historical use of
cannabis helps to understand later
[SPEAKER_03]: references and how they came about and
stuff like, say for instance, Islamic
[SPEAKER_03]: influence has really influenced later
European use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see this in things like magic
via like magical texts, like the 10th
[SPEAKER_03]: century, Gayat al-Hakim, which refers to
cannabis and then was translated into the
[SPEAKER_03]: Picatrix in the 13th century when it was
translated into Latin and entered Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of the pivotal documents of
Western magical traditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of starts with this, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has a recipe, for instance,
for a pound and a bit of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis resin mixed with stag blood and
other ingredients burnt in order to invoke
[SPEAKER_03]: the messenger of the moon in the pillar of
smoke that forms over this fuming pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, that's one way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another way is in alchemy,
you know, figures like Abba Siena and
[SPEAKER_03]: Geber, well-known Arabic alchemical
figures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before them, Zozimoz, all made
reference to cannabis preparations and
[SPEAKER_03]: tinctures and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why we find these sorts of
references in the works of European
[SPEAKER_03]: alchemists like Pera Kelsis and Cardano,
who have recipes for cannabis infusions in
[SPEAKER_03]: their works in the Latin again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, you know, so we don't have
having a knowledge in this kind of helps
[SPEAKER_03]: to bring all this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we got phones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they ring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes the cat stares at the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes, you know, all these different
things are happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's very unique information that
you've got.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not read the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris was just telling me you're the only
person to be able to interview me that
[SPEAKER_04]: hasn't read the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's pretty new.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty new.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just came out April 20th.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, it comes out on the
actually in 1918, April 20th.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aleister Crowley and a guy who I learned
while I was writing this book actually
[SPEAKER_03]: lived on my street here in North Vancouver
in Deep Cove.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I grew up in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a cannabis ritual.
[SPEAKER_03]: And funny that comes out on the centennial
anniversary of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out centennial anniversary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, definitely I can tell you if you
guys are going to pick up this book and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to read this information,
it's not going to be information that is
[SPEAKER_04]: common knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I feel like I know a fair bit
about cannabis over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've definitely dwelled into it geeked
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Chris's information is always stuff
that's a surprise to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always new.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I don't always know all the
names.
[SPEAKER_04]: But over the years, he's definitely
educated me to Rabelais and to Crowley and
[SPEAKER_04]: to some of these different guys'
connections with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm always looking more forward to
sort of connecting more of the dots as
[SPEAKER_04]: he's done through, you know, 11 and 12 and
13th.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the different centuries that this
information has passed through.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's incredible, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I'm lucky to live in this
like pivotal time when things like Google
[SPEAKER_03]: Books, where they've scanned like all
these medieval and Renaissance era
[SPEAKER_03]: manuscripts into Google Books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can search through them or word
searches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis in Latin is spelled the same
way as it is in English.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're able to go back into a lot of
these variations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you know other spellings,
the variations of it as well, you're able
[SPEAKER_03]: to search all these documents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's just a matter of finding out
what the references say where you're
[SPEAKER_03]: finding the identification of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I know some Latin translators and
hired some Latin translators and was able
[SPEAKER_03]: to find a lot of really cool old recipes
and information that nobody's ever really
[SPEAKER_03]: written about for centuries, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty fun stuff and pretty
interesting as well if you like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of got to give it up to some of
these old alchemists from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really had to seek this shit out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were they were they were doing a lot
of experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like a guy like Paracelsus,
for instance, his recipe for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcanum, which is a tincture preparation
was for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see all these people getting
treated for epilepsy now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like, you know, like 15th century,
16th century.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he's already, you know,
well aware of medicinal qualities of this
[SPEAKER_03]: herb for that particular debilitating
purpose, you know, is being used.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to wonder how many how many tens
of thousands of people have suffered
[SPEAKER_04]: between the 15th century when he came up
with that information to today,
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's like, you know, it took Sanjay
Gupta or whatever going on CNN and being
[SPEAKER_04]: like, oh, I was wrong about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is it's it's, you know,
and it's a lot of it is children
[SPEAKER_04]: suffering, you know, and not not I guess
we always feel that children suffering is
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously a little bit worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: But suffering is suffering.
[SPEAKER_04]: People suffering is kind of a pretty big
downer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, in the aging world to
treat people of something like epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was compared to exercising with a
demon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say they must have thought
they were possessed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Epilepsy was thought to be demonic
possession well into medieval Renaissance
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, you were it was like a miracle
cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you've exercised a demon right
out of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, interesting that off camera before
we were talking, I was sort of talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about how I feel that cannabis is this
sort of weather metaphorical or whether
[SPEAKER_04]: you want to think of it as exactly that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tends to close these, you know,
metaphorically, I this is my own personal
[SPEAKER_04]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: That it seems to close these portholes in
which demons possess people and whether
[SPEAKER_04]: that's, you know, people thinking bad
thoughts, people doing bad actions,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, people getting hammered or
drugged out on different drugs where they
[SPEAKER_04]: don't seem to be themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the medicinal components of
cannabis helping regulate and getting
[SPEAKER_04]: people's biological functions back in
order getting their endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_04]: into homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That really would be the opposite of,
you know, the demonic possession of
[SPEAKER_04]: epilepsy and all these other elements.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's funny because in the
ancient world a lot predating germ theory,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was this whole theory about
different demons that were present.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could see if they were present by
different ailments and symptoms and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you, you know, had a cough or
the rash on your groin and blah,
[SPEAKER_03]: blah, you had this particular demon,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's scary.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was, but it kind of followed along
the same lines as germ theory of like
[SPEAKER_03]: contagion and symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going back fairly far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's going back like thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we're going to hit the puff call
while we talk a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris's book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're actually going to head out
on the boosted boards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps the evolve will make a,
uh, an appearance.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're going to do the Seawall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seawall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I was saying to Mark earlier,
I'm only doing interviews about the book
[SPEAKER_03]: that people read and eat and read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you electric skateboard and you
want to go for it, you can rip on an
[SPEAKER_03]: electric skateboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I can bypass that particular rule if
it go for a ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: So well, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will absolutely read your book,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, you know, for me, there's an
enormous amount of information here that I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, like you learning from
writing, writing your books and connecting
[SPEAKER_04]: things and putting the dots together to be
able to see these different patterns.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to that as well,
you know, so it's going to take obviously
[SPEAKER_04]: reading the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, this is not light reading.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is seriously heavy reading like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You definitely have to, uh, kind of turn
up the intellect a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, it's like, I'm out to
prove stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like takes references and
citations and footnotes and bibliographies
[SPEAKER_03]: and makes for a slightly dryer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I try to keep it entertaining
with weird facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like a great book, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some of the highlights that
you've, uh, that you enjoyed the most?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I love the stuff about the
Templars.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's been claims by a number
of authors like Robert Anton Wilson and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, a doctor wrote a book about medieval
medicine and, uh, no, no, no, no,
[SPEAKER_03]: no.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somewhere I think his name is,
um, and, uh, um, numbers of books about
[SPEAKER_03]: aloe vera have it as well that the
Templars had this, uh, cannabis wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a preparation of cannabis aloe in
a palm wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started digging around trying to
find that and I could find no references
[SPEAKER_03]: to it, but I did find that, uh,
cannabis was seized at, uh, two Templar
[SPEAKER_03]: sites and their raids, considerable
amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The form isn't described.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, they had some sort of a contract
with Saracens Arabs to grow cannabis for
[SPEAKER_03]: them in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was one particularly known for
growing the industrial varieties of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what year, what year?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like 12th, 13th century.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so, uh, um, it adds credence to
these, these claims about the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis wine and also a Pope who was
friendly with the Templars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Templars were around for a few centuries
and before they were accused of their
[SPEAKER_03]: heresies, uh, um, they were quite friendly
with, they were part of the Catholic
[SPEAKER_03]: church basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, a Pope who was friendly with
them released a medical treatise that
[SPEAKER_03]: included a cannabis infused wine for a
number of, uh, ailments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the same time period, uh,
uh, Mason, Villier de Hanekort,
[SPEAKER_03]: his Masonic journey, he spent time in the
Holy land and it had a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: illustrations of, uh, of different,
uh, uh, masonry techniques, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: from the Holy land.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the only page of written text in it is
a cannabis infused wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems likely that there was some,
you know, uh, awareness of that type of
[SPEAKER_03]: preparation coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, there's this interesting
connection that the Templars are very
[SPEAKER_03]: connected to the whole grail mythology and
the term grail itself has, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: etymological connections to the Graha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is the vessel that Soma and,
uh, the Persian counterpart of Soma,
[SPEAKER_03]: Haoma were partaking in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like a holy vessel where the
psychoactive beverage is taken in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some interesting stuff in
that, in that mythology and others have
[SPEAKER_03]: suggested that there may be some
connection between the grail mythology and
[SPEAKER_03]: the hashish infusion used by, uh,
uh, the Templars, uh, medieval,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes, uh, enemy, sometimes allies
known as the hashishin group.
[SPEAKER_03]: A group of Islamic heretics that are
reputed to have used hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's controversy about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I answer a lot of that controversy and
go over a lot of the historical material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, my view on the hashishin is this
is a carryover from the earlier Persian
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoroastrian traditions where we read in
the first few centuries ADs, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: accounts of these, uh, Persian,
uh, Psychonauts taking cannabis infused
[SPEAKER_03]: wines and then having other worldly
voyages under the influence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm talking potent
extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they drink like as much as seven
cups of these cannabis infused wines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys have been knocked out for a
couple of days and then they come back and
[SPEAKER_03]: report these visionary experiences they
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was thought to be that their,
their soul had left their body.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where these types of ideas came
from, from people having drug experiences,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So are you kind of along the lines of,
I saw Paul Stamets speak recently and he
[SPEAKER_04]: brought up Terrence McKenna's stoned
monkey theory of the sort of like how
[SPEAKER_04]: consciousness got this spark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Into, into really all these different
things that we've, you know, the creation
[SPEAKER_04]: of from engineering and like complex
civilizations and all these different,
[SPEAKER_04]: all these different concepts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you kind of come from the belief system
that psychedelics and psychoactive
[SPEAKER_04]: substances?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cannabis for sure, you know,
like a Dr. Jeffrey Guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hit it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: This or?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it nicely set up on light.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Acapulco gold that I set up for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a nice little dab there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it all one dab or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there'll be a couple of rips in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just balanced out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was this electric or did you heat?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just push the button and it heats up,
heats up the little atomizer on the bottom
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's all ceramic and yeah,
we've come a long way as we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about the history of cannabis from,
you know, thousands of years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: as we've literally hit the most up to date
sort of futuristic.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys would have tripped a thousand
years ago if you would have been like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, here, try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're saying about Dr. Jeffrey Guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: And John McPartland, they wrote an article
about cannabis being appearing at the time
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Great Leap Forward where many of
these like advancements in human culture
[SPEAKER_03]: took place, invention of the wheel,
control of fire, these types of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that from archaeological
evidence that for at least fiber purposes,
[SPEAKER_03]: our relationship of cannabis goes back
about 25,000 years, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which puts its use into getting close to
the time period of the Great Leap Forward
[SPEAKER_03]: where many of these like technological and
cultural advancements were made,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they speculate it was the ability of
cannabis to cause new novel ways of
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know people are always,
there's always a group of people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: afraid of new novel ways of thinking or
even change of any kind in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as you do research like this,
does it seem as though the prohibition of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis has been around for almost as
long as cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always been people that have felt
repressed by other people using cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you see this with the
disappearance of Soma and Haoma in Persian
[SPEAKER_03]: India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, you know, in psychoactive
substances in general, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like religions like Christianity,
Judaism, they're religions that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: taught.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not really about your own
personal experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more what's the stories in this book
and this is what we believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anything that offers like a hands-on
experiential type of thing or the concept
[SPEAKER_03]: of that God lies within you is a real
threat to that hierarchical way of
thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seem to replace all of that with
faith.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, don't, you know,
have your own experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, just have faith that what we're
telling you is accurate and that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to help you in your life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, you know, I have known people
who have used their religious belief
[SPEAKER_04]: systems to help them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I certainly don't mock people's
religious belief systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I do mock.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I just see, like, I take a look
at the world around me and I just see so
[SPEAKER_03]: much problem caused by this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so much of it seems like so much who
we live for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I, you know, look into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I've really studied religion
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've gone in a lot deeper than I have,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it's just not my fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, if that's what you want to do,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always am refreshed by some of the
things you'll say on Facebook and in some
[SPEAKER_04]: of your posts where you're just like,
no holds barred, guy here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, just like, some of it's pretty
comical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I lose as many supporters as I
gain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whatever you stand by your
opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have done a lot more research on
it than your average.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's, it's right up there with,
it's hard to not connect religion with
[SPEAKER_04]: prohibition because it seems like since
religion has been alive, they prohibited
[SPEAKER_04]: thoughts, experiences, you know,
different, different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always been these rules that
really would be construed as a type of
[SPEAKER_04]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the extreme.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all part of the human experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these things, you know, a lot of
these things may have served a better
[SPEAKER_03]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: In their original times and they serve us
2000 years later and people are trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: force this bronze age laws and mentality
on 21st century men.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, you know, pretty
ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely ludicrous in that sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you think of these things that are
multiple thousands of years old that,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even, even when these guys wrote,
you know, the constitution for,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the U S just like, you know,
in 1776 or whenever that thing got penned.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a, it doesn't really kind of,
you know, with it, like just to simply go
[SPEAKER_04]: into like the gun one, like to bear arms
and protect oneself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like nothing used to be like holding
it and pushing it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's like some machine gun or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a lot of change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it might be a good idea to update
the scriptures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the evangelicals have pretty well
taken things to the limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if Jesus doesn't show up now,
then, you know, I think they should call
[SPEAKER_03]: it a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a very short period of time to
show up at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure those guys will do what they can
to get Armageddon going in, in the Holy
[SPEAKER_03]: land before long, you know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have cannabis on our side,
so we're very lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, it's like my whole
experience with cannabis actually started
[SPEAKER_03]: with a religious experience I had in like
89, 90 reading the Bible and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: reading the books.
[SPEAKER_03]: The book of Revelation stoned and then
reading the last chapter about the tree of
[SPEAKER_03]: life in the book of Revelation with its
many fruits, its 12 manners of fruit and
[SPEAKER_03]: its leaves for the healing of the nations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really what set me on my path.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like the life changing moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So as much as I rewrite it, you know,
at the same time, I realize its role in
[SPEAKER_03]: the collective consciousness of human
history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that what cannabis offers is a
new way of looking at that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think when you really understand the
history of cannabis and its role in,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Hinduism and Sikhism and Daoism
and Buddhism and Judaism and Christianity,
[SPEAKER_03]: Islam and Christianity in our case,
particularly here in the Western world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you take a look at these references to
cannabis and the way it was used,
[SPEAKER_03]: it becomes as much of a threat to
fundamentalist religion as Darwin's theory
[SPEAKER_03]: of evolution was to the myths of Adam and
Eve and creation of Genesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what it shows is that the prophets
of the Bible, in this case, say Moses,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, if we take a look at the
claims about the Hebrew term cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: which have been around for about a century
now, you take Moses and he takes about
[SPEAKER_03]: nine pounds of cannabis and he puts it in
with some urn and cinnamon and some holy
[SPEAKER_03]: oil and he places this on his body and
then he takes some of this oil and he
[SPEAKER_03]: places it on the altar of incense and it
goes inside the enclosed tent,
[SPEAKER_03]: the tent of the meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he speaks to the Lord of the pillar of
smoke over that altar of incense.
[SPEAKER_03]: He becomes like a shaman, you know,
and shamans like in South America and
[SPEAKER_03]: Africa today, ingesting psychoactive
plants and interpreting this as something
[SPEAKER_03]: of divine revelation or spiritualism,
you know, spiritual possession or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that these
fundamental religions have rallied against
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever they've come into contact and we
can see it in the medieval Renaissance
[SPEAKER_03]: period in the cases of both magic and
alchemy and the church's reaction to these
[SPEAKER_03]: things and the use of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a real fundamental threat to
it because it's like firsthand
[SPEAKER_03]: experiential, which is what they don't
offer and something they try to suppress,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it also reveals the origins in things
that they try to suppress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's very symbolic on a
cultural level, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's heavy for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we don't have too many more
centuries of prohibition and of this
[SPEAKER_04]: mentality of this group of people that
just seems to want to prohibit this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seems like a great crime against
humanity that has gone on for centuries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well you see when it does get out how it
blossoms, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there must be like over 150
dispensaries here in Vancouver and many of
[SPEAKER_03]: them are thriving and people there are
pleasant and happy and all walks of life
[SPEAKER_03]: are coming in and getting cannabis and
there's almost like a community center
[SPEAKER_03]: type of atmosphere in some of them,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: People really do feel a connection over
this herb and it's one of the few things
[SPEAKER_03]: in this world that we pass from hand to
hand like that and hand to mouth in any
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of ways and it's kind of like the
people's natural community, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I'll tell you, I certainly
experienced it at 420 this year with the
[SPEAKER_04]: tens of thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't pretend to guess how many were
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people say 20,000, some people say
50,000, some people say 100,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were tens of thousands of people and
it's always such an incredible experience
[SPEAKER_04]: on the stage watching everyone light up
right at 420 and see this cloud of smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: rise up and it's really quite a powerful
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that the same way that there is
power in focused thought like prayer,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a ritual right there, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone lighting up and all the positive
vibes, no one getting hurt and no one
[SPEAKER_04]: fighting and no one getting arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, imagine if that was a beer garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be in chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be still on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would still be putting out fires.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well we know that because it's happened
during our NHL teams losing and other
[SPEAKER_04]: sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The city doesn't talk about making the NHL
pay for the wreck of the city but they
[SPEAKER_03]: sure want to cry the blues about anything
to do with Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I saw Mark had posted something
recently in regards to why we need to
[SPEAKER_04]: still be able to do this because it's that
we're proud of our culture and it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: same way Pride is proud of their culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not illegal to be gay anymore
but it doesn't mean they can't still be
[SPEAKER_04]: proud of their gay culture and they're
going to have their parades and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to have their gatherings.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's our victory day.
[SPEAKER_03]: After legalization, it's our victory day,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We suffered a lot to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen our friends jailed and worse
and we've won it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's our day, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well thanks for joining me, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For letting me join you for that matter
here at your place and it's always really
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting to hear what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll definitely look forward to reading
your book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to pick up a copy for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you guys do as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where can they grab a copy of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can find it on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just search Lieber 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll come up pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some in-depth interviews on our
culture podcast and on Reality Sandwich
[SPEAKER_03]: about the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can check out as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put the links in the comments section
of the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, I think we're going to
hit the boards.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll bring you guys with us so you can go
for a little sunshiny Vancouver Day
[SPEAKER_04]: skateboard with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a riot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
