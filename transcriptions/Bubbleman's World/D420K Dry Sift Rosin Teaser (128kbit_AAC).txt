[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a special guest in today,
D420K, and this is kind of a little teaser
[SPEAKER_01]: video that we're going to give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Darren's been anxious, anxious to get some
of his sift pressed up here into some
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: His D-nail press is still on the back
order, but I guess what we're going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is we're going to give them a little
taste, give you a little taste,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we're going to film an actual
full video where you have... This is some
[SPEAKER_02]: jars that we got put aside for,
but I've got about the same amount of jars
[SPEAKER_02]: as well to do double that amount,
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll pull out the big press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I just thought because it was a
short video and I didn't want to have this
[SPEAKER_01]: giant thing blocking us here on the couch,
figured we'd pull out the small unit,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you haven't even tried the small
unit yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want every one of the units though,
just because they're tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a mechanic, a heavy duty
mechanic, a hot rod mechanic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got your tool chest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want these tools for my fucking shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for your quiver, for your selfish
hash quiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, why don't we get to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some beautiful NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and old Jakey.
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the screen of the 73 screen that
before I really did much sifting,
[SPEAKER_02]: that little trick that you showed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still looks like a solid, like 50 to
60% heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say, yeah, I'd say that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at it under the microscope,
you can see a lot of the crystals.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, I guess we could load up
a little pressing screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little 25 micron screen here
that we're just going to load up and wrap
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of been, I guess, the technique
that I've found to be the simplest so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure lots of different people are
doing lots of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, you can pack in a whole whack
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably most of what's loose and maybe
even a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bust some of that loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my first rosin videos was doing dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really gone back to it much
since, but here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: More or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a fine amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's hard to say what that is,
like whether that's a couple of grams or
[SPEAKER_01]: four grams or three, maybe two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find the purer the heavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's find out in a blink here once we
press it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like the idea of having a screen
that's a little sticky like this because
[SPEAKER_01]: it does make it a little bit easier for
closing it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big of a piece?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, if you pull out a little
bit more there, well, it's about like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would just do two of them and
we'll put one on top and one on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give this a tiny little bit of pre-press
just to get it sort of ready for business.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that mothership on the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: The table again while we're pressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of a problem this way or
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forward.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the first time I got to use
this thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy dropping out on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this will be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, none spilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spilling it would have been damn near a
drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see what kind of a squeeze this
gives off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to give us tons of room on
the side, but we want to close it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's got a timer that's set up on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can leave it even for a little bit
longer than the timer where you can open
[SPEAKER_01]: it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it an open.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We better press that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like for five seconds because it's so
much, it was coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: See it on the pan there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Whoa, that is just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will press that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just get that off for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop it there for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show these guys what we just
pulled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause of course they want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard to tell you how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real nice color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give it a little taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get a little bit off this pan here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never actually had any raws.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might need a little bit of a parchment
paper to wipe that clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how well this collects too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real nice collection on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's enough for a dab,
sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gentlemen and a scholar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's thesis on bong rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost scared me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like zoned right in on that hoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just looking at the melt.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is insanely smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like insanely.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing, growing, building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came out literally so smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can, now I can feel that grabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has been curing for a long time
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that come out nice?
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you would get a couple more presses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would have been the only thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you see the difficulty of using a
smaller unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only have so much room for things to
go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this time I think we should give a five
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cleans up so nice, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grab the camera and show them
because I want to be able to really show
[SPEAKER_01]: that without the shadow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I keep making a shadow because I'm a
noob.
[SPEAKER_01]: D420K is in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, don't you blow away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real nice quality there D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to do a whole video on
squishing this dry sift up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the teaser video.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you guys are going to see if you keep
watching is you're going to see all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this dry sift get pressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All different screens too.
[SPEAKER_02]: All different grades.
[SPEAKER_02]: One from 120 right to 110.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 90, the 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just some percy for right now
before we do the actual vid and do it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we got four, I don't know how many
more jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many jars did I give you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have at least four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got all this to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to do it today, but I want
to go to Slipknot tonight and fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been to a heavy metal concert in
a while and we're pressed for time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to have the proper parchment
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fibers and that sort of stuff that
bubble man mentioned in hash church on
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get the proper stuff because we want no
contaminant because this is absolute
[SPEAKER_02]: solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's finish it off with one more rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to tell you guys that I'm
going to take macro photographs of this
[SPEAKER_01]: and share it in the video because I can
tell already from my naked eye,
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality under the lens is going to
look ridiculous because bubble hash
[SPEAKER_01]: creates a certain type of look to the
rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry sift produces a different type of
rosin as does flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see we still got a really nice
light color with a little bit of darkness
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor and the smoothness of the rip
is just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we got rid of everything that
was harsh in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it sort of delays and comes and grabs
you at the end, but yeah, let's squish it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it up for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew you were going to love this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Careful of the mothership there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear it sizzling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open her up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got a real nice yield on that first
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to still, you could still do
it a third time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would do is tell you to fold
that in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fold it right in half, put it in
between another piece of parchment and
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll be the third one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one I'll leave for like a good
little chunk of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just fold it right in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to make a smaller spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the bottom line is it should for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the power in the press to
squeeze that out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take this and move it somewhere too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right to the edge of the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not taking a chance at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a bad moment for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you want to see some of this come
off the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you could pick up a big chunk of it
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show them what they got.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to see more of this,
keep watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the teaser.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of the weed that keeps me
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of the weed that's through the
mind.
Purpose of the weed gave by this express.
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of the weed let I feel the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ganja is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have been traveling to Kingston for
20 miles and hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have been sleeping on the job with
fat like the clock towers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh vegetation with trees and with
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have to stop and see if the ganja lift
them over the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a biggie because I don't want no
ziggy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give me no palm, just give me time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want no twiggy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No to pop, give me one biggie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's bigger than biggie from a high
grade, give me, give me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff, puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then me puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then me puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then me puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then me puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puff and cough.
Puff and pass.
