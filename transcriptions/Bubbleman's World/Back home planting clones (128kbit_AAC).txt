[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome back to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm freshly back home from the airport and
a wonderful trip with John B.
[SPEAKER_00]: in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say it's wonderful because you know
things worked out okay for me in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did lose my camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely unfortunate but I have
had an incredibly generous person and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to tell you more about them in the
future but I've had a person offer me to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase my camera, to buy me a new camera
and it's not just out of generosity but of
[SPEAKER_00]: course they have photos that they want me
to take for them and I told them that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would gladly take those photos and we had
worked out sort of a deal a while ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: now they've come and said listen we really
feel sick to you about this this camera
[SPEAKER_00]: experience so they've offered to purchase
a new camera for me which is just
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible I'm not going to mention who
they are just yet I'll wait until
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's said and done but I'd love to
tell you about these guys because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: really kind individuals and it was really
touching that someone would you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: could never just take the generosity I
like to earn my own things but the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was like a pre-purchase and I can
earn it by taking photos for them was just
[SPEAKER_00]: an incredible offer and I'm going to be
thanking those guys on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today for now what we're doing is I've
come home and I've come home to some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My clones that I left I left about 18
clones on my way out and they were kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones that I wasn't sure were gonna gonna
make it they were a little rough as it was
[SPEAKER_00]: my wife was taking care of all my garden
for me and she's yeah she's she's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: busy in life right now she's five months
pregnant and so I'm gonna be having
[SPEAKER_00]: another child in the near future here and
I hated to get her to help me and do all
[SPEAKER_00]: this but she took care of my garden the
whole time I was away so super props to
[SPEAKER_00]: Power Woman for taking care of the family
and the house and the garden and rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 of the 18 clones so there's 11 clones
here I've got let's see I've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani I've got an OG cross with a
Romulan I have an East Coast sour diesel I
[SPEAKER_00]: have three barbs three sweet skunks and
two congos and they're all rooted and I
[SPEAKER_00]: figured why don't we transplant them I've
already got my one gallon buckets and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see that I put the names on all of the
buckets right this is my style we're
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling these and we're getting them in
the right buckets right away so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna start off with the OG crossed with
Romulan I was received this strain from
[SPEAKER_00]: John B I really didn't think this clone
was gonna make it it was hurting I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's incredible that it rooted to be
honest but one thing that's taught me
[SPEAKER_00]: about different strains and with cannabis
is that sometimes it's best to not throw
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant away that you think might make
it or you think could make it because it
[SPEAKER_00]: could turn out to be become your favorite
mother it could turn out to become a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could share and pass around and
you know you just I like to have faith in
[SPEAKER_00]: my cannabis and I don't necessarily want
to give up on it so easily so oh gee wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: boom there you go next up Afghani from the
house of the great gardener as many of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the house of the great gardener won
third prize for their cametonic high CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: at the champs show and they won first
prize for solventless barb dry sift that
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt grew and tumbled and then I cleaned
for the final sort of collaboration and it
[SPEAKER_00]: took first place so congratulations to
those guys for you know growing great
[SPEAKER_00]: resin it's always a pleasure to see and
this Afghani is actually pretty healthy so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna pop him into a little bit of
this soilless mixture my soilless mixture
[SPEAKER_00]: is just cocoa fiber and pro-mix nothing
major nothing serious I've added a tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of water but I'm probably still gonna
give these a little feeding at least a
[SPEAKER_00]: light a light feeding before I put these
guys under the lights you can see a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit here that I've got my East Coast sour
diesel has grown up nicely I've got my
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet scum which is just looking great
really happy with that and of course my
[SPEAKER_00]: Konga leaves now these are all very
special genetics that have been passed on
[SPEAKER_00]: to me by friends through you know the
great gardener through higher end and
[SPEAKER_00]: through some other friends that wanted to
remain nameless just super nice guys
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing the genetics and keeping things
moving we mentioned in the video John and
[SPEAKER_00]: I that we might be coming up with an
opportunity that's in Jamaica in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future we met some incredible guys had
some really exciting meetings while we
[SPEAKER_00]: were in Toronto and without telling you
too much we're definitely hoping on one
[SPEAKER_00]: day getting down there and doing a little
research and development doing a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of you know what we do here in Canada
down there in Jamaica so that's exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're gonna be talking more about that
later so we'll move into the East Coast
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel the reason I'm throwing these
all in one gallon pots for those of you
[SPEAKER_00]: that might want to know it truly is a room
issue I don't have the tent space right
[SPEAKER_00]: now I am gonna go this week I believe and
buy another tent so that's good get some
[SPEAKER_00]: space for these plants so we got our
Afghani and we got our East Coast sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel all right perfect I like to just
make a little hole with my fingers these
[SPEAKER_00]: little pea pucks just fit in perfectly
just cover that up and you have a lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant at an angle but we'll see if
that plant wants to straighten up later
[SPEAKER_00]: all right that is Afghani okay next up on
the block Congolese the infamous Congolese
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we tried we waited for a long
time to get this strain and it was funny
[SPEAKER_00]: because I swear the day we maybe the week
we got it my friend told me yeah that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not the actual the real Congolese it's
sorry and so there's always this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Congolese but I assure you
everyone out there in internet land that
[SPEAKER_00]: we got the real Congolese we got one of
them anyway not the very day but the the
[SPEAKER_00]: other one and it is seemingly gaining
notoriety and popularity here in DC
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly by the help of us by sharing
it and giving it away it's hard to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain popular when you're the only one
posting it on the internet you really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to to share to get that strain out so it's
kind of what we're all about me and John
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why you'll be seeing more John
strains out there Medi Hayes, Medi Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: his My Little Ponies you know I've got
I've got two of his Medi Hayes,
[SPEAKER_00]: three of his Medi Hayes right now they're
just they're looking great I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about that all right so now we'll
go East Coast Sahara Diesel little three
[SPEAKER_00]: finger action pop that right in there
don't really have to push down too hard on
[SPEAKER_00]: these at all either they really just will
sit right there and they'll root
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves it's amazing such a delicate
tiny little thing could turn into this you
[SPEAKER_00]: know extremely powerful huge monstrous
plant that we enjoy so much Congolese one
[SPEAKER_00]: more Congo this is a nice Congo she's
rooting out pretty hard to get this all
[SPEAKER_00]: put up under the lights definitely low on
space for lights I almost need another 400
[SPEAKER_00]: up in here it's funny how cannabis just
grows and grows and grows until you have
[SPEAKER_00]: no more room to really live you just the
cannabis would take it all away my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: had a great sign on his grow room door
some years ago you might have seen it in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of my photos and stories it was the
zip line room actually and on the front is
[SPEAKER_00]: tall room it said give weed an inch and
it'll take the whole yard and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: wow isn't that accurate barb I think we
got three barbs in a row we do one two
[SPEAKER_00]: three so we'll get these barbs done up the
award-winning barb I guess we got to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it now it's taking the Dava do first place
and it's taking the champs first place and
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess Matt's plan next is to take it to
Amsterdam and go to the cannabis cup with
[SPEAKER_00]: it he feels that it's a contender that
he's not just winning these cups because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're small but real people are entering
in them each time and he's winning so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's off to him for growing such a nice
resin and producing such a nice strain
[SPEAKER_00]: does a lot of work they're hard workers
there at the Great Gardener so I'm happy
[SPEAKER_00]: to call them my friends and of course I'm
happy to collaborate with them and help
[SPEAKER_00]: them help them win some awards all right
so three barbs we got barb we got barb
[SPEAKER_00]: barb and barb these are also very very
small very small with tiny little roots
[SPEAKER_00]: but just perfect such a nice thing to come
home from Toronto and of course you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you think I was thinking that these clones
would potentially be dead I had gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through all of the ones that had rooted
prior I had taken quite a few so this was
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I got a little zealous in my
clone taking as some of you probably have
[SPEAKER_00]: done out there we get excited right we
want plants we want to plant the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and when they're little like this you
think oh I need more but you don't realize
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they turn into this very one barb
here's my barb so you can see she's a
[SPEAKER_00]: she's a nice sturdy girl she's been topped
about five times and yeah a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow leaves there that I could take off
but otherwise barbs big okay so cover
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys up
[SPEAKER_00]: for the time being these clones are gonna
end up just in these little under these
[SPEAKER_00]: little t5s I don't have anything else for
them right now so they will have to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: as is three barbs and what do we have left
we have two sweet skunks perfect can't
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you how happy I am to be planting
sweet skunks and Congolese it's it's good
[SPEAKER_00]: it's nice keep all these strains and you
get plants going and particularly when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not growing a whole variety of one
plant a whole tent or a whole room you can
[SPEAKER_00]: wash a plant have that resin wash a plant
have that rest and go through the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: wash those four or five grams off each
time find out the ones that really work
[SPEAKER_00]: for you and then start growing more of
those so you can actually save up that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular resin it's kind of what John
and I are on right now doing that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: trip all right so sweet skunk I've been
wanting to plant you for a while now
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful nice little clone right there
nice little clone rooted rooted all right
[SPEAKER_00]: all right one sweet skunk there one more I
actually have three sweet skunks that have
[SPEAKER_00]: rooted and I have a couple of the
seedlings that I really want to transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm out of one gallon pots go figure I
need hundreds of these things it's amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: how fast we go through these things when
you're growing all right one more sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk I'll take the one with the biggest
roots I guess looks like you or you you
[SPEAKER_00]: look pretty good that's a double sweet
skunk right there let's do it
[SPEAKER_00]: cut off a few of these little sick leaves
all
[SPEAKER_00]: right so
[SPEAKER_00]: barb barb sweet skunk and sweet skunk so
now it's a matter of figuring out getting
[SPEAKER_00]: my t5 lights mounted over these plants so
I'm going to figure that out probably hit
[SPEAKER_00]: a bowl or two but I wanted to share a
little bit of transplanting with you as
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm freshly back and we're getting back
into showing you guys the amount of time
[SPEAKER_00]: and energy that it takes how many plants
you need to cut the mothering the cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course most importantly a couple of
eight by four tents with a couple of 600
[SPEAKER_00]: watt light bulbs in each one producing
those 30 to 60 grams of resin per tent
[SPEAKER_00]: every 60 to 90 days that's what I'm trying
to show you guys here on bubble man world
[SPEAKER_00]: so keep watching we'll talk to you later
Peace!
you you
