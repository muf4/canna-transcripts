[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a bubble man's world and I'm the
camera guy right now so So here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are outside the damn crane gallery in
beautiful Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're with Greg from the damn crane
gallery We got Flav421 in the house who's
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously brought the glass to town.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Ed Borg in the house and we got
Dougie from Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just standing out here about to
go into the gallery and check out the show
[SPEAKER_05]: and Greg and Flav421 are gonna take us
through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_05]: Love the vibes in the damn crane gallery.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a quick peek here, but then we'll
come back and we'll do the rest down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Top of the stairs smells amazing by the
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on the top floor of the damn crane
gallery.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two shows running in parallel
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We hosted a show a few weeks ago with Team
Japan, Snick and Salt.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a few pieces remaining here in the
cabinet from those guys and today you guys
[SPEAKER_06]: are at the opening of Flav421 History in
the Making.
[SPEAKER_06]: We invited Dave who's a personal or a
private collector of glass and to exhibit
[SPEAKER_06]: some really great examples of the history
of glass in the last let's say 10-20
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the best examples that we picked
out from Dave's collection.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got an epic M&P piece, but I'm not
the one really to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave can inform us much better about those
pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, as he was saying this is a Max Pawn
piece and it was the entry for Smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: Volume 1, a book that was done a number of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in 2008.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot bigger in person than the book.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the book you actually, if you smoke the
recent M&P piece you kind of get used to
[SPEAKER_06]: them at this size and then you see this
piece and you see how epic it is with all
[SPEAKER_06]: the marbles.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a monster, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the huge lightning cane that he's
always been so well known for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally his trademark.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the marbles really do the piece so
much justice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You come into the back of the pipe and you
actually realize it's a double bubbler for
[SPEAKER_05]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people miss that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just see the one single can.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the second can which is the
big bulbous part right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is absolutely stunning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty sure it would be some epic pictures
you guys will be seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one here is Brandon Martin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from his box set series from a couple
years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe 2012, 2013.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just your beautiful Brandon Martin
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got some nice fume work, some nice
line work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got this nice little Brandon Martin
creature on the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another massive part of his trademark.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fuming and the horns on this one
matches so nicely too.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's a really nice piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: The big hands on the little dude holding
the marble up.
[SPEAKER_04]: What year is this one Dave?
[SPEAKER_04]: 2011, 2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe this one was done in early 2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather recent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the number zero which actually
doesn't come with a box.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you get numbers with a box?
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it often.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was when he first did the creature
series in the mini tubes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He hadn't done the box concept yet but it
was the first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an identical height set series of
mini tubes with one creature on it and
[SPEAKER_04]: then some extra stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I got the number zero before he ever
started doing them with the box.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the equivalent of getting an
artist's crew for the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we have here?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two small but quite epic little
pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one here is a mothership.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the only double drain Klein hookah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the only double drain Klein made by
Scott Duffy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a sea to life turk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a marble on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little ready fumed frozen galaxy
type marble.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the marble on top Dave, is this what
Duffy did?
[SPEAKER_04]: Duffy did the whole piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: He assembled it, he blew all the pieces,
he did the marble.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have any of the hose
attachments but this is a fumed ready
[SPEAKER_04]: line.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one is a banjo Joe Peters
collab.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the three from the Queen Hybe
series.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the smallest of the three.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hits like a champ.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the best hitting pieces for
small ones that you could really have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really, really pull hard on that
and the water doesn't come up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the tiniest amount of water like Dave
showed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a thimble full of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say it's one of my favorite ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one here has been on Mark's show a
lot but as it deserves to be because this
[SPEAKER_04]: is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than Marcel being one of my
favorites, this piece in particular,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the Phoenix Totem Bubbler.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically like Marcel's own personal
totem pole.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think he's ever written about it
like that but I've talked to him about it
[SPEAKER_04]: enough to know that that's how he feels
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the octopus and the phoenix,
both are his totem symbols.
[SPEAKER_04]: When he was asked to do a piece for Smoke
2, Volume 2, the second installation from
[SPEAKER_04]: the first book that the Max Pollan piece
is from, this was what he felt he had to
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the books, David, was that common
with both Smoke, Volume 1 and Volume 2
[SPEAKER_06]: that they were pieces that were asked
either to be made or to submit it to the
[SPEAKER_06]: book?
[SPEAKER_04]: The artists were individually asked to be
a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, over here, some of the things we
brought that was just lying around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily the best stuff in the
world but the ghost piece is certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is from 2011.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a really nice example of
sculpted glass, sculpted poro with
[SPEAKER_04]: electroforming.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the little pieces that are attachments
are little household items like diodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like an AV converter that's been
electroformed and attached to the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: One really nice piece on it is on the
back, you'll have to go around,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's got a freak marble on it,
a freak brain marble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those, I've always personally quite loved
quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that freak brain marble is
absolutely stunning.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I better go around and show them because
we talked about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's amazing out of its stand too.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you hold it in your hand,
it feels naturally formed and the weight
[SPEAKER_06]: is just right on the bottom of the grip.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a handle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hits amazing and it's got like a ladder
perk here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like just yesterday I was hitting
that tube.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, about a week ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually about two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is a sandblasted Paco FYC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Toro with ash capture.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Toro's lost a lot of its... So that's a
Fuck Your Crew, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they came out with Fuck Your Crew,
I just laughed so hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so perfectly Slinger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking Toro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Slinger was living in Vancouver when he
first started learning about the
[SPEAKER_05]: sandblasting and the stencil work.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really where he got into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we get to be there for the birth of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really nice to kind of show the ghost
with the metal work, but then show the
[SPEAKER_06]: Paco with the sandblasting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, they're so, so different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It literally looks like it comes from a
different culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and even like to compare another
technique over beside it here,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is a Dave Parks tube.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a little more modern design,
a little more, you know, modern art style,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the Rappenreich Snake Skin that he's
really known for is really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a really nice example of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really nice example, too,
of a nice small bowl, too, that fits
[SPEAKER_06]: really nicely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we got the swing there,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually what I need.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the bowl I need.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the bowl you need?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the bowl you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we don't need to... Ah,
right, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what do we have down at the
bottom here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Down at the bottom?
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the left and on the right,
it's an artist that's no longer actually
[SPEAKER_04]: on the torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name's Steve Gelb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he runs a mountain bike store now and
he fixes bikes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's too bad he's not on the torch
because he's a really amazing artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just more older examples of
some ray gun.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got some nice reversals and some... I
think I'll pull out my Gelb Sherlock in
[SPEAKER_06]: the next couple of days because there's a
lot of things at the same time where it's
[SPEAKER_06]: like...
Yeah, you should.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should put him in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to smoke with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one in the middle is an ease,
electroformed, fumed, direct inject tube.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really nice fuming in the dome as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see these kind of like oval marks
to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite is the fuming tube in the
middle section.
[SPEAKER_04]: The silver and the gold and the way it's
wrapped is just... It's just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then lastly... It's certainly not
least.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly not least because this is a
really popular piece, but this is the
[SPEAKER_04]: Brandon Martin Functional Doll Number 1.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dome's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the breathing apparatus where the
breathing tube mouthpiece would be on the
[SPEAKER_04]: doll.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually a percolator so it's an
inline right in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the mouthpiece is the part on the
side of the head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how you got forks on the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so he's utilized different household
materials.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, just much the same way that Ghost
did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And has formed them into the different
aspects of the doll.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave, the blue coloring here is absolutely
incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know if that was...
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that was actually a blue
color.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks porcelain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you wait until it's night time and
you see light shine through it when it's
[SPEAKER_04]: dark, it's actually all see-through.
[SPEAKER_04]: The light shines right through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see right inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see on the back here that he's
actually... Not easily, I'm sure,
[SPEAKER_04]: but he's electroformed his name into the
back of the piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And tie signature just beside it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just...
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brandon.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Brandon Martin's a beast, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy's just a beast.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're gonna host a show with Brandon
Martin in May of next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already started the work and
figuring out which collabos we're gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: host with Brandon.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good show to hold.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a guy that really deserves a lot of
respect for the work he does.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's doing these fantastic pieces where
the smoking piece fits into the... We're
[SPEAKER_04]: okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's falling off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... It's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Brandon's doing this piece that
he's bringing down to Art Basel in
[SPEAKER_06]: Florida, which has these heavy,
heavy metal feet that the puppet fits
[SPEAKER_06]: into.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you reveal it to the puppet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the most amazing... One of the most
amazing pieces I've seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's coming in May?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's preparing that for Miami right
now, for Art Basel in Miami.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's just... He and I are working
through some of the concepts that he wants
[SPEAKER_06]: to present here in May.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll work with a few other artists
and get that going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, we've got some big plans.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's wonderful to finalize on this one
and just take a look at the incredible
[SPEAKER_06]: work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because not many people are doing anything
of this caliber and mixing the different
[SPEAKER_06]: media and trying to make both a functional
and an aesthetic puppet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's nice to make it available to the
public.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel fairly blessed because I can just
go over to Dave's house and see this on
[SPEAKER_05]: his hutch in his living room where it
sits.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's nice for other people to be able
to come here and actually see the quality
[SPEAKER_05]: of the piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's dangling on a chain.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a concept alone right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually just hit it just like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to hit it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see what you mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke from it while it's hanging.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've hit it with you one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: One time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's one of the things that we
really wanted to do here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe is not very big on the smoking
glass culture because as you see,
[SPEAKER_06]: we hope it improves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why we're here, is to expose
this type of work for both people to
[SPEAKER_06]: understand the workmanship that goes into
it, the type of artists that are working
[SPEAKER_06]: in this these days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also some of its scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when you see this in a photograph,
you would assume that it might be as big
[SPEAKER_06]: as a cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I saw the Max Pollan piece in smoke,
I assumed also that it was like a smaller,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, lightning bolt type piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we pulled it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Max is a big boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He can blow big pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like honestly, like holding that glass on
a punny stick and like flipping it over a
[SPEAKER_05]: flame.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we'll maybe go downstairs and take
a quick peek.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, one sec.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on November 1st, which is museum night
in Amsterdam, we hosted what we believe to
[SPEAKER_06]: be truly a museum level glass
collaboration that we facilitated between
[SPEAKER_06]: five artists.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Snick and Salt from Texas,
the St. Elmo's Fire Studio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have Yoshikondo, Rose Rhodes,
and Daisuke Saito, who goes by the name
[SPEAKER_06]: Disc Glass, also known for his slop work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are the beasts that were put
together by the guys over the course of 13
[SPEAKER_06]: months.
[SPEAKER_06]: The story behind these are that they're
all mythical beasts of Japan.
[SPEAKER_06]: The show was called Yokaiju, Yokai being
the shapeshifting ghosts and the kaiju
[SPEAKER_06]: being more the dragon demon like Godzilla
characters.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guys worked back and forth sending
stuff by mail, but also flying down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two of the guys from Japan flew down to
the DFO and then stayed in the United
[SPEAKER_06]: States and continued to work with the
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what came out of it was about 17 beasts
of this sort of epic nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything from the smaller guys that you
see up top to the more epic beasts in the
[SPEAKER_06]: middle and two monster beasts that we have
downstairs, as well as a few slop cups.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love the slop cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: With this one, the next one that you're
shooting the sake bottle, all the tiny,
[SPEAKER_06]: tiny white dots, the ring at the top and
just the tiny dots in that kind of brick
[SPEAKER_06]: type stack, those are all UV reactive.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a slight layer under the eyelid
that's UV reactive, but the guys hit it in
[SPEAKER_06]: a very subtle fashion.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also a really interesting set of
teeth from Salt, where it's a fully
[SPEAKER_06]: circular but hollow set of teeth
underneath.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that chomper, literally like a circular
set of teeth that would just bite into
[SPEAKER_06]: anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is so cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the hanging head.
[SPEAKER_06]: So epic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the ogre and we've got these
silver formed glass with silver over top
[SPEAKER_06]: blades that have been sharpened by the
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the decapitated head that the
ogre had captured.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, that's really, really impressive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the bottom, we have an
interpretation of three different sake
[SPEAKER_06]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_06]: So similar to the clear one, we've got
sort of smaller drinking bottles at the
[SPEAKER_06]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a green one, a pink one,
and a purple guy over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each of them having their own Japanese
beast name as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: As we move over to the right, you'll see
just like you were filming the big cab on
[SPEAKER_06]: the road, the Rose Roads cab on this one,
is similar to the one from up top with the
[SPEAKER_06]: spider, where all the clear dots between
the blue dots are all UV reactive.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once you pop a black light onto this,
everything that's clear just explodes in
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of like a white green ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just noticed the woman on this guy's
chest.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll also notice the woman on the guy's
chest softens.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she becomes very deeply blasted at the
top and then it softens around the legs so
[SPEAKER_06]: that there's no integrity lost in the
structure of the leg.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this beast is called Iyaya,
which means a woman whose face reflects as
[SPEAKER_06]: an old man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see the falling slop woman
looking up at the old man.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little tough with the light in here too,
but behind the Rose Roads eye millies is
[SPEAKER_06]: also a layer of UV.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this one is very tactile and it's UV
usage as well, just behind the eyeballs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got, we've got snick and salt
working on the hands and the face.
[SPEAKER_06]: The feet are very obviously snicked.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you've got a Yoshi marble on the
back and the Rose Roads cabs and disc
[SPEAKER_06]: glass die skate did the shaping of the
bottle in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our goal is really to start exposing
this type of work in the neighborhood
[SPEAKER_06]: we're fortunate enough to have a glass
gallery that's been across the street for
[SPEAKER_06]: about 27 years and they deal contemporary
glasswork that's not functional.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a nice relationship with those
guys across the street where the artists
[SPEAKER_06]: come over here to check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our artists when they visit,
love to check out the stuff across the
[SPEAKER_06]: street.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the name of that place?
[SPEAKER_06]: The name of the place across the street is
called the Briajoti Gallery.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Briajoti?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Christian Briajoti.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's right across from the Damkring
Gallery.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you guys are looking to look and
find the Damkring Gallery, it's located at
[SPEAKER_06]: 395 in the heart of Amsterdam,
right behind the stout line and right near
[SPEAKER_06]: the floating flower market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for walking us through this,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for rolling through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the main floor of the original
Damkring Gallery.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may have been here before and seen
this piece by Bern Feinmeyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bern Feinmeyer and Martin was not a part
of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all Bern Feinmeyer.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a collaboration between Martin,
between Ruhr and Bern Feinmeyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is the cup winning entry for 2011.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was right on or next to my booth that
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then beside your booth last year,
did you have a booth last year?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And was Ruhr beside your booth with the
backpack last year?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're always either at my booth or
beside my booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most years I've told Martin he can put
whatever he needs to put on my booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've just been doing that for almost
10 years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then part of the extension of the yokai
juice stuff that you saw upstairs,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have two slop cups that are in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We call them slop cups, but they're
actually five man collaborations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really hard to see under the plastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll move some of this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, this one is a great thing to
show outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got one side which has a very salt
like face.
[SPEAKER_06]: With two fantastic eye millies.
[SPEAKER_06]: The eye millies are insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Insane, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's an eye milly on the dome
of a different pattern.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful teeth too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And look at from the side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you have both faces.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the snick and the salt.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're moving over to the snick side
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're three different millies.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that Bindi milly?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm going to also take the diffuser
out and show you from the bottom,
[SPEAKER_06]: because this was pretty special.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing how the bottom looked.
[SPEAKER_06]: How Yoshi's section was kind of pulled and
spotted.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's almost made it look like one of his
marbles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll turn it around and you see
the same kind of thing from the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get in there without touching that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So absolutely outstanding work.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are three collaboration cups
remaining.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the artist up here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is Yoshi Kondo.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's one of the artists that we had on our
show.
Yoshi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Respect Yoshi.
[SPEAKER_05]: The photos that we have on the wall are by
a photographer named Akiko.
[SPEAKER_05]: Akiko.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job Akiko.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are nice shots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she visited Yoshi's studio and made
the photographs and we printed them up on
[SPEAKER_06]: the wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some making up photographs as
well that were shot by Yoshi himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do the same thing with a marble.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's one in here I really want to
show you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a new style marble that Yoshi Kondo
created specifically for this show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of his stuff is extremely circular.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's circular and symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is circular and symmetrical,
but what you've got here now is you've
[SPEAKER_06]: got, he kind of breaks the circle on the
top and you've got this character inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll turn it this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this would, you know, to most people
would look like a fairly regular Kondo
[SPEAKER_06]: marble.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as soon as you turn it,
you've all of a sudden got the breaking of
[SPEAKER_06]: the circle up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And his new style pendants are like this
beast inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the beast, usually, you can turn them
upside down and see multiple faces.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, Mark, like Bubble Man,
like you were saying earlier, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: these things, this is hours and hours of
entertainment and enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's got... Yeah, hold it right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got an opal stack.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to turn it so Yoshi's signature
is right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can adjust.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got, well, you've got diamond
opal underneath his signature opal
[SPEAKER_06]: underneath an octagon opal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are kidding me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way that Yoshi explained it to me
is he always puts things inside his
[SPEAKER_06]: marbles for people to enjoy who have had
his marbles for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So even owning this for a very long time,
you will find surprises in it as you sit
[SPEAKER_06]: there and trip out on his glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a very intentional part of his
work is that, you know, these are epic
[SPEAKER_06]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: They take a long time to make,
but he wants people to constantly discover
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about Gates and Reco's
marbles.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like deep universes, things
floating in space that are only revealed
[SPEAKER_06]: when you turn them certain ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great name, really, for the Gates and
marbles, the universe marbles.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take you over to see three
more pieces that we have here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually four.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to open the cabinet so we
don't get the glare.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is onigiri.
[SPEAKER_06]: Onigiri, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Onigiri.
[SPEAKER_06]: Onigiri are rice rolls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Onigiri.
[SPEAKER_06]: Onigiri?
[SPEAKER_06]: Onigiri.
[SPEAKER_06]: Onigiri are actually the sushi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, why does that sound...
So it's very close and I kept
[SPEAKER_06]: mispronouncing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife who's Japanese made sure that I
got it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: These, this is, I mean, what you're seeing
here, maybe people don't always know,
[SPEAKER_06]: but actually, accidents happen in glass
when the guys are working on the stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things explode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colors are not always compatible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's a great little piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: These faces that have the wonderful Akio
inclusion in the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a miniature rose road to Millie
in this one, which just bonkers how these
[SPEAKER_06]: guys look.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what happened is these little demons
that you're looking at here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these demons were adhered to the front
of the feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: The story goes that this guy captures the
demons with his mouth and with his feet
[SPEAKER_06]: and stomps them and the skulls come
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: When these were put in the kiln,
they exploded on the feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we still deal in an area that's quite
risky.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, fire burns, glass cuts,
and not all glass is compatible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hot glass cuts and burns.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So check out the tail.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a Yoshi marble, that's a Yoshi
stack that's been pulled out into a tail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely stunning.
[SPEAKER_06]: The line work is so fine in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: More bonkers.
[SPEAKER_06]: More bonkers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have all the different sections in
the middle, plus the signature Millies on
[SPEAKER_06]: both sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tiny skulls by Aquarius.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first time these seven guys
have ever come together to make a piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from their assumption, this is the
first time seven artists from Japan have
[SPEAKER_06]: ever come together to make anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really historical, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a dome that they made that's
available separate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's again, the complexity in this is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have TK Hapa that did the cobalt hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've got the Akio inclusion on the
top, plus the opal underneath it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got a Yoshi stack on the bottom of
the dome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are photographs throughout the
gallery and some videos behind me of the
[SPEAKER_06]: making of this piece as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's great that you guys managed to,
you know, record, get video, get photos,
[SPEAKER_06]: and really sort of... All props to Team
Japan.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a great job recording everything
so that we could explain to people who had
[SPEAKER_06]: never seen this.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times, Mark, I'm sure you know,
people assume that it's paint.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's paint inside some kind of layer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to really explain how this dot stack
worked here, how these tiny dots on the
[SPEAKER_06]: opal...
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just looking at the opal in the eye.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's completely insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of floats above.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of Takao Miyake's work is like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're two separate colored eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the opal just floats gently,
gently above.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you swing around in this
direction, you might be able to see... Oh
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, you can catch it for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I mean, the dome... The dome is
also incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the opal on the top there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just... Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've got to hop a signature opal,
a signature milling inside the eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're gonna move down to one,
two more epic pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a Sherlock that was made in
preparation for this show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very... Should we take one of these pieces
outside to show you the beauty of them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that'd be a great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll take the Sherlock and we'll...
Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll quickly show you the other one
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe bring them both.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, bring them both.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll shut this for you.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alison's got the...
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask you to hold this?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how to handle epic glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll get you to hold this.
[SPEAKER_05]: She knows how to handle epic glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll show this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a much better scene here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see the same type of eye that you were
looking at earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: The color in the metal fuming is cobalt.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Yoshi section in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a Takamiake sort of mandala
here too that you saw inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this one's really special.
[SPEAKER_06]: His dot stacks usually are the colored dot
stacks, which everybody is starting to
[SPEAKER_06]: know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to turn this sideways,
just not gently, so that you can see that
[SPEAKER_06]: there's metal fuming between the dots
that's popped up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely bonkers work.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a great example of the fuming
coming up about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mind-blowing, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I'm going to switch hands here.
[SPEAKER_06]: God, the top of that bowl is impressive
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can hop up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now what we have is the seven-man Team
Japan cup here.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys don't make cups often.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a few examples of two,
three, and four-man cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the first seven-man cup ever
created.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a, excuse my language,
shitload of Troutman glass in here called
[SPEAKER_06]: Half-Life.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Team Japan were the first to get a lot
of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a Coca-Cola color that,
I think this is Black Jack, the skull,
[SPEAKER_06]: so it's actually not fully black.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a Coca-Cola color.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you've got a uranium eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just saw that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to ask you, is that a uranium
marble in the eye?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a uranium dot in the eye that
glows incredibly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I'm literally focused in on that
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And isn't it perfectly set?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, when you look beyond it,
it's like looking at a jewel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a little eye in the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, no, it's unreal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a perfect orb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm going to turn it around so you can
see the skull on the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, let's just turn the dome.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, I just realized, dude, that the,
oh my god.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't notice the goggles.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're goggles.
[SPEAKER_06]: The little eye goggles.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're eye goggles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Until we took it outside, I didn't realize
that they were strapped to the head.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just put his eyes up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just put his eyes up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: This piece keeps exciting me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we've got here is also the first
time that anybody's gone over Yoshi's
stack.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, he's doubled it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so what you have here is you have an
Akio Izumi line over top of Yoshi's dots.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the use of uranium in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the white dots in here and all
the white dots in here will glow,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the middle does not.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, this is a fairly special piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would a piece like this... This one
we're asking 21,000 US dollars or about
[SPEAKER_06]: 18,000 euro.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were a few pieces that were made
similar to this that were used to fund the
[SPEAKER_06]: trip and to fund Team Japan's work for
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is the Sherlock that we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_06]: That, for example, is valued at about
5,000 US dollars around that range.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of them are kind of great pieces for
collectors to scoop now.
[SPEAKER_05]: When does Ed get to take that home?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ed gets to take that home when he puts his
last down payment on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's very close and this is truly an
unbelievable scoop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to puff it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to puff it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really respect the glass and we work
closely with the artist.
[SPEAKER_06]: We usually work with our collectors to
make sure that if the collectors at any
[SPEAKER_06]: point in time do want to get rid of their
piece, we will help them move that piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the same way that traditional art
galleries and museums have helped
[SPEAKER_06]: collectors move their pieces, we prefer to
move it with all the authenticity
[SPEAKER_06]: documents, all the things that we have for
it, move it to the next customer if that's
[SPEAKER_06]: the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're really here to showcase
spectacular work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the one last thing about this cup,
you've got the signatures all on the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go and I can see them great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so you got from left to right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Akio, Takao, Slop, Yoshikondo.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got Aquarius on the bottom as well
and you've got Rose Road's signature.
[SPEAKER_05]: What signature is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Yoshikondo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the YK, so I'll turn it around for
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely ridiculous, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much half-life in this thing too.
[SPEAKER_05]: The goggles.
[SPEAKER_06]: The duck boxes are right behind the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Behind those nice chairs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, start unpacking them if you
guys would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring some of it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for taking us through the show,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really appreciated.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got Doug from Hitman Glass here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got his fine lady holding some
incredible glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we're going to start showing some
of the torch tubes and collabos that these
[SPEAKER_06]: guys brought that are just going to be
bonkers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's next.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's next.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then tomorrow we're going to pop up a
shop for some of the smaller stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: downstairs and we'll host Hitman
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get down there with some bubble
bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Craig.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, bubble man.
Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of the weed that keeps me
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of the weed that's through the
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of the weed gave by this
expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of the weed let time fuel the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ganja is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have been traveling to Kingston for
20 miles and hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have been sleeping on my job with
fat like the clock towers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh vegetation with trees and with
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to stop and check my ganja,
lift them up above.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a biggie, but I don't want no
ziggy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give me no palm, just give me time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want no twiggy, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: No two pop, give me one biggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's bigger than biggie from a high
grade, give me me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff, puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then me puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then me puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then me puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of the weed that keeps me
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of the weed that's through the
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of the weed gave by this
expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of the weed let time fuel the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weed is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ganja is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I imagined down the road there'd be
some cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Setting up them plat and steam and all the
wrecking, all the weed traps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, true man, I rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man weed rems, don't rems and tell me how
few rems I'm fast at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up on the scene, two-pound intervene.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my brain, stay that keen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And behind the scene, me and Martin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have another 25 pounds, if you come in,
they'll be smoking it up clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I rest now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then me puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then me puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then me puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then me puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make a do-fan pass, do-fan pass,
do-fan pass do-fan pass, do-fan pass
