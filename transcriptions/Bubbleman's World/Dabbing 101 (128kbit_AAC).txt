[SPEAKER_00]: Hello to the whole team at Embark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we are going to go through the
anatomy of a concentrate rig, talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about dabbing, talk a little
bit about the different types of materials
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'll be dabbing off of, the
different types of pipes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available, and really kind of going over a
whole broad stroke of the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was originally asked to do this,
it was told to me that some of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the company had been telling people
about the different products that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: making, in particular full melt hash,
and maybe the question had arisen,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you consume it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, after today's little 101 on
dabbing, we should all be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the anatomy of the concentrate
rig, the types of rigs, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate rig, water pipe, the types of
nails, which are titanium quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are glass nails, but that's really
the cheapest you can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ceramic nails, there are
electric nails, all of which I have here
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, I also have sapphire nails here
on the table today, I'm going to be going
[SPEAKER_00]: through a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk a little bit about the dome
vapor slide, people aren't using those too
[SPEAKER_00]: much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, the essential dab
tools, which I have all here on the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the rig, the nails, the torch,
the dabber tools, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: the concentrate containers that are
holding the hash that we'll be dabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: here today for this 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go through proper use, safe
consumption, and how to clean and maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: these rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you guys should have this
document as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start, I want to talk about a few of
the different rigs that I have here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of the pipes are from a company
called mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you don't need to have a
mothership pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called a Faberge egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is called a Klein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in regards to the type of
filter that he's blown inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all sorts of different,
there's Taurus's and Klein's and Faberge
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hollow pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what I'm talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these are water pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these can be used either with a
torch or with an electric nail or even
[SPEAKER_00]: with the beam that I have over here,
which I'll talk about in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got full melt bubble hash as well as
a little bit of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some five-star bubble hash and
some six-star bubble hash, meaning when I
[SPEAKER_00]: put it on the rig, it's going to boil and
liquefy and vaporize in a way that leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: very little chafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about what happens when you
hit too hot, but there are reasons why we
[SPEAKER_00]: have all these different units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we'll talk about, for starters,
these are our titanium dabbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need a dab tool because this
material is very greasy and you'll need to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of stick your dab tool in there to
get a dab out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to come on over and do it
right to the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can get, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see if that looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're basically going to stick our
little dabber in here and just get a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: little dab out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need too much, especially because
I'm probably going to have to take more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one and generally one is more than
enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just do small ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little dab right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be using the Klein over
here and we're going to be using the Peli
[SPEAKER_00]: nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Pelican nail has a quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This banger is pretty unique in the sense
that it has a stub coming out the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: with a tiny little pin that fits through
and holds this electric coil in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only really thing you need on top of
this rig, your pipe and the Pelican nail,
[SPEAKER_00]: which comes with the whip and the coil,
the banger and a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the things that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your dabber, you've got your
carb cap and the simply put, we know our
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature is 430 degrees Fahrenheit,
which is a nice low vape temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly not going to burst the
material into flames and cause my throat
[SPEAKER_00]: soreness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like low temp dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always turn it up if you want to
get a smokier hit, if you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: coughing, if you want to really feel that
grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a reason that some people
want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you suffer from pain or
massive inflammation, which is causing
[SPEAKER_00]: your pain, a really hot dab can really
reduce some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go for a connoisseur hit
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the pipe in hand, bring it up to your
lips and let go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your dabber right in there and rub it
up against the walls until it all melts
[SPEAKER_00]: down into the pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it's done that, which it's doing
right now, you want to get it all off,
[SPEAKER_00]: put your carb cap on and pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put our carb cap back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now part of maintenance, this part of
maintenance we're going to be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: involves some Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sent some silicon reusable Q-tips
recently, which I think is great because
[SPEAKER_00]: this is wasteful and we can do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then edit that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do hope we can do better with the
reusable Q-tips in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got the DC glass crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is dark crystal glass, nature's
cleaning solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is made out of water,
caranja oil, coconut extract, kelp
[SPEAKER_00]: extract, extract of sugar cane,
completely non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you drop it into the quartz
dabber, it really only works with the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat, but when you drop it into the top of
the bong, of the banger, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sizzles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it's sizzling, it just boils and
cleans the inside of the banger to near
[SPEAKER_00]: perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do this after every dab and that way
the next person that comes along isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get a dab that is not enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is called dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is quite important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just A, take a dab with
someone's pipe and then not really have
[SPEAKER_00]: the understanding on how to simply clean
it afterwards, which is I'm sure most
[SPEAKER_00]: people would be kind enough to do it for
you the first couple of times,
[SPEAKER_00]: but eventually it's something that you
want to learn yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was unfortunately unable to find the
battery to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this really is, is it's a laser
thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits under the pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put this over here because
I'm almost, well I've knocked it down once
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was the second almost knock it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can put it right under your pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be this close by any
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be like three or four inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was on, it would be reading the
temperature of the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could hit the banger with the torch,
the banger being this bowl right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could heat it all up with the torch,
get it to the point where I put it under
[SPEAKER_00]: here, wait for that 430 degree temperature
that I like oh so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when I could hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this isn't working and it's great
because I don't have a battery for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those square nine volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I can show you how we did it before
this technology existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fairly large quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't be heating it up for too long,
but generally we used to do it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would heat it up for 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would cool it down for 50 to 55 seconds
and then we would take our hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then, you know, the first time you
hit a new banger, you can kind of extend
[SPEAKER_00]: the cool down period or decrease the cool
down period to find that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too hot, you want to, you want to
extend the cool down period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, past 55 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not hot enough, uh, you would want
to maybe start hitting it at 45 seconds or
[SPEAKER_00]: even 40 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we're going to have a hit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our blow torch here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already filled it up with the butane
gas over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so I will do the two methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do the timer method, but I will
also show you a method that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: been using even before the timer came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it's quite convenient as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the, um, basically the same way
you would test a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bottle, you hold your wrist right
over the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really hot, I tell people when
they say, well, how do I know when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell them, well, how it feels on your
wrist is how it's going to feel on your
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wait until it's cooled down and feels
good on your, on your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get our timer started here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, I like to keep my pipes as
clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always possible, but I'll go over
how easy that is at the end of this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will reset and start that over and we
will go for a 45 to 50 second cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure we're not spilling hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit the, uh, wedding cake is
what we're hitting this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: First hit was the strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use a different carb cap this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can kind of put your wrist up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too hot at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go now we're outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's cooling it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: No cough, no strain, no heat, just a
really great taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that for me is really my favorite
aspect of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now understand dabbing is multi
dimensional and it's more than what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really like hitting hot dabs
and coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like anything, people will judge
people that do things differently than how
[SPEAKER_00]: they do them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I implore you not to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people are enjoying dabs, let them be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is our, uh, one of our company's
missions to make product that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, at the top of the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that are also doing this can
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, as, as, as much as the
medical patients can enjoy it,
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as the recreational patients,
I really just want us to be able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: an exceptional quality of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so people can do this very experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps in settings like these and just,
uh, really get into a great head space.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to clean this up with a
little Q tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get our DC glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: There he is hiding over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bet, the, you know, the reason you
want to keep these bangers clean is first
[SPEAKER_00]: of all, they're very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they sell for two and three and $400 a
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, quartz being a lot harder to,
to work with than borosilicate,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's nice to keep your,
your, your bangers as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's a little terminology for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you heat the banger up way too hot,
like heating it up for 40, 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 seconds, and then only letting it cool
down for 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when you put the dab on top of that,
it's going to almost burn and sear to the
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that terminology, um, we call
chassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chassing the banger is a pretty big
no-no in the world of dabbing etiquette,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, much like not cleaning your,
your, your bowl out is, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: chassing it is a, is a real bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also shows you how powerful the little
dark crystal glass cleaner is because
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes the worst chas and what I mean
by that, and you can kind of see it on
[SPEAKER_00]: this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I bring it forward, uh, this is a
fairly old unit and it's been,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, smoked out of quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see it's cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a little bit chassed on the
bottom here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time it gets like this and the DC
glass cleaner can't pick it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to fire it with a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The torch breaks it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little bit of dust kind of gets into
the porous quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you end up with this smoky
looking, uh, quartz, which is just not as
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, um, as the clean, nice big quartz
shining in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can really appreciate,
appreciate that right there compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the chas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were both gifts for me,
but between the two of them, I think they
[SPEAKER_00]: are, they're worth about five or 600 us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you know, when someone's paying
that money, they really want to learn the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper way to use these bangers and make
sure that they're not doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so detrimental that they're going
to shorten the life cycle, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: by a large amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, we have a bunch of different types
of dabs here we can talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some water hash, bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivar is called wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we would call it six star as it pretty
much boils away and disappears to almost
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little material left on the Q-tips
when you clean the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've got some grateful heads here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the, the Jagger, uh, rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just pours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could pour it out like honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's quite an incredible consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different from these two
consistencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more like a butter on the left
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this one, over here is more like a,
I wouldn't, well, shatter really when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hot, it's super pulley and taffy,
but when it gets cold, it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is almost like a distal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very saucy and liquidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it stays like that always.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't change no matter if you don't
keep it cold or you heat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is some five star bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like kind of like standard hash,
but with a nice orangey, uh, amber
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to show a close up to these each
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Los gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then a couple of more,
uh, bubble hashes that have been whipped,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and almost made to look like rosin,
uh, also done by grateful heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our carb caps that we've
kind of gone over already quite a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got a little bit of a tilt to
the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you spin it on top of the banger,
it creates directional flow and it'll move
[SPEAKER_00]: the rosin or the bubble hash or the,
you know, solvent dabs that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're hitting,
uh, it'll move it around evenly around the
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sides of the quartz banger,
you'll get a better hit that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't cool down certain spots and
leave other spots warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's also a titanium one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really hit on titanium anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a combination titanium base with a
quartz bowl that screws into the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I haven't really hit with that one in
quite a while either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, over here I have a D nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's quite special because this
one's silicone carbide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is also plugged into a titanium
base, but the top itself can be either
[SPEAKER_00]: quartz, a quartz piece like this,
um, a sapphire piece like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really the top notch in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you why I think so in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then silicone carbide,
which is great for traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely, extremely, uh,
tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then the whip on this one and the
coil is quite a bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see it wrapping around the
banger on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually flat and it's a circle like
a, like an element and the post goes right
[SPEAKER_00]: through and the top screws on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all along the bottom of this,
almost like a stove top element.
[SPEAKER_00]: So love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the carb cap that goes with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fits really quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's also got a directional,
um, piece, uh, drilled in here,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a tiny little hole drilled in at an
angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that is actually, and the
reason all of these are directional is not
[SPEAKER_00]: just to move the oil itself around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing I don't have on the
table that I'm going to talk about today
[SPEAKER_00]: are these little orbs or spheres and they
make them out of Ruby and they make them
[SPEAKER_00]: out of sapphire and they make them out of
quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure they make them out of
silicone carbide and probably they even
[SPEAKER_00]: make them out of, um, sapphire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe I said that one already.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they're little orbs, little tiny
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put one inside your banger and now
that acts as a mechanism that when you get
[SPEAKER_00]: that wind going and you start moving
anything or everything around,
[SPEAKER_00]: that hot little orb also peels the resin
and moves it around the base of the
[SPEAKER_00]: banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in time, you're probably
asking yourself, are these people
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously into this, this much that he
actually knows about this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: subject right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, uh, we are and I do, and,
uh, it's something you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: familiarize yourself with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is one of the main ways that we
are, um, consuming, uh, products that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to, that we have produced out of
our lab and that we are going to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce out of our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it is a big part of the culture that
already exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it would be great,
uh, for you guys to have a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of all of this and any
questions you have whatsoever,
[SPEAKER_00]: please reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we can send them off in an email chain
and we can get them all sort of answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I went over everything pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we spoke very little about this unit
because I didn't bring the power source
[SPEAKER_00]: out, but it's really quite simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it conducts heat by sitting
on the courts where there's a heater
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the courts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this little bit of metal conducts heat
enough to get the banger up to temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can pull it away from and not
have any connection, but not having used a
[SPEAKER_00]: torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very innovative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done by a quite a young guy down in
Washington, him and his partner are
[SPEAKER_00]: engineers and they're just thinking
outside of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that they're thinking outside
of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the company is called Mr.
Hotbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are just selling these right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it hasn't really caught on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm one of the first people to
really use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we can go over a whole variety of ways
in the future on how you can dab without
[SPEAKER_00]: these particular units, because there's an
entire industry that involves the switch
[SPEAKER_00]: and the puff go peak and a whole variety
of other units that are not glass pipes
[SPEAKER_00]: with bangers like this, but have created a
unique aspect of almost like the electric
[SPEAKER_00]: pen turned into the electric bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for now I will leave you all possibly
with one last bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes sense to hit the coffee,
which is the lowest gardens, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: organically regeneratively, sustainably
grown, uh, outdoors in, um, Ontario,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I also love that hash of this
quality was produced, uh, outdoors in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I bid you all a good evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: May the full melt bless your dab rig
sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
