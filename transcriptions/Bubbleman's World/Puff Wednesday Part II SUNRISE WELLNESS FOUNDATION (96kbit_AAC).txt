[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome back to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never went anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny and I felt terrible about the last
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're downtown in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to get something to squish.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were both running low on nuggets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I squished all the bud Darren gave me the
other day into a beautiful blob of rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we're down at the Sunrise Wellness
Foundation here with Max and Dom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the development application on
the wall here that shows that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to change of use from retail store
to medical marijuana related use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one of the things our city of
Vancouver is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to give these licenses out
for people to be able to do business in
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fantastically happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they actually have about six license in
Vancouver now that have been approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're having is legal weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go buy some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really in a sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a federal law.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really make it legal in a
sense, but it makes it so the city isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: going to come down and send the police.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the federal government still considers
this completely illegal and they could
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially send the federal police.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at this point in time it hasn't
happened and we're pretty stoked with this
[SPEAKER_02]: step as it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we head in and check out what
they've got at the Sunrise Wellness
[SPEAKER_02]: Foundation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you one of the things about this
place is the quality is on point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in Vancouver this is going to be
that place that has the quality that we
[SPEAKER_03]: look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's head in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go grab some nugs.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk right in and Johnny B is already
behind the counter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm in the mirror too.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don, thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to step outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't be behind here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where the staff is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to be a bud tender, but instead
I'm going to consume your best buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to step outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand beside you in the mirror.
Hey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Johnny and I came by today thinking we
would look at some of the kind nuggets
[SPEAKER_02]: that you guys are often known for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something in regards to a nice flavor,
a really uplift thing or heavy,
[SPEAKER_02]: both of the effects are good for us,
but something that squishes really nice
[SPEAKER_02]: because we know Johnny B is going to be
squishing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be getting busy on that
Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I squish pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a nug, I squish it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it doesn't return, I don't squish it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go through some of the flavors here
just in the Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Miyamore, some Hindu Star,
some Diamond OG, and some Bruce Banner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got going on here,
Don?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few exclusive strains as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only find them here at Sunrise
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from the OGK Labs, these three.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that we've done the phenose
selection ourselves on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all got 09 Cookies crossed into
them, which is the burner's cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a Gorilla Glue 4 crossed with 09
Cookies, which is known as Gorilla Cooks
[SPEAKER_00]: or Glue Cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few different names it goes by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show you some of the nugs there in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one up is Teflon, which is Cherry
Pie crossed with Wi-Fi Alien OG crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: with 09 Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Cherry Pie really comes through with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got nice kind of purpley nugs to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful little bud structure,
little nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third from the OGK Labs, which are
grown by Sunrise Gardens, is the 09
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically 09 Cookies back crossed
into itself with the Wi-Fi Alien.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even through the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks very kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth is the Platinum Girl Scout
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Dark Heart Nursery Cut crossed
with Wi-Fi 43.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both pretty legendary strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the phenose selection on this one
and we think it's definitely a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a few more rounds to go to perfect it,
but so far the response has been pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to show you just a few buds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grab my gloves before I touch
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 09 Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell loud?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some loudness to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a screen down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's warm enough that you're going to have
to take someone out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 09 is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real nice thin wax and cuticle
on it too, so I think it would make a
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice hash strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it would sift well, but I'm sure
if you're just squishing it for rosin,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be quite happy with that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially the Teflon as well if you're
looking for terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for something really
heavy though, I'd probably recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Glue Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grilled glue is common down in the States,
but it's something kind of new up here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone up here wants to go for the glue,
the cookies, and everything, while you
[SPEAKER_00]: hear from all the Americans, they're
always looking at pink cushions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a very common strain to us,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Gorilla.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's the Cooks.
This one's
[SPEAKER_02]: the Gorilla Cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one you had before, that was the
Gorilla Cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the 09.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is the 09.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Teflon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just by looking at the first three,
I'm going to say the Teflon Charity Pie
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross is a definite winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for terps as well as
yield, I only pressed it on a hard press,
[SPEAKER_00]: which doesn't have the same pressure as a
Sasquatch, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were still getting 15%, and that was
just with a lot getting stuck in our bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it just doesn't have the same
pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't use any bags yesterday when I
pressed that seven grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just made it long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a hot dog and just went smash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's the best, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another technique that I've heard people
do is squishing it with a bag and then
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting it and then putting it in a
bag, so they can squish at a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature once they do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I'm going with Teflon so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, anything with that cherry pie in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say the best two for you guys to
squish would be the Gorilla Cooks and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Teflon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all righty then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get those going for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good on you, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe ... I don't even buy ...
It's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what makes it so just so
awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been lacking on the grown
this year and I don't have the quality
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm missing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is getting close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you even be right on par?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we try and definitely always raise
the standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all about quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to compromise at any level
of our products, even our five dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take, say, the Time Warp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burns clean, tastes good, it's got turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a greenhouse strain, but you don't
have to worry about spending five dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: a gram on a strain here that's going to
get you sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time Warp is also known, for me,
is also a Haley's common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, because when you grow it indoors,
it tends to change into that, doesn't it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very lovely, very lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some superior strains you guys got going
on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said a quarter of each,
but I'm just going to split the two
[SPEAKER_00]: quarters between these three, because I
think all three of these are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice squishers, all very different
in flavor as well, because you'll have the
[SPEAKER_00]: Teflon for the share.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just upsold me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I think you need all three.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're still getting the same amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same amount, I'm just going to split
between these three, because I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: you to miss out on the 09 Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: John's like, give me a quarter of each.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll split it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're awesome, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stock can be a little bit,
you know, over...
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that, he would take the stock out
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to give you too much stick
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just squishing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the best nugs for squishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Squishy nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, John, you'll roll some joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty much like, you know,
a nice little... I rolled into a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: little log.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd probably smoke a joint, but for me,
it's on both the extractions, and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what really helps for me, what I really
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like kind of like smoking one of
these big joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to smoke that joint for like 20
minutes before you feel anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're ready to do one little dab and
you're set.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ready to do one little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, woohoo!
[SPEAKER_00]: This is rocking the Blue Rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got quite a selection of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue River Turpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss Tsunami, Cabello Sour Diesel,
Black Line Reserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I get people asking me all the time
where to get Turpenes in the city,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I tell them this is pretty much the
one shop that I have sold Turpenes to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to wait for the
shipping, come into the Sunrise and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: pick them up the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above the packaging, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so these are all BPA-free,
craft paper, recycled craft paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, you know, they're pretty smelly-proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually pretty similar to the Blue
River kind of packaging, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smelly-proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you got med-tainers sitting over
there, too, with your logo on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic med-tainers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are great for people who've got sore
wrists because it's much easier to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: onto than one of those small little
grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue River heads, you've got everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you've got to have some hash,
bubble hash, right behind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've got a few different ones in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some nice Rosins in there from
Concentrated X, some
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry-banana-flower Rosin,
but that flew off the shelf within the
[SPEAKER_00]: first day of getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have some of this Dry Sift Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some nice Heavenly Days Live
Resins there if you're into all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: types of extractions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're covering all the gamuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we try to cover everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we like to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to see access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is a quiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to put only one shot in
your quiver when you can fill that quiver
[SPEAKER_02]: right up with all the cultivars and all
the extractions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty excited right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's nice to be able to come to a
shop that actually has some dank nug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do take credit cards, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We take debit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't take credit yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to stay ahead of the curve
with just the debit machine here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, pretty much, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing is being able to take
cannabis at a level where we're actually
[SPEAKER_03]: able to start purchasing it on that scale,
I think, with the application being on the
[SPEAKER_03]: wall and how the licensing is here
happening in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really looking forward to being able
to come into these establishments,
[SPEAKER_03]: purchase legally, rec, and medical,
and be able to use whatever it takes
[SPEAKER_03]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'd be a wonder if we could actually
get our insurance to cover it for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the next level right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're laughing that that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it comes down to access,
and it comes down to patients' rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people have their
prescriptions paid for.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to purchase their
pharmaceutical drugs for their conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone like myself and a lot of
others use cannabis for their conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why do we have to purchase our
medication when it's needed every day for
[SPEAKER_03]: general well-being, for homeostasis,
is what I say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel better every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's got it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: He even knows the color.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, nope, that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's half the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely got a very nice cakey nose to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really, really am a
connoisseur of cushions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't have this in my garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have these flavors available to me
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I'll be able to access them
sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd say I am accessing them right
now here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't spend three months growing or
curing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know the quality is definitely
exactly what I would actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: accustomed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're excited to have them on our
shelves because it's been a project that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been working on for a better part of
a year now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know the strains because these are
some of the strains that I had popped at
[SPEAKER_03]: the beginning of the year, which was what
you guys would call the tough on the chair
[SPEAKER_03]: pie crust of the overnight cookies was a
strain that I started working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And due to the fact that I went for some
surgeries and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to kind of wait a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being able to try it right now when I
was getting ready to grow it is just,
[SPEAKER_03]: for me, it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a couple of people,
maybe less than five people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice to see the differences
between the few growers that have them
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're all doing slightly
different methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are done aeroponically and
under cavitas, whereas I know another
[SPEAKER_00]: mutual friend of ours has them in a small
little tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he creates some very, very high
quality, fully organic, and gorgeous
[SPEAKER_00]: looking, almost like diamonds on the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you definitely see the difference
when using organics compared to when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing like, what do you say,
a current culture system, a water system,
[SPEAKER_03]: where they're using synthetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with any kind of proper flush,
anyone who knows what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really not that hard to figure out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I split it up like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that working?
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to grab some too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, do you know what you want to try?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to try some other ones or the
same ones that Johnny got?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you want some more of that Gorilla
Cooks because you enjoyed that last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let me see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll probably get like,
so far you don't have the platinum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe a little bit of the platinum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunrise cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do the platinum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Teflon 09 and Gorilla Cooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely want some Teflon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want to see the results of
these squishes because I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, film it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably squish them all in one shot too,
like three squishes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the four piles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since I was able to just
go to a dispensary and buy some herb,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really done this in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gone to coffee shops in
Amsterdam in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got those things out of my system
in the 90s and I was a part of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, supplying the compassion club
back in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early 2000s and late 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice as well for me who doesn't
have any plants growing right now to just
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to come down and pick up close to
a zip of some buds and take them home and
[SPEAKER_02]: squish them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some nice resin for the next Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, just going to pay my bill here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My delicious, delicious flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one last thing we wanted to mention was
that you guys have a Christmas giveaway
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're doing a little holiday
giveaway in collaboration with High
[SPEAKER_00]: Enterity Glass Art.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's definitely someone to look up to if
you're into high-end glass and collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done this in collaboration with
them and for the first prize place,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the first place you're going to
see it on Puff Wednesday, is we've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothership Mini brand new with an XL
frosted OFC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say throw that lighter
up next to it so they can actually get an
[SPEAKER_02]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is miniature and obviously it comes
with the laser cut turtle case with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothership logo on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, the XL maintainer is even bigger
than the Mini.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to crack that open and let's
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's laser cut, so it's made
specifically for your Mini.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whoever's lucky enough to win this will
have a pretty awesome case to go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, this is a nice little pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looks so clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's even ever had water in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came pretty much straight from
Mothership to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is second prize?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is second place prize and it will
come with a fresh swing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the exact color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's got a blue stardust,
maybe a bit of cobalt in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even green stardust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on which way you look at it
through the light, you're getting quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: few different shades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do people get entered to win
such a thing here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's open to in-store customers or our
mail order customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically for every $200, they spend
per order, they get a raffle entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is running for almost two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got lots of opportunities to come
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep a complete tally of it on our
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically right around Christmas,
someone will be the lucky winner of either
[SPEAKER_00]: the first or second prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the third prize, we've got a bunch
of different Mothership accessories,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little dad rag, a dad mat, like little
non-sticks like that, a bunch of stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got lots and lots of collectible
Mothership calendars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which have tons of really cool of their
pieces inside of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, January for the win.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait for my phone call just before
Christmas.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: might win.
[SPEAKER_02]: I entered because I of course... Could be
a Puff Wednesday celebration right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I gotta say, part of me really hopes
that someone that doesn't own a
[SPEAKER_02]: Mothership...
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, of course we want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just mean I would hope that someone who
never owned a Mothership in their life...
[SPEAKER_02]: Gets a chance to win it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, let's wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a really nice little time here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B., you got some flavors?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both got flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Dom for walking us through
as always.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be more, there may not be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, this was more than you thought
you were going to get this Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunrise Wellness Foundation, one on
Kingsway, one on Broadway?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 258 West Broadway or 2943
Kingsway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part two of this will be me squishing
the nuggets that I bought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that won't be a Puff Wednesday,
but it'll be kind of a continued Sunrise
[SPEAKER_02]: Wellness Nugget Squish video.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, right on guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you soon.
See you next time.
