[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bubble Man here on a beautiful British
Columbian morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm about to head up to the Brandywine,
just south of Whistler, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_14]: do some sledding today, and I'm kind of
excited to bring you guys along with me.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I figured I'd start the day with a bong
rip, got some sweet skunk for breakfast.
[SPEAKER_14]: From the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to do a b-line rip.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I got my bong loaded here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Little ruer action for the morning,
so.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wake and bakey.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go brapping.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, guys, so here's my gear for the
day.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got snowmobile boots, full face
helmet, snowboarding boots, camera,
[SPEAKER_14]: hemp hoodlum hat, bong, trippy stick,
tripod, GoPro, snowboard, custom gift from
[SPEAKER_14]: my buddy Nico.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, of course, most importantly,
we've got our shovel, our probe,
[SPEAKER_14]: and the Ortovox transponder.
[SPEAKER_14]: Transceiver, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't come into the back country without
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, of course, most importantly,
[SPEAKER_14]: we have the sled.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's in the graphics, not on top.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bubble man, custom Solomon.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, I made it into the truck here,
and man, there's a lot of things to
[SPEAKER_14]: remember to go sledding.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had forgotten my sled.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sled ramp, which wouldn't have made it
impossible.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can always get the sled off the truck
easy enough.
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually, you can get it on pretty good,
too, with a snowbank, but definitely not
[SPEAKER_14]: my idea of fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've grabbed my ramp.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've grabbed all my helmets and goggles
and gloves, extra gloves.
[SPEAKER_14]: I grabbed the Swiss perk for doing
watermelon bong rips up on the top of
[SPEAKER_14]: Brandywine Mountain.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to check all that out.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to head down through Squamish
right now into Whistler.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, just before Whistler, we're going to
turn in at the Callahan.
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess the sliding center is up there.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go left off the highway and
into Brandywine Park, meet our buddies,
[SPEAKER_14]: meet the crew, and then make our way up to
the top of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_14]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get a good feeling, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get a good feeling, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get a good feeling, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I get a good feeling, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I get a good feeling, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: so yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah Down to Porto Cove about 15,
about 20 minutes from Horseshoe Bay and
[SPEAKER_14]: it's actually a well-known dive spot here
in British Columbia a lot of people dive
[SPEAKER_14]: right out there pretty cool that's the
Pacific Ocean, the Howe Sound and next
[SPEAKER_14]: we'll come across Furry Creek and Furry
Creek is where they filmed part of the
[SPEAKER_14]: movie Happy Gilmore if you ever saw the
scene where Bob Barker and Adam Sandler
[SPEAKER_14]: had it out they fought each other Bob
Barker kicked the shit out of Adam Sandler
[SPEAKER_14]: that happened just beside the highway up
here so I'll make sure I show you guys
[SPEAKER_12]: that spot as well there's the hole that
Bob and Adam fought on out by the water
[SPEAKER_12]: there that's the golf course that's right
where the fight happened pretty hilarious
[SPEAKER_14]: small town of Britannia this is mining
town right right even with ocean level
[SPEAKER_14]: real beautiful little zone anyone that's
ever driven up to Whistler has definitely
[SPEAKER_14]: gone through here you can't get to
Whistler without it and yeah basically
[SPEAKER_14]: it's about 10 minutes outside of Squamish
there's the mine right there it's the
[SPEAKER_14]: entrance to the mine anyway they still
have like the big-ass truck on display a
[SPEAKER_14]: few other things a lot of movies are
filmed in this little zone in the
[SPEAKER_14]: Britannia mine museum and you can see
across the way there is the glacier
[SPEAKER_14]: alright heading close into Squamish we'll
see the black tusk diamond head sorry
[SPEAKER_14]: there's the diamond head up there and
there's the big chief a big round sort of
[SPEAKER_14]: smaller mountain is actually one of the
second largest single pieces of granite in
[SPEAKER_14]: North America possibly the world you'll
have to Google that that's called the
[SPEAKER_14]: chief and it's in Squamish very popular
amongst our rock climbing culture they
[SPEAKER_14]: really dig it if you want to check out a
good video on the chief check out zombies
[SPEAKER_14]: woof it's actually zombies roof named
after a Frank Zappa song and it's a very
[SPEAKER_14]: technical very difficult short climb that
can be done right here at the chief around
[SPEAKER_14]: this corner just before Squamish and just
at the base of the chief you can see the
[SPEAKER_14]: chief how substantial it is now as we pull
up to it you can see rock climbers would
[SPEAKER_14]: love it we have Shannon Falls if you're
coming up this way it's always worth
[SPEAKER_14]: stopping here for a puff Shannon Falls
Provincial Park and it's actually got a
[SPEAKER_14]: pretty substantial waterfall it's winter
so the waterfall is not going to be
[SPEAKER_14]: kicking very strong right now but it'll
definitely be kicking and I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_14]: what kind of height we have on Shannon
Falls but that's another thing you can
[SPEAKER_14]: check out on your Google and then brand
new right past Shannon Falls right at the
[SPEAKER_14]: base of the chief we have a new gondola
going in I'm not sure if this is called
[SPEAKER_14]: the Squamish gondola but this is all
literally brand new not even finished and
[SPEAKER_14]: that gondola goes right up there to a zone
that has otherwise been unaccessible
[SPEAKER_14]: coming up to the chief the Stalwumus chief
and you can see that that's a substantial
[SPEAKER_14]: mountain for climbing great face all sorts
of features and no matter what your level
[SPEAKER_14]: is you'll find a challenge here at the
Stalwumus chief we're going to continue on
[SPEAKER_14]: in through the Garibaldi through the
Tantalus Range we're going to pass Black
[SPEAKER_14]: Tusk Diamond Head Black Tusk and yeah
we'll keep you posted hope you guys are
[SPEAKER_05]: enjoying this ride yeah yeah yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

perk.

[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get busy here.
[SPEAKER_14]: What a beautiful day in British Columbia,
hanging out with my friends, sledding,
[SPEAKER_14]: bong ripping, eating great food.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what I do most of the time when
I'm not actually making hash or out at
[SPEAKER_14]: events and promoting dry sifting and wet
washing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty much in these zones that you
see right here doing these things that
[SPEAKER_14]: we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see the snow right now is
extremely deep.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's trenched out for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: My sled over there.
[SPEAKER_14]: My machine.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the one that gets you where you need
to be.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well that's what we call an epic day here
in V.C.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not over yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna go do some hot tubbing,
eat some epic food.
[SPEAKER_14]: Smoke some wonderful hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just Whistler.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're really truly, I know the word epic
is overused, but come to Whistler and try
[SPEAKER_14]: not to use it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I dare you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get busy here.
