[SPEAKER_08]: Please be seated.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are few chairs still available.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sound is OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Video is OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's quite clear Mr. Nice has
entered the building.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Nice, by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Marks.
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your trip, Your Excellency?
[SPEAKER_06]: Inventful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Inventful, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seemed to be endless.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very good to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very good to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we are very happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have missed part of the ceremony
already.
I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the prize is in good hands,
I can assure you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I will give the word to Ben.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's better now, in a way.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, first we roll tape.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, can we roll tape?
And I guarantee with everything that I
hold dear that I would destroy any
[SPEAKER_05]: argument they would present for
maintaining the illegality of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: A physicist graduate of Oxford.
[SPEAKER_01]: A philosophy graduate of Sussex.
[SPEAKER_01]: A teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: An MI6 agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A drug smuggler.
[SPEAKER_01]: A prisoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: A writer.
[SPEAKER_01]: A DJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: This extraordinary and prominent
personality is extremely valuable to the
[SPEAKER_01]: good cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legalisation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please stand up and tell us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Explain to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Explain to the world effectively.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please explain to the world precisely what
hashish is and why it should be made
[SPEAKER_05]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Marks, before we do any summary,
I still believe that you want to say
[SPEAKER_08]: something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm so happy and so proud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're one of the people who make
me high.
That's the thing, you know.
I think it's nice.
I was thinking about it.
I mean, we got a bunch of cons,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And last year we had the politicians.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful people, actually, in the heart.
[SPEAKER_07]: We hated him, really.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a prime minister.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I love the man, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the winner once.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a school in the game, but not the
game itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were rascals.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was right to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we felt like we couldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I admire in the US.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm sure I smoked before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I started smoking when I was 17.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure it was sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when I met him, we met in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right away, in a click.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the same kind of wood.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's probably the activists,
the old wood.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need the new wood.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're coming up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we planted the seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We planted the seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only the seeds on the ground,
the flower, but we planted the seeds in
[SPEAKER_07]: the mines.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean, I was really just involved in
smuggling.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, now I've become interested in
drawing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I smuggled from where it was to where
it wasn't.
Apparently, your first arrest wasn't at
your house?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was shortly after the Paradiso.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think within a few days, 1972,
I was arrested with about this much of
[SPEAKER_06]: passion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very small amount.
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you serve?
[SPEAKER_08]: How long did you serve?
[SPEAKER_06]: I served very little because I skipped
bail.
[SPEAKER_06]: A few days in the Dutch prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a few days, a few weeks in the British
prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I just disappeared on the run.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we have discussed the German before.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one question from the public.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've asked already.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all discussed the German.
[SPEAKER_08]: Has prison learned you anything?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yes.
It did?
Yes, it did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think I emerged a far better
person as a result of my prison sentence
[SPEAKER_06]: than the person who had to end.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you elaborate on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just learned to, I suppose, look after
people less fortunate than myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's a certain spirituality
and strength in doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned to help people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned to care about people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I was just a little man and
smuggling and living the high life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a real opportunity.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you had a special process.
[SPEAKER_08]: You seem to be highly educated as compared
to probably the majority of the Indians.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've been blessed with a high
education, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was more sort of helping people
reduce their sentences or to learn how to
[SPEAKER_06]: read.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a set up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was mainly just to help them read.
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, as a reminder from the film
and also from reading your biography,
[SPEAKER_08]: quite late, you became aware of the mass
scale, not so much when you knew you were
[SPEAKER_08]: in the business, but also how it was
received by young people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's quite true.
[SPEAKER_06]: It became quite a big deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite a big smuggler.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I lost touch with the streets quite a
lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I came out of prison, I was very,
very surprised as to the prevalence of
[SPEAKER_06]: smuggling by the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was a young, it was almost a
privilege of middle-class academics to be
[SPEAKER_06]: smuggled by the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the postmen smuggled it, the plumbers
smuggled it, everyone smuggled it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a big bourgeoisie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's commonplace.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very comforting to see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally very surprised.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, as you may be aware of,
I saw a very nice clip of a movie that you
[SPEAKER_08]: are producing or you are all with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody should see this clip,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think now it's on all Twitter feeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: You start in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least you imply it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a movie, I think you don't get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the movie about?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: The movie is about all aspects of
cannabis, really, and of course the
[SPEAKER_06]: freedom that only exists in Amsterdam,
really.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Less and less.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've heard about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then things will swing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as I can say, in the 70s,
Amsterdam is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm both happy and a wee sick.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the situation in England nowadays,
I mean, what is the situation?
[SPEAKER_06]: The situation, I suppose, is going in a
different direction from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a way, Amsterdam is getting more tight.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, there was Britain is getting less
tight right now, which in a way is a
[SPEAKER_06]: comfort for me to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's fitting for less people to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: What?
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I ask for them to talk about this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, can we ask about it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you aware, by the way, about the
controversy in Holland about something
[SPEAKER_08]: with peace, black peace, etc.?
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you heard about black peace,
etc.?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we ask three people to ask this thing?
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, the magical moment
has arisen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's working.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need many words.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know my feeling about what's going on
between us.
[SPEAKER_07]: As an award winner, like Mark,
I just told you before here, all these
[SPEAKER_07]: things are from my heart.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, really far, you know,
deep in my heart, I love you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have so much connection together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they ask me why you do these
culture awards, I've told people,
[SPEAKER_07]: well, this is a museum.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in a hundred years, I think they'll
remember you in a thousand years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we inspired the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: You inspired me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We inspire each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in that sense, I thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got this award with you and me.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just the one thing I want to do.
Something else.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to do it now, too?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm going to do it now, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to do it immediately?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a guy, and you've seen it already.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drum and bass, is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Drum and bass.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this guy, he made a beautiful art
piece about Howard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this place, you know, the museum
bought it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a masterpiece to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to be the museum of your
choice here or in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my own ideas, but you know,
I give it to you, whatever you want it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to show it to the public
now, because I think it's a great piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it will be in any museum.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it has to hang from up and down,
because you will be in the museum for the
[SPEAKER_07]: rest of the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think also we had a musical intermezzo
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody dancing, but I don't know if she
is around.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a few questions, by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Martin.
[SPEAKER_08]: The public found this question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not so slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stone, stone, stone, stone, stone,
stone.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the whole schedule has been
rearranged.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was expecting also some music.
No,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I really think.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no,
[SPEAKER_09]: no.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no.
No, no, no,
no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no,
no.
No, no, no,
no.
No, no,
no, no.
No, no,
no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no, no,
no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no,
no.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, apparently, apparently,
apparently, and I was quite shocked to
[SPEAKER_08]: hear this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, you are flying back in half an
hour or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, Mr. Marx will be here for
another half an hour, giving us half an
[SPEAKER_08]: hour time frame to ask him some questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the people in the public that are
dying to ask Mr. Marx a question,
[SPEAKER_08]: they can come forward or they can raise
their fingers.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no censorship.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no censorship.
[SPEAKER_08]: My question to you is, considering the
fact that things are going less smooth or
[SPEAKER_08]: at least than before, what is your
expectation for the near future concerning
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis worldwide?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think generally it is heading in the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm very surprised and pleasantly
surprised as to how well it's heading in
[SPEAKER_06]: cases like America, which is the last
place I thought would be leading the way
[SPEAKER_06]: in any sort of way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm particularly interested in the
curative effects of cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the medical stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also, of course, completely satisfied
with this recreation and things should
[SPEAKER_06]: never be underestimated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've just been generally positive
about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel depressed about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that things are globally,
even though Holland, I know there's a bit
[SPEAKER_06]: of a flip now, which is irritating,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But generally, worldwide, it is going in
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel.
What do you miss about the old days the
most?
Like if you could think something about
cannabis from the 60s or 70s, what do you
miss the most?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you don't see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just the wonderful stuff we get
in the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, can you lower your voice,
get me back, please?
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss the wonderful house that existed in
the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's less now.
[SPEAKER_08]: The quality went down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the house, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The quality of the Marilana went up,
certainly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the quality of the house didn't seem
to preserve its magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think that's attributed to?
I think you say that they've certainly
observed it.
What happened?
What happened to the temple balls and the
nephews of the Golden Age?
[SPEAKER_06]: What changed all that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think a lot got overtaken by the
sort of tremendous botanical advances they
[SPEAKER_06]: made in growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that THC became more accepted.
[SPEAKER_06]: People became used to a higher grade of
THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think at the expense of particular
hashes, it was inevitable in a way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in many ways, Morocco can be
blamed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because before 1972, there was no hashes
in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it became close to you,
then the whole thing changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: The wonderful house was lost.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's still there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get there in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you dab now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you done dabs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I've done dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done everything.
I'd like to say something about it as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the state of mind, how do you say
it?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a good hand, you join it and
you fly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the togetherness of the whole.
And you are a real traditional good hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: You fly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I miss a bit, you know,
with the dabbing, because I dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I miss is the high, is the up to
rise.
[SPEAKER_07]: And somehow it is the spirit.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you smoke a good hash or a good weed in
this mountain, you're getting high.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're getting in a group with the social
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're smoking the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for me, that is something like really
holy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not to get the real, real extra
to go with the elevated up to 28,
[SPEAKER_07]: 4, and go down.
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, it's like the entourage of good
money, money, and good hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that people should keep that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you can jab, dab, and dab,
and dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then there's what?
[SPEAKER_07]: To dab what?
To what?
I have a completely other question.
[SPEAKER_08]: It suddenly comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: The fiction film, Mr. Nice, the film
itself, which I really enjoyed,
[SPEAKER_08]: which I really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think that it could be that this
fiction film has had any influence on
spirit?
Winning hearts and minds, or how do you
consider it?
What was it?
How does it have any influence?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a strange thing, because it only
covers a small part of my life,
[SPEAKER_06]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, a film would last a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in all fairness, it was
concentrated on the landmarks of my life,
[SPEAKER_06]: in a sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: And therefore, it's a good movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not a docudrama.
It's a movie.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But do you think that it somehow helped,
or at least did it have any influence on
[SPEAKER_08]: the?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, did it have any influence on your
life, or did it change anything for you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Except that it made you more famous?
[SPEAKER_06]: It made me more famous, and it increased
my bookstores for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you liked the movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoyed it, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think anyone would like a movie made
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the actor actually somehow really
resembled you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to have a drug-taking competition
in Glastonbury every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we knew each other terribly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Glastonbury every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to just take loads of drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd not just come.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just loads.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I won every one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we didn't have to study.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd known each other for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's also very good to have someone
play you sort of taller, better looking,
[SPEAKER_06]: and younger.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to sit with the?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Howard, thanks for making it over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great honor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read the biography of that observer
general.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been into you previously.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like if you could say something
about the paradox of your life in that
[SPEAKER_04]: you've made your money and you've made
your fame by cannabis being illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: In retrospect, looking back, would you
rather that it had been made legal in the
[SPEAKER_04]: 70s?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if so, what would you have done with
your life?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've always approved, I've always
fought for the legalization of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: even though I made my money from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I thought with just my cable,
the sunset, soon it will be legalized.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, people who have funeral directors
don't hope that people die.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: But given that you came to Oxford,
would you have gone into the city,
[SPEAKER_04]: or would you have become an advertising
executive?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I certainly wouldn't have done
either of those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have become an academic,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have become an elected philosophy
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God for the comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God for that, eh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, is it really necessary that
you leave now tonight?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, why can't I just stay?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is, because my daughter is
visiting me tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: She only sees me one day or these days.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's very precious to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a question about, again, the clip for
his film you should check.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's with the dwarfs?
[SPEAKER_06]: The dwarfs, the ones in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have the clip here?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a place in Manila called the
Hobbit House, which is where the
[SPEAKER_06]: entertainment is done by dwarfs.
[SPEAKER_06]: The service is done by dwarfs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, every aspect of the hospitality is
done by the dwarfs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I found it amusing and an elected
place.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is where this is filmed, this scene.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the scene in the clip.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a clip where you say,
welcome to Amsterdam, where the grass is
[SPEAKER_08]: green.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember that.
And your body is very strong.
With the dwarfs?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it out of the fiction film?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it out of the fiction film?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is this clip?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are they?
[SPEAKER_08]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and I'm all back from the film.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a film about dwarfs, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was asked if I would be... I was asked
if I would play a film.
[SPEAKER_06]: The film that is coming out is called
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where a jolly green giant and everything
like that fills this massive plant that
[SPEAKER_06]: blows up the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a crazy film.
[SPEAKER_08]: Start rolling!
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, you say?
[SPEAKER_06]: Start rolling!
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a crazy film.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a storm humor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a wonderful story.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's soon in the cinema near us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Christmas?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, about Christmas.
Oh, Christmas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know we were talking about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just... What?
[SPEAKER_08]: But dwarfs... You know, I said,
I'm very... Well, okay, we're not talking
[SPEAKER_08]: about dwarfs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I made a film about dwarfs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Show us through.
Guys, what are we going to do?
Maybe we should chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't there some champagne?
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be an excellent idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Champagne?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we... I think this is a champagne
moment.
