[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty exciting again here today with new
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going through my seed collection the
other day as I was going to pop these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that Subcool sent me recently and I
was peeling through all these old
[SPEAKER_00]: collections in the fridge and I got down
to the bottom and I found these two
[SPEAKER_00]: particular things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I found an enormous amount of things
in there from the last 20 to 25 years that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking cannabis and collecting
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking hashish I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's been for the last 12 to 13 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collected these particular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have eight seeds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a white seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very light colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tan almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I collected them in 1995 in Negril,
Orange Hill, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Westmoreland, the furthest part of the
Westmoreland area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Hill for any of you that are
familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable ganja and this particular
ganja back then, I remember when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking it, it had made my mouth numb with
how much resin was seeping out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it was sun-grown, tropical
sun-grown resin so it was excellent
[SPEAKER_00]: quality but basically the gentleman who
had passed it to me said that his friend
[SPEAKER_00]: from Eugene, Oregon had brought some
really nice seeds and they had bred them
[SPEAKER_00]: with a local lamb's bread style strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is indeed a lamb's bread hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super excited to crack these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got these little eight seeds and
I'm going to open this container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't opened this little plastic
container for almost 20 years so I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: opening it right now and out come the
seeds onto the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still look like they're in growable
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now also I found from not quite as old but
around 96, 97 there was a strain that used
[SPEAKER_00]: to be quite prevalent back in British
Columbia in Vancouver here called the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was grown to perfection they often
called it the champagne hash plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: this was that LA style lime green bud that
sold itself perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never saw any other grade other than
perfection out of this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was apparently cloned only there was
never seeds available but out of all of it
[SPEAKER_00]: that I ever saw I remember pulling two
seeds out of out of a bud and these two
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are right here with me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to take you through my
method of cracking seeds and we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if it works for 20 year old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had called a couple of different
friends I talked to Matt the great
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener and he told me about a trick that
Soma had told him about about putting
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it into a glass of water which I
had heard about myself as well and letting
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds float and I guess once they sink
you pull them out and you plant them and
[SPEAKER_00]: that means the seals cracked and that
they're ready to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally am just more comfortable for
whatever reason with doing what I always
[SPEAKER_00]: did and I always just did the old paper
the old paper towel and plate moisten the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper towels open it up throw the seeds
inside and then put this in a nice dark
[SPEAKER_00]: place and hope for germination so that's
what we're going to do today here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds look completely different so
there's really no worries on on mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you with the lens there that
some of these seeds are literally white
[SPEAKER_00]: and the couple of hash plant ones are
quite quite a bit darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to put these all in their
little place you know give them a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an excellent thing I found on
seed germination and I'll put the link in
[SPEAKER_00]: the comments I was really impressed with
this this particular post that I found on
[SPEAKER_00]: seed germinating and it really told a lot
of the different stresses that can help
[SPEAKER_00]: increase your numbers of males which
generally isn't something you want so he's
[SPEAKER_00]: giving a list of things to avoid simple
things like you know obviously don't crack
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds and allow them to get a quarter
of an inch to an inch long before you
[SPEAKER_00]: plant them that shocks them and that can
produce males temperature variances can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce males the lack of light he says
that you want your light right above your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil your T5's when those seeds come out
it's good for them to have that light
[SPEAKER_00]: right there if they have to stretch any
amounts if they're falling over this is
[SPEAKER_00]: another thing that can produce males so
I'll go over a couple of these things in
[SPEAKER_00]: the upcoming videos that I do about these
particular seeds and we'll let you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of female ratio we we get
because we've just cracked yeah so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: eight and two so we're going to have ten
seeds total not a high number of seeds by
[SPEAKER_00]: any by any means you think we should get a
solid five five plus females so they've
[SPEAKER_00]: got their place on the on the paper towel
I'm gonna close that paper towel up I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna mist it get it nice and moist and of
course keep it moist don't let it dry out
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a good way to affect your seeds in a
very negative way
[SPEAKER_00]: so we just want to get this nice and wet
through and through not sopping by any
[SPEAKER_00]: means it's still nice and wet and if I
open it up in the middle it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: completely dry in here so we're gonna give
some moisture in there too
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 year old seeds let's see what you got
for us
[SPEAKER_00]: so feel free to you know add your comments
and your tips I know everyone's got a way
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing this and I'm not really promoting
this is the only way to do this by any
[SPEAKER_00]: means but it is the way that I'm the most
comfortable doing it moisten this the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper towel I've got a nice cold not cold
but you know not warm at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: either space for this to be in the dark
and just allow for those seeds to to tap
[SPEAKER_00]: into that natural mechanism of sprouting
once we produce the conditions that it
[SPEAKER_00]: requires really excited Jamaican lamb's
bread hybrid and hash plant stay tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: keep watching bubble man's world and have
a great day hey you you you
