[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to have to mute that right
off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here today with my good buddy John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were thinking today that we were going
to share with you, we don't want to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the proper way to hit a bowl of
full melt, but I guess our proper way,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way we feel like... We feel like a lot
of people are not hitting full melt and
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're torching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: John's noticing this as he's making dry
sift and wet wash these days that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: full melt quality and he's sharing it with
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the Cannabis Cup every year,
which I will be at in a couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: November 24th to 29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: With John, if you want to come see us at
the booth, we'll be around, walking around
[SPEAKER_00]: and having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people just, they just don't
know how to hit the bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with a bee line, they'll either
suck out the flame and then they get a
[SPEAKER_00]: taste from the smoke off the end of the
bee line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say they don't like bee line
because it leaves a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really supposed to burn the bee
line out and inhale the smoke from the bee
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to use the flame as your
sort of wafting tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do a little video for
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my macro lens, so I'll do some,
sort of showing you what we're doing from
[SPEAKER_00]: a distance and then I'll try to put it in
as well clips of us close up of just
[SPEAKER_00]: gently the process of what we're doing to
hit the bong properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, I would begin with
depending on what bong you're hitting,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be a learning curve
because every bong perks differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bongs, it's almost like a horsepower
of a car that's just really strong and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to take off very slowly
without screeching the wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bongs are just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you give them the time tiniest
little bit of suction and they just,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water goes up to your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll suck the flame out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before taking a hit, sometimes it's not
a bad idea to just feel the perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel the perk of the bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step one, you know, just suss it out
before you hold a flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's hitting a roer treating yourself
edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting a mothership straight fab and
they both perk quite differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not hit his bong the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hit this one anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a lot slower, deeper chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that one there, I love that bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I use whenever I puff Medi
Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've got a giant jar here of some
Fomalt Kush bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably about 30 grams here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, John's got his superb
quality that we made on our last video
[SPEAKER_00]: that we posted making a fresh frozen whole
plant extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, let's have a smell of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: 120, 90, 73.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how it works so well for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's load ourselves a bowl here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do a little, a little bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when puffing something like that,
you can see how small it's all I ever
[SPEAKER_01]: really use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing a big rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a, yeah, it gets right down to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said the quality is so good that you
don't really need to put like 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lid back on that using our skill
tools here that can come in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a little bit difficult to
just big fingers, kind of trying to grab
[SPEAKER_00]: little pieces of half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect little tools when dealing with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect little tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got about 15 of them actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never run out of tools when it comes
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can find that lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lighter is sitting right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let us light our d lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both hitting the beeline today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to say this is the only
way to hit a bowl, but this is what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cordless units like the Ember
ceramic heater that is also a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's electric nails and there's
sublimators and all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about over time, but today
we're talking beeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think John and I both have a similar
technique when it comes to the beeline,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a wafting the flame gently over
the bubble, allowing it to melt,
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting it and then letting it melt for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hold the flame too long,
those volatile terpenes, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: are just destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're never really appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the more gently you waft
your flame over the resin and the less
[SPEAKER_00]: direct contact, the more flavor and taste
is going to come through in that hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the guys who are doing a lot
of dabbing with sublimators and e-nails
[SPEAKER_00]: and D-nails and such, are also finding the
same thing that when you bring those
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures down, it's a world of
difference compared to the young guy who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just first time torching the nail orange
hot and then dropping bubble on his nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people used to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short video.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to sit here and do some more
puffing actually, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were definitely talking about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a little chat with Jody boy
yesterday too, but just proper way to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: a bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proper way just to kind of gently hit the
bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we say proper, it's the way that
seems to be the most efficient and
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a valuable thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just did bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should do some full melt dry sift too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we might do a waft with the dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: This here is actually that product sitting
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Smedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be, well that's an old cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely some dyke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be able to really show it
to you guys, but I'll take a picture and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add it into the video so you can see
the quality of the same thing applies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I find with the dry sift, it's a
little bit quicker than the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I would talk about as I'm
watching John load the just most awesomely
[SPEAKER_00]: huge bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy who grew the herb and the guy who
made the dry sift is the guy who can load
[SPEAKER_00]: huge bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dry sift and load a big bowl for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not the best etiquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, it's not the best
etiquette.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love handing it out to people who truly
need some nice little head of some nice
[SPEAKER_01]: fine medicine and they're really afraid of
smoking a big joint smelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to explain how this is the proper
way of just a nice little perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full melt dry sift following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, this was another video we made
on the tumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see that video as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out, check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just share them with your friends and here
we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a prime example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's a little excited and pulls
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much, much easier to do in the roar
because it's a deep chuggling perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mothership is almost a gentle perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick it up and get it really
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really incredible learning
curve to it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave us some comments and we'll talk to
you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
