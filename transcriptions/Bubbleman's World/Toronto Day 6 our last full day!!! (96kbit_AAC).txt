[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning, Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good afternoon, Ashley.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it afternoon now?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been at it for a little while,
sold some dry sift screens, tracked down
[SPEAKER_04]: some med containers.
[SPEAKER_04]: John and I have had a few meetings with a
few different people, and now we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: graciously invited to a grow somewhere
here in the metropolitan Toronto area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice medical grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, nice medical grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we took them up on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a couple of meetings later on,
but we figured, hey, let's take these guys
[SPEAKER_04]: to a grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you ready to head it or what?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're ready to take you guys out of here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the D-nail packed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bubble hash and the dry sift is in the
pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's ready to go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go jump in a cab and go check this
place out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go check out this place out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you could say that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So John and I have just arrived here at
the grow show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess we're going to knock our way
in here and meet the guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoa, he's right there, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right on, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble man's world in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to take us on a little tour
here.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's just get the right light here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks proper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us a little bit about your show
here, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks great.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a cooperative effort.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a perpetual harvest, obviously.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can see some different weeks going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot of California genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're kind of in a transitional phase.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure everyone else is, in a way,
kind of post-injunction.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had kind of these buildings were
largely empty.
[SPEAKER_13]: The buildings were largely empty.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're having some, you know,
we're just getting back to full speed
[SPEAKER_13]: right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of staking deals with what's going
on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We ran trellises for years and like that
we decided to.
[SPEAKER_13]: Trellises?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had two by twos and trellis,
everything trellised.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we went away with that.
[SPEAKER_13]: We kind of thought it was making a bit of
a campfire.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a canopy that we didn't really want.
[SPEAKER_13]: We wanted some more airflow.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've gone to this different kind of,
we're five weeks into the new staking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like you've got some kush
happening here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I've got some, there's a mix of OG
and candy kush in that section here.
[SPEAKER_13]: These are our medibaba.
[SPEAKER_13]: I walk right up to them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what the medibaba kush is,
but just having a smell of it the other
[SPEAKER_13]: day.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a bit of bubba and a bit of.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a bit of bubba.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is fire.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is fire.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see the fire in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love the darkness on it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: You go from underneath trying the bottom
of this big, look at this nut,
[SPEAKER_15]: big, huge nut.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got to go down.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is like I said, this is ready to come
down.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've experimented.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we don't add any extra nuts.
[SPEAKER_13]: Got anything in the bottom of your pot?
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do the job.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovely place.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got plants in all levels of flower
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks like about three, two,
three weeks in.
[SPEAKER_04]: A beautiful electrical setup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like they've done things proper
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Proper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many lights we got in here?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we got 150.
[SPEAKER_13]: How much?
[SPEAKER_13]: 80.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: 80 and flowering in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: 80 right here.
[SPEAKER_13]: The strain we got here.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the same strain that you just saw
finishing over there.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the pre-98 bubba.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, the pre-98.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone loves the pre-98.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here it's actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, that's the pre-sort.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we got some green cracks here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, little Cecil C in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the bubba man.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you working it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, dude, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a great situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting back on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love getting my hands dirty,
especially this kind of dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things look great.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting there better.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting better and better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a little trial and error here
and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love the tables on the wheels.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a key right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's efficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it just works, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a friend build his tables on pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: No wheels.
[SPEAKER_04]: He puts them all on pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then literally the tables are super
long and he's only got a 12 inch row that
[SPEAKER_04]: goes between any, and you can,
with two fingers, you can move,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the things from here to the end of
this room with like plants on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just literally like go like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unreal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: The new one, this is Deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys picked this up in Cali as well?
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the mezzanine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is always the best shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mezzanine.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy's got a great little thing going
on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: See if we let it finish like we don't.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big unresonant flavor and everything else.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just bringing out some of your plants
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just keeping them off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go see the mamas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get this white balance proper.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what kind of strains we got going on
here?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, let me see.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we got 398.
[SPEAKER_13]: Green crack.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got our best, strongest,
nicest, funkiest strain right here.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a Ken Dog.
[SPEAKER_13]: And some people call it a San Fernando
Valley Kush.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the clones got mixed up in the
beginning, and so some people know it as a
[SPEAKER_13]: San Fernando, but it's a Ken Dog,
and it's super nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Super Kenny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this, you have the green crack in
here, and you have your pre-98.
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe this, he probably has a few
mothers downstairs.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see the dead head OG down here,
but we've got a head man.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got a alien OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this the same as the?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we got the orange one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks nice, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So start taking clones, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm grabbing for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grab this branch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be too light,
John.
[SPEAKER_04]: For you guys, anytime.
[SPEAKER_04]: John loves that cam.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the cam.
[SPEAKER_13]: This one I think is, we call this one OG
beanie.
[SPEAKER_13]: OG beanie.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pink crack, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing looks a little gnarly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny when mothers become,
it's like, because it's, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe it's just from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't like, once you just start taking
care of a mother, I'm sure it's like cut
[SPEAKER_04]: her down, cut her down.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, every time I cut it down,
I'm like, oh, I could, these are clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could give them away to my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a hard time just cutting those tops
and tossing them in the garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, I have a hard time around here
too, and we've cut off a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got, I got my, my, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the above us greens, the way the
foliage stacks up on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: John, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Our only kind of failure was, I think,
not bringing some of ours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't it have been cool to be like,
have some Congo?
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure would.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some sweets going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need an astro boy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know where we're at,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a great reason to go to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_16]: I love this view right here.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a great view.
[SPEAKER_16]: This reminds me of you getting on.
[SPEAKER_16]: The zip line.
[SPEAKER_16]: A zip line.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what this makes me think of.
[SPEAKER_16]: Where's his zip line?
[SPEAKER_04]: That is pretty sweet view.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_13]: My buddy in here, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to get him out, or you want me to
just...
[SPEAKER_13]: This doesn't have a lot of flavor to it,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: I just smelled it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't have a lot of smell to it,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: This is actually the dead head,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's starting to get this lemon,
but it should have more... Mild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it comes later, though.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to go 10 weeks with it at
least, and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got right here, this one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there, that is our headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: More flavor on that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube channel, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's just some silly sort of
ridiculousness.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got going on over here,
boys?
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll remember how I show you the finning,
how I do my peeling.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, just peeling it off.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, just peeling this one leaf,
but I do that, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, not taking the top, just taking that
one.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just taking this one little leaf,
it causes a little stress in the skull of
[SPEAKER_16]: my body.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just the one leaf?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the leaf, it's just... One of the
mains, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing looks like a houseplant.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tupac.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tupac, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I love the old school... Excuse me,
I'm getting ready for the next run.
DNA?
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody changed the strain of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, this one's got a bit of mildew.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's the problem with the strain
that we have here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one smells nice, though.
[SPEAKER_17]: These were going to come down,
right?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, they were saved because
everything changed.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's Candy Crush and Bubble OG mixed in
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's trippy how certain strains are more
susceptible to things.
[SPEAKER_17]: These ones fucking killed us, the mildew,
man.
[SPEAKER_17]: We had to throw out so much shit,
it's not even funny.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you can see.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can run it into hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: The oil will melt away the mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wash it with water, it'll just wash
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your resiny shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: The one down there that's yellowing,
that's the kosher crush we just started
[SPEAKER_17]: trying out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, the kosher.
[SPEAKER_05]: We changed it up here, we put all the fans
on the side of the walls because that was
[SPEAKER_05]: John talking about there's not enough air
in some places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we need to put next door as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this does feel good right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you feel good in your room,
I think your plants are too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's kosher?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll come around the back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the back?
[SPEAKER_03]: With some purple?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the same as that tall stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Bubble OG Candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the Bubble OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all these, this unit, the unit next
door, we turned all the way to the San
[SPEAKER_03]: Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all San Fernandos going here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some finished over next door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's such a finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having trouble dealing with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And which one is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the kosher's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA representing all the way over here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, boys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see it glistening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of work, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're not growing plants,
you're growing trichomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you get this many plants,
whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: San Fernando Valley Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got brought in here and it's saved by
the injunction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice clean electrical.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are rocking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love seeing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can tell by how clean it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Resi corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they make some funny jokes?
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be from cold, it can be from
genetics, it can be from like a variety of
[SPEAKER_04]: things, purpling.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can generally tell when it's a
stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some strains just go purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at these little stockies.
[SPEAKER_17]: These ones here?
[SPEAKER_17]: They're all San Fernando here now,
but these are the ones, these are on week
[SPEAKER_17]: nine.
[SPEAKER_17]: These two, someone forgot to water when I
was away.
[SPEAKER_17]: I had to re-water them after they came
back.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're just hardy, like rocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going extra weeks now too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make sure with dry sift that you use
buds that don't have any mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just saw one that had some.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can wet wash mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can clean it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It washes away.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I took a picture of it, you'd see it
under a micro lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like little ant bodies that are
connected.
[SPEAKER_04]: One little section to another little
section.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they grow in long strings.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these got affected because we had a
push on this side that we took down a week
[SPEAKER_06]: before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that's where kind of the
spread starts spreading it around.
[SPEAKER_06]: San Fernando Valley Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see we're running these newest
stocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the hydroxyl odor processor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that, how does that work?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, these are demo units.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to not adjust this one unit
to see how to do what's supposed to clean
[SPEAKER_13]: the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's inside there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know if it's using water or if
it's using carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a carbon, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the old school guys from the 70s
and the 80s, they were using 55 gallon
[SPEAKER_04]: barrels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole room, before it blew out
exhaust, it would go through a 55 gallon
[SPEAKER_04]: barrel drum of water, like right to the
bottom, like a bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it would bubble out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he had a top on it that blew it
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: No smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water robs the smell just like a bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just sucks the fucking little molecules
right out of the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to walk down to the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannibus.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have a lot of work cut out for
you here, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nonstop, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't have any idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you just grow weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're a hippie.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are nice, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty sweet to be here in Toronto and get
invited to a nice facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are pretty sweet guys,
pretty nice dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, they've got a pretty nice grow
going on here with some nice strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smells great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got another Boss Hydroxyl Odor Processor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we smelt the goodness when we got here
outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, the lights just went out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night, girls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night, girls.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nighty night.
[SPEAKER_06]: My girl's license is over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's yours on the door there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Girls, save that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just took tables out of here to make
more space because of, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: everything's extended now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we think that space opened up now for a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so just some more little
babies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's all the little girls here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting them ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always need room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, even four on the chair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally, it's like we need a chair here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever can help.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting rid of these reflectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to make, I'm going to get
another reflector to the side.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can get higher with the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there'll be a lot more space,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Breathing space for these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and these are going to be,
these are basically ready to go for
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, these are going to be brought down
this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you start them in like a three-gal?
[SPEAKER_04]: We start them in this little.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a two?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the two-gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the two-gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: They go into the 15-gallons here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And here is where they finish off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: 15-gallons.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't go big or go home, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, they say grow big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or grow home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grow home.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got new light in there?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just went boom.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess everywhere else, too, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it goes this way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it going first, second, third,
fourth?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Johnny, we're going to open up
the new T5s.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hanging out somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_16]: Checking out some stellar shit.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got this new T5 that we've always
been talking about.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hangs three ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: Enviro-Gro T5.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's just roll it right over down.
[SPEAKER_16]: Set it down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lift her up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Need more tape on those two edges.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Christmas time for growers.
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each individual one sheathed.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, this is the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, those are fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I'm excited for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn that baby around.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, my buddies are right beside each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: He made a little thing, but this is cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be like over here to your buddies,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, closer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally right beside it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he custom did his own sheaths.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's at OCD.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about you right now,
Ron.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys maybe saw him on the video when I
went to the Kootenays and made hash
[SPEAKER_04]: outside with a guy in the snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Ron.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because we've been talking about
this exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but now it's a product and you can
just buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so who sells this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Enviro-Gro or Hydrofarm?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hydrofarm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Designed and engineered in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Distributed by Hydrofarm.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Designed and engineered in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: in tiny, tiny little letters made in
China.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think these are the new 6,700 or 6,500 K
tubes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lumino put up to 60,000, 6,400 K tubes.
[SPEAKER_04]: 6,400?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are those new tubes they say.
[SPEAKER_06]: There they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to plug that thing in or what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Plug it in over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great to see it plug in.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got to unplug?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The orange one?
[SPEAKER_04]: The white one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold the white one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom, I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that there's three switches for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty, no shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even opened, I thought it was going to
be thirds.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_12]: I should turn the next one on.
[SPEAKER_12]: This one?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the other one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Turn that off.
[SPEAKER_12]: That one.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got it staggered.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can stagger them too, like one and
every other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of guys are doing that.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're staggering them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these things are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the retail on one of these?
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_12]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Retail on one of these if someone's got to
go buy one?
[SPEAKER_04]: 300 bucks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't know how it costs at 300,
but I think the store is probably 6,000.
[SPEAKER_12]: 6,000 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, these are $500 to $600 retail.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a shop, you might be able to
pick them up for a three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's a 12, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like you put that in the back of
the tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_16]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_16]: What if we put in some like EDM music and
like a strobe?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Saw it here first.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_16]: You heating that bitch up or what?
[SPEAKER_13]: We like low temperature dabs around here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know about you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I usually use a cap.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you run a cap very much or
you don't do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just going to hit it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're hitting it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's your pipe.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as the hash hits, then you know
you have the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little mini.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice low temp dabbing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Five little ponies.
[SPEAKER_16]: The 390 above that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Who wants a dab?
[SPEAKER_13]: John wants a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it hot at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy with the sore back first.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like it's just a nice pop of
Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except it gets you super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does have that kind of smell,
especially coming off the nail on the low
[SPEAKER_04]: temp.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I miss, man?
[SPEAKER_17]: I know what I'm missing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm getting the Malawi gold.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just that fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things you just never see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just so ahead, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Spain's creeping up now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spain's on it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys go to the span of his cup?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got so many great friends there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just basically had the time of our life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Filmed, cruised around, made hash with the
Ripper Seeds guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Made hash with Javier from Medical Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Went and chilled out with Jamie at Resin
Club.
[SPEAKER_04]: Went and chilled with Soma and all those
guys that were visiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a gong show.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you up next?
[SPEAKER_16]: Got a great camera?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: When was the last time you saw me get high
board?
[SPEAKER_12]: Never.
[SPEAKER_12]: Never.
[SPEAKER_12]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, he gets the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_16]: He gets the best one.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you had to heat it up.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to hit a friend.
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys do little dabs using a lot of
chemical stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Use a full mouth bubble.
[SPEAKER_15]: We like to get that up and hot.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, this is a little down.
[SPEAKER_15]: They hit it nicely and you get a better
dab.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just so much more tastier.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're getting told, you're like,
wow, that's tasty as hell.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just salt.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just made with white spice and water.
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything you have.
[SPEAKER_16]: What strain is this?
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_16]: My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_16]: My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is?
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a pre-98 Bubba.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a Kemper Union, which I call Bubba
County.
[SPEAKER_16]: I crossed with the Northern Lakes number
five scum page.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we call it My Little Pony because it's
NL5 page.
[SPEAKER_04]: John's Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the strain that I've been working
with.
[SPEAKER_16]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: We start low rather than high.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work ourselves up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't start high and work ourselves
down.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think he's just a full mouth,
perfect resin right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see one sec here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a thing that I can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That he can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a proper hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That other one is not there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pre-98 Bubba.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got a gift given to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Chem Dog and it helps one of our
patients specifically with cluster
[SPEAKER_01]: headaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually one strain specifically
that's been able to help him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's cut his medication down by 80 or 90
percent.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could I ask you, do they smoke,
vaporize or use metaballs?
[SPEAKER_04]: He smokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He smokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just joints or bowls?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's up to about a half ounce a day with
this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But compared to any other strains he's
tried, this is the one specifically that
[SPEAKER_01]: is really helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only is he eliminating harsh
pharmaceutical medication that plays with
[SPEAKER_04]: the chemistry of his brain, but he's also,
if anyone has any idea what cluster
[SPEAKER_04]: headaches are, take the worst headache
you've ever had and multiply it by like a
[SPEAKER_04]: thousand.
[SPEAKER_16]: I used to have severe migraine headaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Migraines, I've never had clusters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phil turns white when he gets his clusters
and he just disappears.
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to take this back to BC and we're
going to go and see Phil.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to take this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're bringing this back to you,
Phil.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a little continuation on
this show and we'll see if maybe how this
[SPEAKER_04]: works for your cluster headaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd love to see if we could get the
sweat band out to these guys to pass that
[SPEAKER_04]: on to some more people out here that are
suffering from cluster headaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a laboratory that can test and do
a comparison.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: True Genetics, Phil's company,
would love that.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're looking at all the different
accuracies.
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is the one reason that we're
looking at future licensed producers and
[SPEAKER_16]: stuff like that because of the research
that can actually go behind and what
[SPEAKER_16]: they're looking at and what actually we're
able to obtain to help patients worldwide.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, what I really like about
that is being able to have those tests
[SPEAKER_16]: done now, bringing that to Phil,
because we know Phil, how you suffer and
[SPEAKER_16]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to bring him that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to go from there.
That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you in Whistler in about a week,
Phil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, what a nice experience that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking awesome, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm feeling better and better
about Toronto every day that I stay here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're talking about medicine and
talking about what they're doing here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's really friendly, nice guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a great vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a nice grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're humble.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're willing to share.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just, yeah, I like these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that they invited us here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very kind and very trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was interesting to invite us here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know you guys feel that you know
us from our videos, but in reality,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you really don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whenever you approach us and you,
you know, introduce yourselves,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're really happy that you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice to meet all of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes if we come across that we don't
have time or we haven't said hi to you
[SPEAKER_04]: properly, we apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: So busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not trying to pull any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We look at everyone as equals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you have a beautiful 150 light
show or whether you have a small little
[SPEAKER_04]: pipe and you want to share a little bowl
of your hash with us, we're, we're
[SPEAKER_04]: willing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks everyone for watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the week.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a little bit more of an
adventure here on bubble man's world,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we're going to end this one for now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to see you next time on bubble
man's world.
[SPEAKER_04]: That our very own John B was born at.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you say John?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were born there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was born there.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1971.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you are with it in the background.
1971.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny's hospital.
[SPEAKER_04]: My hospital.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hanging out with these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave us a ride back.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so kind of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great seeing the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cover my crazy hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go hang out with now Sean
Cushman.
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're coming for you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys coming for a dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't had a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go have a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to head up to our hotel,
do a little bit of eighth floor food
[SPEAKER_04]: action and dab it up with Sean Cushman and
crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how we roll bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to bubble man's world guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You saw as we were getting out of the cab,
we bumped into Mr. Cushman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we figured we would do a, do a quick
little dab with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of my resin that I grew the
Astro boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been dying to try it actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wet washed it with John.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one for you buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the core.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's car cap out just now, but we'll get
that later.
[SPEAKER_07]: So did you have a good event?
[SPEAKER_07]: You were working at the sublimator booth,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely trying to reach as many
people as possible since Enrico can't be
[SPEAKER_07]: there with this year's event.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy story about Enrico.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the viewers probably know by now
Enrico Bouchard was arrested in a large
[SPEAKER_04]: sting in Quebec that involved 80 cops and
hydroponics owners and seed sellers and
[SPEAKER_04]: growers and greenhouses and houses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, really deep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just full bullshit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Full on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, just figure, you know, they
prosecute something for four packs of
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Four packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meantime, Emory sold a million of the
packs of seeds and he never got charged by
[SPEAKER_04]: the Canadian government.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the most he got was a fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: From us.
[SPEAKER_07]: From us.
[SPEAKER_07]: From us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually here in Canada, we know how to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which reminds me, you know, Mark's going
to be back in about a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Emory will be out of Yazoo City.
[SPEAKER_04]: He will no longer be in Mississippi as a
resident of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: But indeed, I think the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: consuming Mark Emory for those five years
truly did exactly what Adam Bowen wrote
[SPEAKER_04]: about in his song Puffin on the Trifone,
which was Uncle Sam has ingested marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: in the form of Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think he's going to start seeing
things a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark went into prison and within six
months, the prosecuting attorney who
[SPEAKER_04]: prosecuted Mark started to work on legal
cannabis in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with Jody's help, like think about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the guy that prosecuted him and
put him in prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the same guy that worked on getting
cannabis allowed in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mark had an effect just by going into
their prison and being consumed by them.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's learned bass.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's playing music.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be great to have him back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't wait for him to come out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to definitely see him and
hang around with him a little bit when he
[SPEAKER_07]: gets out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure you can't wait to see
everybody when he gets out of there too.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, apparently he's going to be here
first right here in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He gets out here first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be coming out here probably for
the... Alright, Johnny's loading it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Corner camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Corner camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just going to continue to puff
some bowls here, but I wanted to share a
[SPEAKER_04]: few minutes showing that Sean Cushman was
in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mentioned the Sublimator booth who he was
working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give your support to those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try and get in touch with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely support Sublimator guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ordered their products and yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Load them up.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hit a little bit of Medi here right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: Load them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace for now guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
