[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bowman's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here today on my 42nd Earthstrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: My son was playing piano in the
background, but he's now stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep playing, bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I would share a bowl with you
guys, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I share so much with you guys
as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made sense that on my birthday I would
come and share a nice bowl, a nice rip for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even mention a little bit of this
exosphere ball rig that High Integrity
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass Art is selling with the OFZ that
never existed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have the mothership calendar,
you've seen this piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on March this month, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing the calendar picture is
missing is the OFZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimized flavor zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was just completed recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made the whole piece just really,
you know, finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have an interest in picking up
such a beautiful piece, PM me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This piece is for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: 33 Opal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy exosphere ball rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a bit of a roller,
so I'm going to go and put that right back
[SPEAKER_00]: on top there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suspect we better have a nice little
rip while we're sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about something bluesy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for a little blues while we're
hitting this Full Melt Sweet Skunk Dry
[SPEAKER_00]: Sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's true, I haven't been rosin-ing
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do hit Full Melt Bubble and Full
Melt Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely rip of the Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting used to this Puking Bee Quartz
Carb Cap as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really like that, little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big fan of this aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always use a different dabber than the
dabber that comes on my carb cap,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I definitely like this part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little part right there is just a
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A choice little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, how bad do you guys want me to just
light this baby up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do too, but I'm not sure that I got
$25,000 to put into it just yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you think you might have $25,000 to
put into it, send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today might be a birthday video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just make the video this little
short introduction and that could be it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but depending on who comes by,
who shares different hashtags,
[SPEAKER_00]: who shares with me, I might have to make
that a video as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Johnny B is going to try and come
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was telling me earlier that he is
crushing some full Congo plants over the
[SPEAKER_00]: screens, probably right now as I say this,
so that will be exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've invited some other people from
the community, so hopefully we'll see some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, do yourself a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I take a rip, you take a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my request.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, so I am just over in my backyard
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been working most of the morning editing
videos for you guys for the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still trying to catch up on the Barcelona
shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbor must hear that I'm outside
about to film.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's decided to turn his bandsaw on,
which is pretty much what he's done every
[SPEAKER_00]: time in the last two years since I've been
out here, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are a pretty cool audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't mind a little bandsawing,
a little circular sawing, a little
[SPEAKER_00]: jigsawing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I was going to take a little
rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the new banger there from DC Glass,
so I'm pretty stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little go-go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birthday rips in the pock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to do a dunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real thick glass on these DC pieces there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're three millimeters
or what it is, the thickness, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very thick and they're definitely a little
bit tricky the first time you heat them up
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't know how hot it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really turn orange the first
several times that you turn it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time for a dunk through the fab egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just a little bit hot, but still
pretty darn nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the next pop spot.
See you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
