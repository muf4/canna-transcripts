[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, Bubbleman here with the cannabis
reverend, Mr. Jeff Church in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're actually on a mission for
isopropanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isopropanol!
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to clean the rigs, can't bring the
rigs home dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mothership right now is quite dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we are walking down one of the
busier streets in Barcelona, one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: more famous streets called the Ramblas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see kind of behind us there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of see a little in front.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely a lot of people walking
down this street on any given day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have discovered there's a pharmacy
up ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: One that's open until 11.30 which is in
about 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one that's apparently 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the guy who we bought our
souvenirs for our kids and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he told us, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we figured we'd take you guys for a
little walk down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Ramblas.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great, you see how it opened up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those waffles smell really good,
I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, you should have been like,
you know that gluten?
[SPEAKER_03]: It smelled really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was some good gluten.
[SPEAKER_03]: The worst coffee in the world,
right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dunkin' coffee?
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was Dunkin' donuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Dunkin' donuts are good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that's the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet the coffee's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably just as bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, coffee everywhere here has been
good, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy throwing this thing up in the air
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one for my kid one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, La Famasía, look, La Famasía.
[SPEAKER_02]: La Famasía.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go find that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a big line up,
we can't go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can't go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine, we stand in line, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so here I am in line at La
Famasía.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Ramblas, trying to get the
isopropanol to clean the mothership.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you clean the mothership good,
it's just glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just clean, clean, clean,
and that's what I have to do every time I
[SPEAKER_03]: travel, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're here doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what happens, I don't know if I see
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Random dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so that worked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That worked out good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't allowed to film.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, you're not allowed to film
apparently here, but check this shit out.
[SPEAKER_03]: 96%.
[SPEAKER_03]: 96%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess now we can go puff tough for
many hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: What time are you hanging out?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hanging out until the 25th,
so I still got a whole nother day.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you be up until two or three o'clock
or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so I'll see you till the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go back to the apartment,
walk down the Ramblas, because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: totally fun, and we'll catch up with you
guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another segment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel so great about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That alcohol is a big deal to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I feel like I can clean it and get it
all done, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The great thing about that is the two
dollars you spent on the ISO and the time
[SPEAKER_02]: to do all this is going to pay you back
over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was two dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I have to mention that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ISO was two dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know about you guys,
but that is like the cheapest isopropanol
[SPEAKER_03]: I have ever purchased in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two euros.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can take this one, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Santande.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we can take the McDonald's KFC one as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to go straight in or are
we going to go out of the way and then
[SPEAKER_03]: back again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is like a weird thing that we
just bring back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just go and see if we find out where
we're going.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go with the flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go with the flow with the go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the sewage just smells so good
down this street.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and with the garbage, that's a good
combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the open sewers are pretty stanky at
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, remember when you're walking in
Spain, the puddles in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_03]: street aren't puddles.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you want to make sure you don't
roll your suitcase through that or do
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that's going to do that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this will be interesting to see if
this road gets us to the church.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure it's going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty wild that they said put
that camera away.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not overly surprised by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like they're doing garbage pickup
tonight, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Garbage pickup.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder where we're going to end up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Streets are so incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Confusing to a degree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little tagging going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's got to be this way,
because that's where the McDonald's and
[SPEAKER_03]: the KFC are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were originally coming in way from over
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the church?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, where's the big church?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's close to here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big, big church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big church down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Catedral.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Catedral is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're super close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk like this way and then to the
right, or you can walk this way and to the
[SPEAKER_00]: street and then to the left.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we just went past, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew we were in the middle, because one
entrance is over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other entrance is over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We came in on a weird middle little
street, but we're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find it eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're making our way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got ISO.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe how happy I am about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gifts for the children.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gifts for the children.
[SPEAKER_03]: Key.
[SPEAKER_03]: My son will love his soccer ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm almost thinking about getting a
soccer ball, too, for my son.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he'll love it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves sports.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Active little dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really a sports fan or,
like, really too big into sports much,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he just thrives on it for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for him, because he's not you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I love about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You better walk fast if you want to keep
up with us, son.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're at this big cop building.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, where the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is it.
This is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the police building right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the police building.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put all the flags and shit up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Serious shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should go do dabs on the front steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs on the front steps of the police
station?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a nice big cadet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble man says dabs on the police station
front porch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs in the cadet.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I say, old boy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us go to the church.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the church on time, I say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I stayed really close to here last time I
was here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too far from here at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these side streets with a really
beautiful gothic apartment for three
[SPEAKER_03]: bedrooms for 120 euros a night.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were four of us staying there,
so it was 30 bucks a piece per night for a
[SPEAKER_03]: wicked apartment with a huge living room
and kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's so cool walking around
these old buildings.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the history, it's like this fucking
horse used to push through here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stones you're walking over have been
walked over.
[SPEAKER_02]: For hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hundreds and hundreds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wall in the museum was 500 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's older things here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Motherfuckers knew how to build.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that munch.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: This almost looks like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just keep trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everything looks like a beautiful
old church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst case scenario, we go back to the
Ramblas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't that far off the Ramblas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, look.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like Sagrada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, where are we?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so Jeff and I are lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: We took a wrong turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about this set of doors right here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's a fucking door right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: These dudes look serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like breaking out his hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, show me thou rosin technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show me your rosin technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a meme right now happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get that money, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: $200 on the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had like five or six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy, yo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that was a trippy sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty funny with all my monies
flying across the.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I think we should go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've pretty much forgotten the way we came
already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can look on the map and see where we're
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's more fun almost to not look at
the map.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having fun, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I know the Bubble Man's audience
right now is enjoying us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Walking around Barcelona in the Gothic
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Gothic area is cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yes, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's check.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so for some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to be, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this was like shot up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this was not it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, bullets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is war zone, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a war zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was some serious weapons
shooting at these walls.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I wish we had the torch in the nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be hitting that shit right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some serious shit went down right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're just showing everyone around,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: People apparently like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of coming for more than just the dab
session and the knowledge, but get a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of a trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of the experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, OK, maybe I've never been to
Barcelona, but this is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm walking through the Gothic
area right now with Reverend and Bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can get nice and rippered and
walk around here and just get lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a whole lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you always eventually find yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing about walking around here
all lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best if you have a buddy, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great to have a buddy with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember going down a hill like this,
but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, but this is a.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something different, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were getting close to Sagrada Familia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have five hours to get lost and then get
found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but we don't have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then get back.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dab rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many grams to smoke before you leave,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I remember the smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the smell, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost remember walking down this lane.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just need to ask Donde este la Ramblas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Donde este la Ramblas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramblas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ramblas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todo recto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calle Ferran y a la derecha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, gracias.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, that worked rather well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simply asking, hey, where is the Ramblas?
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get back to the Ramblas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we can go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go back to the McDonald's,
though, and it's really close to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just came in a way that didn't go to
where we were going.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it walked right through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, boys.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ramblas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to the right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, we want to go to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is where we want to go,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Placa de San Josef Oriol 9.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know where this is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Placa de San Josef Oriol?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oui.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oui, no?
[SPEAKER_03]: La Ramblas?
[SPEAKER_03]: La Ramblas está por allá.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, gracias.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're on our way good,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the spray painting crew we went by
earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing it, killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the security guard making sure they
spray paint good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I pull it out, it pulls money
out of my pocket, as you noticed earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramblas is right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we took him for a little walk,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: How fun is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see where you need to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, beer, beer, smoke, smoke,
the charge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Careful of the piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: See?
[SPEAKER_03]: Church.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice and close, nice and close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many pisses, many pisses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people are pissing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are pissing many's.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, church.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is our square.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our friends are in that apartment right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just got to our friend's doors here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bang, bang, bang.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already pushed the button right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hope these guys clown us up here
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hope these guys buzz us up here
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming and getting us,
Rick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a sweet little pad, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: My D-Nail's already set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I've been here before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Frankfurt and then home.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we got going on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Respect to the dabbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Respect to the dabbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: A turpologist?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a turpologist?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already heard of a rosin technician.
[SPEAKER_03]: A rosin technician?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just took a great picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my phone died.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was basically around the church
where the three guys are statues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's another guy down on his knees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like I want to make a meme that's
like, sorry that your CLS cost $25,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my rosin tech is on point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one dude's just on his knees like
in shame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ready to meme out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we rosining now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what we're doing too?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on over here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I want to hit that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just wanted to, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff some of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My rig's in the other room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I be bringing it to this room?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want me to get it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you trust me to move it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you trust me to move it?
[SPEAKER_03]: If we have a place to plug in and we're
good, yeah, why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got the hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a gift to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anyone else wishing me a maximum?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like fucking with my mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that turp?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I should have cleaned some too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it still needs to be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little mount right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks ready to clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it cleans to?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to puff some.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long did it take you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Five minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little static tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one way to bring it, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll leave you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got faith in your skills in
carrying around expensive glass,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got faith.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a plug right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, do you want to take the plug?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't even have to move like I'm in my
spot already.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put it where you want to put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that for transfer?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to want to get this nut out of
here though, yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Jiggy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so here we are with Rick and
Ramon.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up Old Man's World?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one in the morning and I think I
leave at three hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what did we think we would do?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did we do before I leave?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dab out and just keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the flight was relaxed and
cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some dry hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a little bit of carding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a little bit of the
static trick and tell us about this paper
[SPEAKER_03]: you got here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up using it on the last run of the
Nicole when I cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because we didn't have any parchment
paper but it seems to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you using this side?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this side.
[SPEAKER_03]: As your outside?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to wrap that book right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice big 75 micron mesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually pretty small.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do with the 75 micron?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I use it once it's cleaned up in
the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Push it through and just clean it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I would suggest is get a 250 micron
of one of these and then when you clean
[SPEAKER_03]: this hash, run it through the sieve before
you put it on this screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it falls, it's milled like flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm telling you, it will be much
more effective when you do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's little balls in here and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's breaking down, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it has to go through like a sieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we had to... I'm just trying to
think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave that box away.
[SPEAKER_03]: 130s will work a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might lose some heads but let's just
test it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the bottom one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hold that if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice amount of contaminant you've already
pressed through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you ever use a brush?
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, but it's just like palm oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is true, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makeshift.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the makeshift situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely know how to use yours,
but...
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, we can put this one right on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if we can get... See,
I can run a little bit of that through
[SPEAKER_03]: here, a nice little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should fall real nice and even in a
little circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that's a good better amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just gently card that through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually a makeup brush would do the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean if it was a 250, you could do
it with a makeup brush or a shaving brush.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be more than enough actually
just for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then it falls nice and even and
there's no little bumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those little bumps are problematic in the
carding and in the static trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cutting away the excess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cutting it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we do right before we leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real 1.30 in the morning crowd over
there right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all kind of quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Except me and Jigga because we just ate
smacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just ate smacks, yo.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.30 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: smack attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you have an area where you can
put your nice clean headies?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was using this for the other pile with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see it real close for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have two distinctly different colors
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one on the right is a more
contaminated version but right on the edge
[SPEAKER_03]: it looks like it's a white hash all the
way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are pure heads for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really see it down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just white.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow it all the way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you obviously know to try and split
those two piles up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a harder part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you another thing with this that
will help.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you card with it instead of going
like this like with the side of the card
[SPEAKER_03]: just use the flat part of that and just
literally go like a very small distance
[SPEAKER_03]: and then lift it up and you should have
even more than that on and it should be
[SPEAKER_03]: like right across this whole flat area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Headies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some headies over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and see a card works perfect for this
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to have a brush if you do but if
you don't it sure is easy enough to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with a card.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some fresh headies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just looks like regular old sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah just once even.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you'd be surprised how fast it
will happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of get it at an angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's gathering right there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah this side right there and then you
might have some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this one's all contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's mostly right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll kind of learn the way to hold it
and how much to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah wipe that off first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a little go.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little show.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some turps?
[SPEAKER_03]: Turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Snurp a turp if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Cheat Concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn it up.
Cheat Concentrate.
