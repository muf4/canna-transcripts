[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Balloon Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back again.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is part three of the Whistler
excursion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was quite an excursion.
[SPEAKER_03]: My Little Whistler, we're going to call
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We took the My Little Pony, fresh,
frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh, frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it quite a bit when John was dumping
it all over the hotel entrance and at the
[SPEAKER_03]: elevator when he was dumping the cooler
over accidentally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just bringing some nice flavors to
the hotel room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some nice flavors to the hotel room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyway, what we are at now with where
we're at now is we've got a nice big piece
[SPEAKER_03]: of cardboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually attached to my screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So mostly the only thing that is on this
cardboard is a little bit of dry sift,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I've managed to get most of it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the two microphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: John has the frozen material.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just pulled it out of a Pelican case,
which we have stuffed with frozen juices
[SPEAKER_03]: and ice packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's our little mini cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way we don't have to continue to
bring the material in and out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I've got my pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already done the 190 micron here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is the 160.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do the 160 now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really just... And then once we're
done with the 160, we'll write on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this 160, of course, is going to be
a little bit dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I would suggest getting some type of a
rubber glove.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually sieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I sieve, I use a spoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't touch the bubble whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to clean my fingers,
make sure there's no skin particles,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll be very careful when I grind
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, because John made a little
bit of a mistake when we first made this
[SPEAKER_03]: batch, he went to clean the 220 bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to pull his microphone out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inside of the 160 bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it is a little bit... There's a little
bit of leaf in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it will be very easily to distinguish
once it's broken into a powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice and sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still maintaining its coolness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the freezing of the microplane
helped as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeping them nice and cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a few little chunks,
which will be identified by the rolling
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chunks make great for actually throwing
into your cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the cleaning of the microplane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always seems like it's going to be
impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you just give it one good whack,
and it's clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so that is the 160.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next is this here, and this is the 120.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, this is a lot of it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really frozen, isn't it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frozen, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom of the screen for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably going to break that right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thirds at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a really good tip for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to be using too large of a
piece when you're microplaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts melting in your fingers,
particularly of this quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to melt very fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to move over to the next planer
here that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that white?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is white for 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not white for 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's white for snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just so white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be really careful when we get down to
these last pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of gently rubbing it over the
microplaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always nice having someone to help
you while you're doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge...
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to do it all on your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always nice to have a good buddy
especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who grows killer resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always nice to have a good buddy that
makes killer bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's a symbiotic relationship we
share.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks like we just threw some white
icing sugar on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe the color.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to see the 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is the 120?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might break that one in too.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this Pelican case here full of ice and
some frozen packs is keeping this just
[SPEAKER_05]: perfect and in the pizza box from that
marvelous pizza we had in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to keep my fingers nice and
clean so as to not let it build up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be a very tricky thing getting ooey
gooey resin on your fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get yourself in a position where
you make a very big mess in a very short
[SPEAKER_03]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to keep those fingers clean as
you're going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, if you wear the gloves you
can freeze the gloves and the resin just
[SPEAKER_03]: pops right off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to keep any type of
particulate from your fingers out of here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to have gloves on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I do not have them.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the world of bubbles we do what we must
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We trot on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give this a little whack to release what's
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many more 120 pieces do we have?
[SPEAKER_03]: One more after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more after this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we'll go in a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh sorry, too small.
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean that's just coming apart so perfect
and it would be really nice to take some
[SPEAKER_05]: nice shots of that and show that the heads
aren't all mangled or chopped up that we
[SPEAKER_05]: were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll definitely take a shot of this
with the macro lens of each variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the smell is just hitting me so
much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's really nice, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's your next piece of 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next piece of 120 coming through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find that when you do it flat,
you'll get a nicer plane, a more surface
[SPEAKER_03]: area of bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's touching the plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gives her a nice, almost not too thick,
but just a nice even spread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, comes out nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still prefer a strainer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_03]: A strainer is nice for me because I don't
touch the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just imagine how high you're going
to be getting as you're doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much, it all gets absorbed
through your skin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when touching really color resin,
understand that that is also going into
[SPEAKER_05]: your blood system.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why he's happy right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see the smiles get bigger and
bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-active though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-active.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm still going to smile, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we've got our 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: That 120 is basically the majority.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're going to get another piece of
cardboard because we're getting some
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger pieces out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get the 73 because there's
just not enough room for the 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to place the 73 here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll run it through my little guy,
my nice macro plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out a beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep everything cold as you're planing,
if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep the bubble cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep the planer cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your fingers cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you can keep cold is going to be
helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can do it in a cold environment,
that's not going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just had his hands in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I washed them from the last.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to part really nicely right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just crumbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too bad it's staying on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that much this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much, not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give it a little...
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's because there's moisture
present.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's making it easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: That moisture definitely makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we've got our 73.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to mark that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you think you can remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just write it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: 73, 120, 160, and 190.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to replace this cardboard with
a clean one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put this one up in our stack so it's out
of the way and protected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we'll be back in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we've got our nice fresh piece of
cardboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of rips in it that I
don't really like because it's actually
[SPEAKER_03]: exposing fibers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we did all the 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we did the 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we got to keep that straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's playing games with me, tricking me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, just keep me on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep me on my toes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep me on your toes.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so this is one of the
favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just crumbling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's making for easy crumbling,
so whoever says it has to be completely
[SPEAKER_03]: frozen, I, after doing that, must disagree
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have quite a bit more 90 here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is real nice the way it's
crumbling up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the more...
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you experiment, the more you
realize everything can change with your
[SPEAKER_03]: environment and the humidity and the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way less sticking to my fingers this time
because it isn't frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to push as hard on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got another piece after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just watching it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just coming apart perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice and gentle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our last nice thick piece of 90.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Save the best for last.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't too shabby, hey?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, very happy with that for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smell is just awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so the 90 is planed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do my little roll the hash off your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll end up usually seeing these pieces
in the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll have a little bit of a different
texture to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they really are just gonna have a tiny
bit of moisture trapped in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they usually just puff those early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, here's a 45.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going into 45 now,
are we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right into 45.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a little 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: 45.
45.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we have left after that,
just 20?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting right down to the last.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see by the looks of everything here,
it's upwards of over 10 palomarums at
[SPEAKER_04]: least, I'll say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we'll get our 10% return at
least.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're definitely getting that 10% return.
[SPEAKER_03]: 45 has that very strong turpination,
turpene smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just, I can always know when it's the
45.
Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Truly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also the first bubble that is usually
the one to light a flame when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I've been smoking much lately
since I got the D now.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more piece of 45.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, that's 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaving them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: One little trichome head at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, one little trichome head at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes 50,000 heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 50,000 right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I raise you 50,000 heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an extra 5,000 there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the moisture content's good in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got enough moisture that it's not
really sticking to my fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The moisture allows for it to,
that little bit of water makes for good
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's easy to go through and pick up
the tiny little chunks that are too big
[SPEAKER_03]: and just run them gently through the micro
planer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a two size planer here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the one size, the smaller size is
pretty easy to touch directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got smaller blades, I guess you would
say, and because of that, it's gentle on
[SPEAKER_03]: my fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not peeling my fingers off on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least is just one big
chunk of 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, truly the one that you can
honestly get away with, sometimes drawing
[SPEAKER_03]: a patty, we're just going to micro plane
it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crumbles right up perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never have a problem drawing the 25
micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it has a lot to do with the fact
that the heads are so much smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: Less water actually fits between the heads
on the outside of the heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think of it like a bowl of grapes,
the larger the grapes, the more surface
[SPEAKER_03]: area between those grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smaller they are, the less space
between them, more can fit in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's less room for moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why the 25 micron has never
really been a problem drawing it,
[SPEAKER_03]: even in a patty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's definitely the one that can
confuse people when you tell them you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't dry bubble in a patty.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might have done it with the 25 micron
and think, yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a quick little micro planing
job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, having somewhere safe to
put this away from dust and debris,
[SPEAKER_03]: pet hair, kids, whatever, is very
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got it in the gorilla tent here on
top of the four by two foot screens.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got them stacked.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be safe and beautiful and
put away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not even dust is going to fall on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really want to make sure you can kind
of create something like that before you
[SPEAKER_03]: get yourself into this situation of having
the bubble all powdered out on the
[SPEAKER_03]: cardboard or parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I guess we're going to put this
over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: John and I are going to hit some bowls.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
Whoa.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah.
Yeah.
