[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us today on this
beautiful sunny afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I'm quite excited because I'm going
to be taking a couple of cuts from two of
[SPEAKER_02]: my favorite sativas, the sweet skunk and
the congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was thinking about how I was going to
go about doing this and I was figuring I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to cut a fairly large, I basically
had to top the sweet skunk anyway today,
[SPEAKER_02]: about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to cut it almost a third of it off
and I figured rather than just cut that
[SPEAKER_02]: off and not actually use it, I could grow
myself a nice plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rather than cut it into four or five
available clones, I'm just going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: it and do one large clone, kind of as an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done this for a long time since
back in the day, I'd say 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I experimented with a process called air
layering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure if any of you are familiar,
but it involves cutting some grooves into
[SPEAKER_02]: the stalk, wrapping a medium that you then
keep moist after applying rooting hormone
[SPEAKER_02]: of some sort, powder or gel, injecting
that material, whether it be rockwool or
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of soilless mixture,
to keep it moist over the course of a 10
[SPEAKER_02]: to 12 day period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And roots appear, even without a clone
having been taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ensures rooting, so then you can then
cut below that and plant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's slower than cloning, but for this
particular purpose, I want to cut a mother
[SPEAKER_02]: plant down and I want to have myself a
bigger plant right away, rather than many
[SPEAKER_02]: small plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do that today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Remo's roots, cloning gel that
I've been using so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hasn't done me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got myself a couple of pucks here
that I've saturated with some water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've squeezed them out so they aren't
completely full.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we'll get ready to cut the sweet
skunk here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think with the sweet skunk,
I'm going to take one large one,
[SPEAKER_02]: but at the same time, I also want to take
a few small ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to cut it right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do the scissor trick,
so when I do cut it, that seals the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sealed perfectly around the stem
of that stalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you see that's actually quite a
large cut to be taking as a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I was thinking of doing was
peeling off this bottom one, John Urfelo
[SPEAKER_02]: style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get that gelled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives us one perfect little sweet
skunk clone and one big giant sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I pulled the stem off, that little
clone, as I pulled it off, it stripped the
[SPEAKER_02]: stalk of a piece of material, fiber,
opening it, which is why I rubbed the
[SPEAKER_02]: cloning gel there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to help me with my
cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine taking a clone this big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to cut that down a few
more times, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you imagine though?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our big monster mama clone here
that is just a little bit too big,
[SPEAKER_02]: even for a big clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to cut it down two
sections.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do that simply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take this guy off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of a dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to peel this guy off as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give this a little snip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little snip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice big clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: These leaves are giants, so we're going to
cut them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too big of a leaf or too small of a
clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got that guy and we got this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I managed to spill a little water there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw those off the deck.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got two little guys left on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just going to do John's little
trick for these guys, which is just peel
[SPEAKER_02]: them right off.
All
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more clone for the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loving this, taking the sweet scone
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I'm definitely stoked on.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So four sweet scone clones have just been
taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go get these guys sprayed and
under the dome and we'll come back and we
[SPEAKER_02]: will do the same thing to the Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take the Congolese cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite excited about this, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just waiting for as long as I did to
acquire this strain and it's I've had it
[SPEAKER_02]: just a couple of weeks and now I'm already
able to take a clone or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got a couple of pucks prepared
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my Remos roots rooting gel in the
house and I've got my Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're going to go right from
the top here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My little scissor trick with a little bit
of a bit of gel on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to come in here at an angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a nice little dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find its new home.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: One Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that felt great to take a couple of
Congolese clones and I'll keep you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: updated on to how long it takes them to
root and hopefully we'll be able to give
[SPEAKER_02]: at least one of them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep watching Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's world,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm back here with another update on my
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have here the Barbara Bud and the
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the great gardener, I have not taken
a cut for myself off of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have taken just a single one off each
one for John, which we updated you about a
[SPEAKER_02]: week ago and his are just rooting now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I figured I would actually sort of cut
into these and start gaining, getting some
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got five pucks a piece for each
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a total of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess what we'll start with is
adding the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some nice, real warm water here,
which of course, John B taught me the
[SPEAKER_02]: trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to sort of, you know,
these can take a much longer time if you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't use as warm water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will just ensure that they sooner
than later absorb that water and fill up,
[SPEAKER_02]: get up to size.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one just down there exploded.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while those are filling up with water,
hydrating, I've got a little plate here of
[SPEAKER_02]: some Arian's haze dry sift that I cleaned
for the great gardener recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple of grades here and I
figure we would just take a rip or two
[SPEAKER_02]: while we were at it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This table down there of safety,
de-nail in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely love the haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is no coincidence that I named,
that we named our son, his middle name is
[SPEAKER_02]: haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: These jumped up real nice in size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much got right to size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's for later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll just get these sorta minorly
squeezed out from all the water that
[SPEAKER_02]: they've absorbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get them out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super beautiful day here in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you could probably notice from the view
behind me, it's 80, 85 degrees Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, which is quite nice for this
time of year for British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get these out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be able to rearrange things a little
bit, a little bit tricky when you have all
[SPEAKER_02]: these different things, especially
priceless dry sift on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put that back over there and we'll
get this warm water put under there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my Remos roots, which is what I'm
going to be using today to do my cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little pair of scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much all we need really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the de-nail over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll start with, let's start with
Barbara.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know of course, a part of me just wants
to cut these tops and bring this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: down in size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever I cut a plant like that,
I have a hard time just throwing it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to take these monster clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I'm not a plant equipped,
so we're going to take nice, small,
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable size clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Remos roots, just the little
piece on the lid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the lid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost never use, well, the odd time
I'll dip in there, but the lid has more
[SPEAKER_02]: than enough gel on it that you can get
that job done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's look around in here for a
beautiful little clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: One.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put Barbara over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll keep Barbara separate from the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think these are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel a little bit warm, but not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up, Barbara bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some perfect little clones in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter of finding them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I scoop it on there quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really overdo it, but I definitely
put on a decent amount of cloning gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, Barbara.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: These leaves at this point are okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of room in my dome,
but often I would cut these down a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit if I had them squeezed in a lot
tighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only little cuts available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, sometimes below towards the
bottom, the little ones seem very strong
[SPEAKER_02]: in the stock, so I don't personally have a
preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I haven't grown in 20 years,
so I don't pretend to know what works
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just doing some honest cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a hundred percent rate so far
since I started, and I pretty much had
[SPEAKER_02]: that back in the day when I was doing
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just find if you pay attention and keep
them hydrated and make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not too high or too low of a pH and don't
overfeed them when they're young babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little insect there landed on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of freaked me out for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's friendly though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we've got three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take two more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more barbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a nice one right in the center
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, even clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't have any bend in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be able to put this one in right
straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four barbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I held up two fingers just making
sure you're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barb.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take one off the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are five pretty good looking clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll go into the dome in a few minutes
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're fine to wait while I take
five off the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both of these are just, I can't imagine
not having them in my stable now that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a strange thing to rely on a friend
for a particular flavor or resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very nice when your friend can just
say, you know what, here's the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do well with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's my attempt with what I'm doing
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if we can find some nice,
nice cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these will be marked in the domes ASAP
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be mixing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: These five will stay in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: One seems so loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a bummer when it seems,
you know what, I think that's a leaf that
[SPEAKER_02]: I could cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: This cuts down on that weight and pulling
the plant around and moving it around and
[SPEAKER_02]: it lets it sort of stabilize.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant is focused on producing roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not worried about those particular
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And often you'll notice on your clones
when you take them, those particular
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves end up dying and falling off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: An Afghani has been taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit bigger on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cut these leaves as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This little Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel very blessed to be able to sit here
of all the places and just be able to take
[SPEAKER_02]: my clones, bring them back into my dome,
put the mothers back in the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a blessing that I really do hope for
all of you out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know some of you have it even
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look sometimes at some of you guys in
California and whatnot and all the amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: things you guys are doing out there with
the ability of these 200 gallon pots that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can plant and the big multi-pound
plants that you grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Subcool's got some beautiful ones each
year and some other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's number three on the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to trim that leaf down as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much more secure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have two left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a treat because you're literally
picking another line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're picking this plant to create
another plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very cool concept, the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty good in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many lovely little clones on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: These particular ones were quite healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And grown up when Matt gave them to me,
they've gotten even more happy since
[SPEAKER_02]: they've spent the time here on the deck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now to think just bam, boom,
bam, like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have a bunch more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get you out of the way
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one nice and tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut it at a 45 angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always cut at a 45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how overly important this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could even cut that down a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: There she goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There she is.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there we have five Afghani clones and
five Barbara bud clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely don't mix these up for the time
being.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take this Barb tag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to throw it in to the Barbara
tub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't underestimate your own ability to
get too stoned and mix up your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the things I believe we should
really sort of step up in this game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a little more professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Name what you have properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what you have properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't mix them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're given something, really
respect that name on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to get the Afghani name
right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are going to go into a Barbara dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we'll catch up with you guys in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe one more rip on the Aryan's haze
because it really is quite nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that old school flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yum.
Put that up forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure is a beautiful day out here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, uh, I'm going to sit for a bit and
enjoy this view and we'll catch up with
[SPEAKER_02]: you inside when I've got the plants in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're back here in my room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've got the Barb clones right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I managed to write down Barb and Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the base of the dome right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to put five and five on
one side, five on the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Barb first goes in there to this
one little Barb kind of leaned over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize, but I had set it down
for about five minutes without a dome in
[SPEAKER_02]: my, in front of my window.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, the drape blew out of the way and
the sun came down just on that one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have faith that we'll bring it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sprayed them before it came back
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's five Barb's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give those a nice more spray just to
have the whole, just moisture inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: dome everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to have that moisture trapped in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sure like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that Barb back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these Afghanis just look awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two, three, four and five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's almost the same amount of these
all look so healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a fifth one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also spray the inside of the dome and
these particularly the domes close and
[SPEAKER_02]: open on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suggest having them closed in the
beginning when the plant really needs that
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture level, especially if you're using
these new lights that I'm using that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: about to show you the ones that John
mentioned just the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they just have little lids that
slide open on both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to slide this right in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the light I'm using.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one that John brought over.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nanotech T5 reflector.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty nice T5 with a, with its own
singular reflector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got it plugged in right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it fits, fits right into the dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over here I have John's MediHaze,
his Haas, which is the Haze OG crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: with the skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have his OG crossed with his Romulan and
an MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over here I have four sweet
skunks and two Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in here the five Barb's and the
five Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did just transplant today two more Astro
Boys, which I'm going to label actually
[SPEAKER_02]: right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything else is right now just sort
of right outside on the deck just enjoying
[SPEAKER_02]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to get back to caring for the
plants and we'll give you an update on the
[SPEAKER_02]: budding plants next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching and I'll see you next
time.
