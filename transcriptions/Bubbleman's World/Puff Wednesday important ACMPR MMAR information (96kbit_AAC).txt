[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, welcome to Bubble Man's
World and welcome to Puff Wednesday,
[SPEAKER_00]: a special Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: edition?
[SPEAKER_00]: A special Johnny B.
edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's... You got to puff
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to puff first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we got to talk about, you know,
what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what led us to talk about what we're
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it came down to, weren't you
looking for your license?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was more along the lines of
you getting harassed both at a traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: stop and then a couple of weeks later at
the Edmonton Airport where they detained
[SPEAKER_00]: you, took your cannabis, charged you with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, that's really what all of
this led to from, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this led from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is... So Johnny's done his
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's figured out exactly what everyone
wants to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us that are sitting... What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Allard trial?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Allard trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the injunction for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have my license over on my wall
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it says expired March 31st,
which does happen to be my birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The expiration date of the... But then the
creation of the injunction and our license
[SPEAKER_00]: has been valid since.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you don't have your license at
a traffic stop, there's some information
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get Johnny B.
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some information you need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really, it's injunction
related to the Medical Marijuana Access
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulations, MMAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got this little letter from Health
Canada to tell you how you can get this
[SPEAKER_01]: little information here and for law
enforcements and for municipalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a derp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please note... After a derp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta do a derp first.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will be like, why did you cut
Johnny B.
off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I cut him off to give him a
damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of darkness on the... There
you go, Johnny.
There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, very good information today we're
gonna be sharing in regards to Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens who wanna learn how to further
protect themselves if they are protected
[SPEAKER_00]: by the Allard Injunction, if they're not
yet a part of the ACNPR, and if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: no idea what you're supposed to be doing
in regards to either of them, if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: already attached to those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Mark said, what it come down to
was me being pulled over first on February
[SPEAKER_01]: 26th last month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was asked if... Basically,
my car smelled like marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a brand new Impreza, so I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got pulled over because, in my opinion,
he ran a plate number.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm getting to know is things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right away, the officer asked me,
do I have my paperwork?
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, I had nothing on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he asked me if I had any marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had them in a container,
like I always do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's my medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should explain to them, too,
how difficult it is to carry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a card in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show them the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's not a card in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the piece of paper in question,
and what we're looking at, has to have
[SPEAKER_00]: this expiry date on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to show them dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show them the back of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show them the length of this piece of
paper, this document that you're supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to carry around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to carry this letterhead piece of
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: In something the size of a wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not supposed to lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you fold it up too much,
and it becomes destroyed, and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: read particular addresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now imagine you folded that to fit it in a
wallet, and it's how many years old now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, four?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is four years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I got it in 2013, 14, 15,
16.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a photocopy of the original
copy that I actually have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did photocopy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to, as an MMR patient in
Canada, Medical Marijuana Access
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulations, and you had a license before
March 31st of 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to carry around a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a card.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it as difficult as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure someone at one point said,
let's make it so they have to carry the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole document, not just an easy card that
fits in your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is part of the problem with many
people in the MMR, and the ACNPR,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the MMPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the ability to carry
around this large document.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes unrealistic, and I'm telling
you, to try and keep the one on my wall as
[SPEAKER_00]: in good condition as I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I handed the officers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I handed them my card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I still do have a card,
but it did expire in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be 10 years old or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is seven years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the cards you used to be able
to get from Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a card on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a beautiful picture on there for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm covering up my address.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before they made the card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they made it more difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually had about a half a dozen of
these particular cards, and I still carry
[SPEAKER_01]: it on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I get questioned, like,
the officer that pulled me over to
[SPEAKER_01]: Abbotsford, I hand it in my card,
and I instructed him to call Health
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, 24-hour hotline, to find out more
information in regards to my license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did he do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The officer in Abbotsford did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this something, you know,
walk us through not only what happened to
[SPEAKER_00]: you, but walk us through what these people
need to know and do for future references
[SPEAKER_00]: before they get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's my notes calling from Health
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really, I put them down on some
other paper here so we can actually go
[SPEAKER_01]: through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What proper links we have to go through
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just put a little thing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can sit back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing is, is really in
reality, when I got arrested and charged
[SPEAKER_01]: in Edmonton, at the Edmonton airport,
we both failed to do two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: A, for one, I failed to present an expired
copy of my license.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, of course, we saw how long it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they failed to do the one thing
that I told them to do right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says in here, additional
information for law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Health Canada provides a 24-hour,
seven-day-a-week service line for law
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement agents to answer any questions
providing through the MMR or AMCPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that number?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it actually written down here,
so I'll give you all those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting that it's not written on the
document that they tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they print off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the one?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the document that you have to get
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to go through the steps that
you had to do to get to this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: little piece of very document.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an important document that you
need to actually refer to, because it
[SPEAKER_01]: talks about the regulations, it talks
about the laws in Canada, and drugs and
[SPEAKER_01]: health products that under the AMCPR and
under the MMA are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to put the link up for you
guys, but John's going to tell the story
[SPEAKER_00]: on how much research he had to do to
actually dig it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so this is something that I told the
officer to do in Edmonton.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you call Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that 24-hour hotline is like,
when I called Health Canada, I was on hold
[SPEAKER_01]: for two hours and 41 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they hung up, because it was the end
of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next day, I was on hold for two
hours and eight minutes, and I finally got
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where these notes come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to a really nice lady,
Cheryl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to her back in 2007 and 2008 when
I first got my license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each province had an individual person
dealing in representation of that
[SPEAKER_01]: province.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I talked to her, she said,
first thing she said to me, I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: in regards to the MMR, they said,
they have no grounds to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing she said, we have no
grounds to talk about it, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who has no grounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the program to them is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not sharing or providing any
information at all on the MMR.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see I've written this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've actually said this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because I had such a good relationship
with Cheryl, she told me some steps that I
could take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you, because I told her
what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need educated people.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, yeah, we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she kind of went into some detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I kind of wrote this out here
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Information you should know about your MMR
license and in regards to maybe being
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to hold a copy of her expired
license dated March 31, 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mark's going to talk a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inform the party there is a 24-hour access
line to confirm your paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they already know this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't give you the number,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's not on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not give you the number that the
law enforcement can call.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the reason why it wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just clicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell the party there's a website to look
up the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to www.healthcanada.gc.ca slash MMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put it across the screen for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to put it across the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I'll do it in editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so here's where it gets tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so and if you type it, you'd see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, first here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we read these first few things?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, step one, step two, step three.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go through these other steps
to tell the officer who is now questioning
[SPEAKER_01]: you about your legal right to carry
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just say, for instance, your piece of
paper is in transit coming back to you
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You watched this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got free information on how to obtain
your license.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you don't have anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to tell him that he needs
to do these specific things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can say you can go to the website
and they all got smartphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take you these steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to click on license producer
because you're going to have two different
[SPEAKER_01]: sections on this page.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to click on license producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will take you to a purple page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talked to Jason Wilcox about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, purple page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to purple page.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, I never knew about a purple page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I never knew about a purple
page either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jason's really involved with the MMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to scroll down to the bottom of
the page and click on the link.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of additional information
for license producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hidden.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll take you to this other website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll put it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to put it up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hcscgc.ca.marijuana for
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next page is also purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now look to the green menu on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be this little green menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Information for medical practitioners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And law enforcement will say in this
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have to click on law enforcement
to tell them to read the section,
[SPEAKER_01]: injunction related to the medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we'll actually do is we'll just
give you the final link so you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to follow five links.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just give up the first, the final
link that will take you right to this law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then save it on your phone or save it
in your browser.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say this does happen and you can't
remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, well, you can go into bubble man's
world and you click on how to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and we'll have this link there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually the officer can find out some
more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Law enforcement, municipalities,
everybody needs to know this information
[SPEAKER_01]: to stop harassing patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on, but you're going to get
this page when you click to this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to this page.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the page.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the page, but it's purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that's not purple anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, I printed this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told that you can print that page
and have it with your license if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you notice the one I printed with my
license there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when we were starting to be allowed
to make derivatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I printed that page and I swear it's off
the website like a day later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they didn't have it on their website
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this purple page is going to have
access under the AMCPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them to scroll down to the last page
and that's going to have what I have here
[SPEAKER_01]: highlighted in yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be that specific
information and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: injunction related to medical marijuana
access regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it purely states, please note that
certain inventors who were previously
[SPEAKER_01]: authorized to possess and produce
marijuana under the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: access regulations, MMAR remain authorized
to do so by virtue of a federal court
[SPEAKER_01]: injunction order.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they want to know more,
they can click on law enforcement and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to be able to know that they
can call in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully at this point, you're not
arresting somebody or you're not being
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: For carrying your medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's great information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's, that's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now like yourself or some other people,
they might've misplaced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know exactly where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we get it back?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get it back?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is more information that Cheryl
kind of went on about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, thanks Cheryl.
[SPEAKER_01]: She really knows the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're calling Health Canada and you're
talking to Cheryl, try to be nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little extra patience with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people phone Health Canada often.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's pretty pissed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's, she's helped me out so much over
the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these people do, they have a
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like the officer in question that
was arresting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looked at me and I was telling him
about the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: how we teach each other and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Showed him my cervical leptomy fusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, this guy's mad at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What charges you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, charges me for having cream,
little, a MediClear distillate in the
[SPEAKER_01]: little fire ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, it was the other officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shame on Justin Trudeau.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually they didn't, they didn't pay
close enough attention telling me to,
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't want to call Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police have, they have the ability to
just ignore things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do it on a daily basis with certain
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they want to start harassing you,
there's always, you know, there's always
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to not do that, to read the
situation and be like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to put it together that
this guy actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to explain how now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get into this next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we can get our licenses back for those
of us that have destroyed or lost them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course I took notes, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All from Cheryl.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was telling me exactly what I need to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing you're going to need
to do, these are some good steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to request the copy
from Health Canada that you need a copy of
[SPEAKER_01]: your original license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both by email and mail.
No?
[SPEAKER_01]: Email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, oh no, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're going to get, oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your own notes I was reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was getting in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not fax.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going to mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's email.
[SPEAKER_01]: First you're going to email and then
you're going to directly mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the do not fax.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said do not fax.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do both of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mail and email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do both of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing you're going to do is
you're going to, I have to request a copy
[SPEAKER_01]: of my MMAR license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Include your full name, date of birth,
address on where the license was issued.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not your address.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had in this another thing I'll talk
about quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say you've moved and you're no longer
at that address.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still licensed to carry your
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means you're not licensed to grow
at that specific location.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why do you have to say anything that's
not the truth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can still get, well,
because if you want to continue to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you have to reapply through the
AMCPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: But say you don't want to continue to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want, you just want to possess
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have my, or you could say that
you haven't lost your license to grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've just lost your license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to include the following
information, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to include the address of
where the license was issued, your phone
[SPEAKER_01]: number, date and sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to date and sign this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to date and sign it and take a
valid copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be a valid copy of a piece of
government issue ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be a passport or your
driver's license.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't really anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to scan all this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice little letter, hi, I'm requesting a
copy of my original MMR license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to tell them that I lost it
or this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, you want a copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can request up to two copies because
someone like myself loses things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could get destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't laminate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously there's steps that you can
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually even take a picture of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's ways you can have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to put the information in
there, who you are, where the address,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it was issued, your date of birth,
your phone number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your email contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put this all into a little
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scan it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure to copy a valid ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to email this to omc-bcm
at hc-sc.gc.ca.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put that link up as well,
that email up on the screen for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I'm going to be doing this
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you guys know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Request a copy of my license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can request up to two copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also get two copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copy a valid government information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it into an envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then put this into an envelope and
send it for individuals seeking
[SPEAKER_01]: information about cannabis for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contact Health Canada toll-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got all the information right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark's going to put this all up for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's all the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can contact Health Canada for general
inquiries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the information here by mail,
where you're going to mail it to Health
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada address locator 0900 C2O.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ottawa, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's kilo one alpha zero kilo nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post the code.
[SPEAKER_01]: Information, email, and everything will
be, of course, scrolling by like he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scrolling up on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kind of makes life easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it all written out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly what Health Canada told me to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't like the lawyer or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this all myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawyer would have charged a few bucks
for this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then probably would have sold it
afterwards for more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's another step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So saying you didn't have a copy of your
license, like myself, the officer in
[SPEAKER_01]: question did not call Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go home and catch your
plane, or do you want to stay there for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple hours and be on hold?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go home.
[SPEAKER_01]: They delayed the plane for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got on the plane, and I took one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say take one for the cheat of your
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to get that hash back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're popping that hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing is I called Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then called a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Called Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Told them my situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Told them what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got all the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a copy of my license.
[SPEAKER_01]: March 31st.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've attached the letter in question of
how to contact law enforcement and what
[SPEAKER_01]: the law enforcement needs to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then got to hold the Crown Prosecutor in
Edmonton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to hold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you explain to him the situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't get an extent to talk to
John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So John was like, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was told by the secretary,
because he probably hasn't even received
[SPEAKER_01]: the charges yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might not even get them until the day
of court.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might not see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to speed up that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why waste taxpayers' money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why waste people's time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why send in lawyers and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, what I did is I went into
regards my case number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I attached some information regarding
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I faxed him a copy of what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually contacted the lady in
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Called her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She gave me the direct fax numbers to the
Crown Prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say you're being charged in any other
province or anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a federal offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not dealing with a provincial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're dealing with federal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then what I did is I've contacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the proper information to fax
this in and phone numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I scanned everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: A copy of my license.
[SPEAKER_01]: A copy of the information from Health
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a copy of the charges in question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sent it all in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And crossed my fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, they have to drop the charges.
It's 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to drop the charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, we had our friend get busted with
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 plants in his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't have his license yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a very good reason to have a
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just never got around to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he got charged, he immediately
went and got his license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not because he was charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it was time to A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect himself properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what he was doing wasn't what they
think he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was selling to the black market
versus growing for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he got a license with the help from
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess myself in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I hooked him up with Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was never known, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got all of his charges dropped soon
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a mandatory two and a half year
prison sentence he was facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his kids, you know, was everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it ended up being a real dream in the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important that people who are
medical have the protection of medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also important that we pass or
decriminalize or legalize because everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: deserves to be protected from cannabis
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking at legalization coming
next year, July 1st, 2018, apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: July 2018 is what they've said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Liberal Caucus has announced that
they're going to have legalization in
[SPEAKER_00]: motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of the points.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't seem to be too great.
[SPEAKER_00]: No hashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about just four plants per household?
[SPEAKER_00]: Limit on the plant, like 100 centimeters
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a foot in the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than nothing in the sense
that... Everybody can grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not everybody, every household.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if everyone was growing or a lot of
people were growing three or four plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to think that the smell is going
to be in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole foot in the door that made it
easy for people to be discovered will
[SPEAKER_00]: disappear when it's so normalized that
people all around are... Just smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like you smell skunk cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smell skunk cabbage, like skunk
cabbage smells very very much like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you, nobody has plans to
eradicate it or to get it out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ditches.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one complains about how horrible it
smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really what happens is if you smell it,
you go, that smells like really good weed
[SPEAKER_00]: or a skunk or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because it has that same sort
of terpene profile in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was going to make mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just thinking while I was looking
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the reason why you want to
request a copy of your license,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if you have the only original,
put that away, request a copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why Cheryl said this is
because you get a really nice cover letter
[SPEAKER_01]: to law enforcement stating exactly what to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't, she didn't tell me what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said request a copy and you get a
cover letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really, I can't wait to see your
cover letter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to show you my cover letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's do it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bon Rit, Mother Lupper.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is great stuff, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, we want it to really give you a
good puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although it might not have been quite
the adventure that John and I often go on
[SPEAKER_00]: or have as much squishing and,
and hash making, but good information is
[SPEAKER_00]: good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully the people in Canada can be
helped by this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you that have MMRs and
need to request, you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: information necessary to do so now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another thing that was quite
interesting is the office said,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you have a doctor's note?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my girlfriend said, I bet you've had a
doctor's note and a card that said a roar
[SPEAKER_01]: in your back pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would let you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting on how this new
system, cause I did have a fully expired
[SPEAKER_01]: card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like health Canada's got a
little bit more work to do in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not holding a stubborn like
childlike perspective on the MMR because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's over, but instead recognizing the
federal judges court order to uphold it
[SPEAKER_00]: and not ignore it, but actually maybe
focus on it head on, maybe even spend a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of money to do as much research
as they can to find the holes in this
[SPEAKER_00]: system and where it's been let down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the holes come from the
lack of communication from health Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: how small health Canada really is for this
particular job versus how many people are
[SPEAKER_00]: joining every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the absolute failure to properly
communicate with law enforcement to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect Canadian patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: The officer in question failed to do his
duty and call health Canada to verify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like here's another thing, educates all
police stations and all law enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: across Canada with this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a stretch, but you could literally be
helping people from great crimes because
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're not wasting the police's time
with victimless crimes that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually crimes, that are actually just a
complete and total waste of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: money, and more importantly, the duty of
protecting citizens that are in harm's way
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know somewhere there are
citizens in harm's way and if the police
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't wasting their time, with patients
like John, they would have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe spend more time trying to find those
crimes and those criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a stretch, I get it, but it's one
that could be made that makes proper sense
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look at it from the right
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three people lose, the taxpayer lose,
the cop loses, and then the person who he
[SPEAKER_00]: could be protecting also loses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I just saw this sitting there and
this is some trim bin sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some trim bin sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we run it through the squashy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we run it through the sauce?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's got a trim bin or if you don't,
you should get one because if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trimming your own and with this
legalization coming forward, everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to have a little bit of
their own sift and you're going to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to do all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to get screens and then we
can squish it, but I mean there's just
[SPEAKER_01]: ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this little thing, like this
little epicness and stuff like that that
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be able to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like came with this little tube,
kind of cool, and then you got the bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all taped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best part, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's with legalization coming on and
what's happening here in Canada and just
[SPEAKER_01]: with everybody being able to, every
household being able to grow up to four
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the near future, that means you guys
are all going to be able to, in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to harvest your own resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be able to get that first
little trim that comes off the plant in
[SPEAKER_01]: those bins or if you're using screens or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get this little epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I smell that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely needs to be in position.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can squish it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you squish it a bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can squish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, it's kind of gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty good stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't break up like poopy powder like
I thought it was going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually melty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some meltiness to it already.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to put it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of excitement going
on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always bring exciting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, wow, okay, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time you brought me hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were like, clean this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, what is this?
CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no glad hens in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, sure there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got a little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need that last little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I mean, like I said, probably
from a simple trim bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little system where there's two
bins put together and there's like 120 of
[SPEAKER_00]: them on my site, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're all about that stuff,
but these things work really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just when you're trimming these
of these guys got something larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me, myself, we got these screens above us
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're going to grab them down there
and show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a great little, two little
small screens that you guys can all pick
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to squish the shit out of
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to squish the shit out of
that, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can see the smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even kind of like already squishing
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, whoa, this is actually,
hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to do a pre-press.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an organic little grater,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a many one, girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, I kind of do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn it around and go to the press.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're over here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess we're going to do a little
press here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a little press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll just do a little lean over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually completely squished that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lean over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a little of a pre-press.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pre-press.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the last time you did it, it popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do got the arm, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm telling you, the last time you did
it was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm experienced, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to trust you,
John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if John blows it out.
It won't damage it.
I would crack it open here soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cake batter there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how thick that is on the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cake batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smells really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the old cake batter there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely tell that was probably
about at least 60%, 70% of the camel
[SPEAKER_01]: though, so you can feel how much is in
there, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be able to do a second squish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely didn't leave much oil on
that unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a bit on this edge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad, hey?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of like my first squish,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, with the Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: No blowout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of sat and watched the Sasquatch
guys in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the booth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to grab the dabble over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okie dokie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad, hey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we're losing our... So there's the
butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is the cheddar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tight pull and snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull and snap, rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus...
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're being recorded now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, hey.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: D420K is with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live by satellite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live by satellite right there,
D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just make you full screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just go fucking full screen,
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother lover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not pull that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother... I need a vlog file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dude, it's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, look what we just squished,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one squish, we produced two types of
rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the types?
[SPEAKER_00]: Butter and like a shatter consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's really buttery and one's like
shattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came off the same squish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the buttery one from a low temperature
press?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're both from the exact same
press.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one press.
[SPEAKER_00]: We opened it up and it was like half of it
was butter and half of it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: shattery consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hit that butter first.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have chewed if I would have blown
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what I think about it,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know after I hit both of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a better idea than where to hit
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, D420K.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bong rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bong ripping on both sides here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the whole thing is with the butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would say and how this whole thing
kind of played out is as I was squishing
[SPEAKER_01]: it before, I squished it really flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think by not squishing it, I thought
leaving that little gap, the other one
[SPEAKER_01]: squished out was more getting hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the lower temp is because it was
so thick it didn't heat up as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably, if I would have kept
going, it probably would have all came out
[SPEAKER_01]: like the shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the reason I didn't say what
I thought was almost exactly what he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just kind of makes sense,
you know, what's going on with that and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's just thinking about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was hot.
Yeah.
Son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like always to the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a ninja.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like ninja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me clean this for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one you can use so you don't burn
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the worst burning yourself on that
hot fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there is a little bit of...
That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the danger of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next on MSNBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You burned yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbers are burning themselves all over
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little finger dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, in 1986, we all had the little hot
knife lip mark.
Remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: 85, 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1985, Back to the Future came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, let's hit this, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little bit of... Let's get that on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's not leave it on there to the
point where it burns one of our fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be on that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about that, John?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when they used to ask the horse
how he felt about it on Ren and Stingy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd say, well, sir, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was real trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good old Ren and Stingy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know,
Google that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bit torrent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stream it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty acidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty weird out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when they're going door to door
selling rubber nipples and the guy answers
[SPEAKER_00]: the door by holding out his walrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the walrus is like, call the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to Google that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way, way, way more warped than Tom
and Jerry, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I'm getting right back in the
testing of the dabbing of the squishing of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ouch.
Ouch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, going into the shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into the shatter?
[SPEAKER_00]: That pull and snap texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a caramel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even snapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just like a caramel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a dry sift out of the trim bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, MKUltra dry sift out of the trim
bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty darn nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you think we were talking about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I got a whole bunch of real pretty
clean stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll clean her up real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to broker this deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny's brokering the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already brokered the deal,
so just so you know, I'll be taking 20% of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, he just said 60 at the start,
so he's already down 40% from his initial
[SPEAKER_00]: grasp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You going to try that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even see you hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was the snappy snappy as opposed to
the buttery buttery?
[SPEAKER_00]: Taste-wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to want the buttery buttery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the snappy snappy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: You prefer it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to burn me when you pass it
to me?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't do that to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't hand him a hot one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's like, ow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you handed it to me in a way that I
almost had to grab it by the hot part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to put the resin stamp on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was trying to get me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's resin stamps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get stamped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a resin stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a round little stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be my last Puff Wednesday
puff, and then we're going to put the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera on D, and he's going to take us out
with a giant, giant, like four gram dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the ball rig going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your dab ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be on camera after this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's next.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a little bit of some
controversy here talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: different flavors, different textures,
and just the different, what happened
[SPEAKER_01]: here?
[SPEAKER_01]: One or two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, they both taste great, but different
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The butter is more fruity, and the shatter
one is just, it's more like, I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how it sits on the tongue,
though?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more curvy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting on how, and I think
Darren might have hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not the strain or the
cultivar that he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I said that, I think it might be a
mixed bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something got in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smelt a little bit of the haze in there
that is often associated with an MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, have you done any squishes
like this where we're getting two
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of the same squish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite to that extent of even amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was so pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so pronounced on the, well,
you guys saw, we showed it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera, but it was definitely pronounced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't it be nice to know the thickness
and all that whole thing will happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, you hate it when it only happens
once, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Darren, like, hey, he wasn't in the
bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: D420K is going to take us out with the
bong rip, Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: D420K taking us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sure it's songless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, isn't that guy in Shooter,
that Mark Wahlberg movie?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he was killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shot in the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was he?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace, boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace, Darren.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
