[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble man here in the makeshift grow room
that Ron just put together Not sure if I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: getting cut off right here, but you put
this table together about some screens
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to kind of be in and out of
the room Getting this table ready for some
[SPEAKER_02]: stand-up dry sifting and yeah,
we'll be back
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect yeah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey what we lose we lose
[SPEAKER_03]: So that you're gonna put up on here yes
You got that I sure do buddy Just get it
[SPEAKER_01]: on there The glass is the face up,
okay, so this is down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said it's face up It doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where all the hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just listen because I can't hold this up
any longer so you just have to execute
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm doing Now that's no I want you to
put it on the face up Yes, face up that
[SPEAKER_02]: way is face up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but don't know it's not Thank you
for not like sometimes you don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand you just This is real heavy for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a hard time holding it in fact
We think there is like five six seven
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds No, I don't know to do this that
looks like at least Two things still
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a lot of weed I'm going to figure
this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is my 300.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a screen That we'll put aside
In here no, that's not a good spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking maybe possibly right here Put
this guy this is a 50 micron screen
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing falls through it Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that'll be safe there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put these blocks underneath this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So yeah, if you lift this screen up a
bit you'll see that But the majority of
[SPEAKER_02]: that resin this resin right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's right there I had already felt with
my fingers on the other side the side that
[SPEAKER_02]: had the herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not where the resin was Absolutely
great hopefully hopefully worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what else could we use we could use
[SPEAKER_02]: All right,
[SPEAKER_02]: so We've got a couple of pounds of herb on
our 200 lines per inch screen this is 140
[SPEAKER_02]: micron 140 micron this screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all buds popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is definitely like people would buy
this this is 100% like sellable herb But
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not going to be doing that with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be extracting the resin off
of it We've also got some of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is Herb that was run through the
spin Pro I'm not sure if you guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with the little spin Pro one of
the trimming machines But that is what
[SPEAKER_02]: that was run through with these are just
little popcorn buds bottoms of the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that never really you know, there's still
some substantial nugs and they are
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly dried so Should be good So I've
got a piece of glass here that I'm using
[SPEAKER_02]: as the base I usually go right on to a 70
micron but I've got The glass here it
[SPEAKER_02]: should make for nice Photographic and
video There's already a tiny bit of dry
[SPEAKER_02]: sit on this just from Who this looks like
it's been really dried properly wrong,
[SPEAKER_02]: huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it's been well dried It's
the resin is very orange Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's set up our screen Do I get in
the way of the camera card over there if
[SPEAKER_01]: you stand right in front of it,
you'll be in the way All right,
[SPEAKER_02]: so Almost did you bring that in?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I think what a good idea
will be is to for us To put some of this
[SPEAKER_02]: herb in this bin and make make some room
off of our table Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not like you can't dry sift with this
much material on a screen I Find it's nice
[SPEAKER_02]: to just make a little bit of room.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a lot of material I know you did
you don't think so, but please this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of pounds Okay there, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll put this right here Right next to
your element there thermometer Try to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: clean and try to make a nice clean We
don't want If you ended up on right here,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna end up going
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not it's nice to have you
know, it'll be nice to see the resin
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny no, no, that's how it works
So I'm just gently Sort of gently remove
[SPEAKER_02]: moving the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you check the back of the camera
screen and see if my head's cut off at
[SPEAKER_02]: all?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right in there, but But is my head
out of the camera shot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like to know I hate to do videos
for you guys and then have to be like
[SPEAKER_02]: halfway out of the camera or something
Yeah, so Yeah, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look under here Ron while I'm
moving this around you can see the resin
[SPEAKER_02]: falling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Nice now the more Aggressive I am the
more contaminant will go through now,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course It's always easy making hash
with half a pound bone dry, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't a real Difficult thing we're
going to get a good amount just because
[SPEAKER_02]: we're using a good amount so I'll gently
move these buds around and then what I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: do is we'll lift the screen up and We'll
check the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll pile it all up with the card into my
first pile and from there I'll dry sift
[SPEAKER_02]: probably more with this particular
material and I'll put the second wash of
[SPEAKER_02]: this material over here Not that it's a
wash but the second sift and I sort of do
[SPEAKER_02]: that with each material when I'm done this
I'll put it in another bucket and we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: take the fresh out of here and we'll sift
that and that First sift will go into the
[SPEAKER_02]: pile next to the pile of this first sift
Once I get those piles, then I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: clean each one Individually through the
tighter screen which is sitting over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be doing carding techniques and You
know, it's funny right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not super warm in here But I can
easily be outside doing this right now I
[SPEAKER_02]: think when we do the cleaning on the
second screen, we'll go outside and do
[SPEAKER_02]: that part We got the cold why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll probably show you that guys that
tomorrow morning so all right,
[SPEAKER_02]: so What was that a couple minutes that
wasn't much rubbing at all in four minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so put a little bit of pow-pow there
We'll be gentle though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see how stuff somehow managed to get
through it was probably there before I
[SPEAKER_02]: Thought I had cleaned the glass super
good, but it's very easy for little
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also wet cleaned Underneath the glass
Because sometimes if a leaf is under the
[SPEAKER_02]: glass and you think you know You think
it's over the glass you kind of try to
[SPEAKER_02]: clean it a little harder than
[SPEAKER_02]: Really loving the color on nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a really you know when you're
making dry sift I know people think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: great to see this golden or this white
almost clear hash You know those are
[SPEAKER_02]: immature heads that have not been cured
This is hash that fresh frozen basically
[SPEAKER_02]: right you take the fresh frozen up,
but when you run it it makes beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: bubbles But it doesn't have that same like
dry cured look that you get from from the
[SPEAKER_02]: dry sift What do you think of that little
pile Ron?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it was very gentle the quality
looks like it's there and Of course I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: need to clean it Yeah, we're dry sifting
here Darren.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just doing our dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it going on We're making a little
video for YouTube, so we've done our first
[SPEAKER_02]: Screening we'll probably go back to doing
much more of the same thing and Once I've
[SPEAKER_02]: got a bunch more piles of this we're going
to come back and we're going to do our
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary screen So we'll see you in just
a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I have since doubled my Producing
abilities I've got my second set of
[SPEAKER_02]: screens here on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my 110 This is the 140 microns and
then underneath that I've got a 70 micron
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've got cardboard Under that we're
not going to be carding anything right
[SPEAKER_02]: here, but I thought at least it would be a
good idea to get this material Some of it
[SPEAKER_02]: out on the screen thinking if I can get
most of it I'll be able to use this
[SPEAKER_02]: container To pick up some of this material
we've already run so
[SPEAKER_02]: Scoop it right into the bucket Doesn't
matter if I get all hundred percent of it
[SPEAKER_02]: basically I just This is material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've run once And so I'm putting it over
to the side for now You're actually Some
[SPEAKER_02]: of this guy over Clean the screen a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always want to make sure you're over
glass If you don't have your cardboard,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the nice thing about having the
cardboard piece taped under the other
[SPEAKER_02]: screen now keep in mind I have two screens
and the rest is only going to fall onto
[SPEAKER_02]: the second screen That second screen is
not going to be releasing anything readily
[SPEAKER_02]: Through it that's really where you have to
do the carding work And that doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: happen just easily so We're okay Very
tough work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to not have the space that I
have between these two screens right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting a lot of contaminant So what I
think I'm going to do is lift this up Push
[SPEAKER_02]: it right to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want that contaminant falling
through it's Cleanliness is godliness in
[SPEAKER_02]: this you really want to keep a nice clean
area You don't want to be too violent of
[SPEAKER_02]: course this work can be done with a
tumbler.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need To do this the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the hands-on feeling I like the
hands-on approach it lets me know the
[SPEAKER_02]: resin that I'm working with How sticky it
is how much is present just from doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: quick little bounce like this and of
course We'll probably bubble all of this
[SPEAKER_02]: material when we're done, so I'm going to
be doing this for a short bit longer We'll
[SPEAKER_02]: show you what we got All right,
so we've gently Gently rub the buds over
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of the screen we're going to sort
Of lift it up real gently here and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what we've what we've acquired a
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice color Right texture it's very
grainy and say we We got a real nice
[SPEAKER_02]: material out of this
[SPEAKER_02]: All right time to make some dry sift It's
cold night out there boy
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice and cold Nice
[SPEAKER_02]: and cold All
[SPEAKER_02]: right, so this bud is cold just came out
of I don't know minus 10 So I can feel the
[SPEAKER_02]: cold in this bud Nice material to be dry
sifting And I'm putting quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: material on there, but why not we can Just
do some nice gentle I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: carding this material that's how I'm going
to go about cleaning it I do have a
[SPEAKER_02]: variety of ways I can go about cleaning it
the way I'm going to go about cleaning it
[SPEAKER_02]: is a carding technique and it's easier if
I'm gentle with the resin rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: Extreme, so you don't want to really like
be super violent with it You can if you
[SPEAKER_02]: want, but you're going to be spending more
time cleaning that resin It's not really
[SPEAKER_02]: worth the feeling of like oh, yeah,
I got so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you got so much contaminant I
just really want the Heddy's so we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: start grinding down some of the popcorn
nugs To access those this is extremely dry
[SPEAKER_02]: material which is great for dry sifting
people ask me all the time hey Does it
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be dry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right in the name first word dry dry
sifting dry material It's a good idea to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want it dry and Really some of the most
successful stuff is This doesn't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: sit there in the light like that
[SPEAKER_00]: all right
[SPEAKER_02]: To keep a nice clean zone when I'm dry
sifting I Don't mind if the leaf goes on
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground, but I really hate it being on
my underlining glass I hate it being on
[SPEAKER_02]: the glass anywhere actually I would
normally if you are going to cut glass for
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom of your screen I would cut it
the same size as the frame of your screen
[SPEAKER_02]: not bigger that way when leafs go over the
frame that you won't be in a situation
[SPEAKER_02]: where It's it ends up falling on the glass
and then I walk by and I blow it under and
[SPEAKER_02]: then when I lift up the screen and look
You know you end up finding buds like that
[SPEAKER_02]: so Let's check and see what we've got Just
gently put here nice and gentle and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what we've got
[SPEAKER_02]: Great color on this resin not sure how
well all of you can see but It is really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice color resin
[SPEAKER_02]: So not a ginormous amount by anyone's
standards, but you know another nice
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary pile of
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'll just I guess we pull up
Metal card that I have for the glass it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: probably work pretty good Using
[SPEAKER_02]: a V syndicate nice little glass bubble man
card got a couple of piles there
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so there's our material You got
a little hair in there and some other
[SPEAKER_02]: things it's by no means pure heads I would
say that it's Probably a good 70%
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminant, but that's not to be really
That's not a huge surprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was Making it quite roughly
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and there's our other little
pile Doing great All
[SPEAKER_02]: right, so we've done a bunch of dry
sifting Not a bunch, but a little bit and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to take this screen Just place
it gently over here Never a bad idea to
[SPEAKER_02]: have these little guys helping you out as
well I don't actually have them over here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's a good idea if you do have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going Ron?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so check it out That's a good
pile a So that's gonna be still clean day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm gonna clean it All I know is I
want it I want us to have it's a great
[SPEAKER_02]: color nice color we should have This is
properly cured Resin and I was trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: explain to the people out there that you
know nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a young group of people making this
Making water hash and they're all really
[SPEAKER_02]: stoked on fresh Frozen so the resin glands
never really have any time to to dry
[SPEAKER_02]: properly to cure properly and when I mean
cure I mean the difference between the
[SPEAKER_02]: resin The wax membrane drying and
shriveling up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really see it in macro
photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can show you the pictures and The
difference between a swollen full head
[SPEAKER_02]: that's got moisture in it clearly still
and one that doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: Well because it's still gonna be
contaminated by you know, I'd say at least
[SPEAKER_02]: 70% Maybe 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that doesn't mean I won't get
like at least two piles out of this pile
[SPEAKER_02]: here I'm making a pile like that of pure
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Listen, it's gonna be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's always worth the time So
because it's always that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice even if you can use
[SPEAKER_03]: All right,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we've gotten to the next step here we
had the 110 line per inch screens which
[SPEAKER_02]: are 140 micron those 140 micron screens
that I was bouncing the three to four
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds over I was bouncing gently at first
got a little more rough later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to get a ton I'm trying to
get Quality I managed to get these two
[SPEAKER_02]: piles here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This pile actually looks quite Decent even
as you see as I broke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the whole thing moved as a
pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good sign still probably 60%
contaminant and then over here on my
[SPEAKER_02]: screen on my 70 micron screen this is a
200 lines per inch and 200 lines per inch
[SPEAKER_02]: screen 70 microns is the screen that will
work with to do our carding so I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of cardboard like this Taped to the
bottom of this screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really going to put a lot of
material through but I'll actually end up
[SPEAKER_02]: working on this screen the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get all this resin off put it
on the glass And then I'm going to flip
[SPEAKER_02]: this screen over and I'll actually work on
the glass with the cardboard off because I
[SPEAKER_02]: like to work on the top of the screen when
I'm doing this part I don't like to be in
[SPEAKER_02]: the screen you know but it like the way it
works out with the herbs that's great but
[SPEAKER_02]: this was a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright so real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright clean off the resin off of that
screen then we will take the tape off the
[SPEAKER_02]: sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just came over today on the plane that's
why I originally taped these up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always nervous with my screens that
they're going to be punctured.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really want them to be punctured
so when you travel with them it's a good
[SPEAKER_02]: idea to have them protected like this and
this is just a nice thick corrugated
[SPEAKER_02]: plywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll protect your screens and I'm sure
that some ice wax guy out there is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to say hey you can just use parchment
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me parchment paper is not thick
enough to protect your screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to want a nice thick
cardboard for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright so we got this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll kind of get this ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a little bit of resin on this screen
so we might as well save it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make a nice picture probably do it
tomorrow but yeah getting a picture of
[SPEAKER_02]: just the heads on the glass would be nice
I'm certain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright so let's see bring these guys all
the way over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright nice working space for our screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've got a great size screen you
understand that you don't need to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: pound of resin to work with to warrant
this size screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's doable with a smaller amount you can
keep your separate grades here at the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom and then slowly work your carded
resin in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now some of you might not understand what
I mean by carded.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to show some photos in this
tutorial of trichomes and right now I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be showing one so when you look
at this trichome you'll see that it has a
[SPEAKER_02]: long capitate stalk that's its body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows out of a leaf the cannabis plant
and then on top there's a nice bulbous
[SPEAKER_02]: head and inside that head are all the
wonderful medicinal benefits that we get
[SPEAKER_02]: from cannabis as well as the terpenes and
the terpenoids, the flavors and the
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all in this glandular trichome
head and so when we make a dry sift single
[SPEAKER_02]: screen extraction what we get are
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get the glandular head, we get the
capitate stalk, we get the systolic hair
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a non glandular material that
looks like a capitate stalk but it has no
[SPEAKER_02]: head and it kind of points out at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show one of those as well and what
these things are is they're gold to look
[SPEAKER_02]: at to the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they're mixed with heads they look
gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think you might have gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can guarantee you this is massively
contaminated because we've only run it
[SPEAKER_02]: through the one screen and we weren't
uber, uber gentle.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to do now is I'm going to take
this, actually I think we should do this
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll set this up outside and we'll be
right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey how's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm out in the Kootenays in some beautiful
minus 10 or so weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of a chilly night.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of snow all around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron's been so gracious as to light me up
with the T5 so we've got some good light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured it was a good idea to come out
here to do the final part of the process
[SPEAKER_02]: and what that is, we've already single
screen sifted our dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got three decent piles right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a couple of different cards I'm
going to be playing around with,
[SPEAKER_02]: different thicknesses of plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy Darren talks about having some
good luck with the iTunes plastic card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Says he's collecting a lot of contaminant
on one side and heads on the other so
[SPEAKER_02]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can experiment with a little bit of
that but mostly what I want to do today is
[SPEAKER_02]: show you the simple process of carding the
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can already feel the resin's cold and I
love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that it's cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great environment for dry
sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to spread our resin across the
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and gently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it nicely spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much the way I tell people when they're
drying bubble, the thinner spread you can
[SPEAKER_02]: get it, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few little pieces of contaminant there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just gently carding it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this screen is quite light,
or this card I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a thicker card here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm used to a card more along this lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can really press it through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be too hard when I'm
pressing but definitely want to do some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that pressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind this dry sift is probably 70%
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to be dry sifting in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to be surrounded by snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope tomorrow to make some bubble hash
using snow to cool our water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll still use some ice to actually break
the heads off of their bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to use snow to cool the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we cool the water with the snow we
will filter that water through a 25 micron
[SPEAKER_02]: bag and remove any dust, debris,
rocks, any dirt that would be in the snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using pretty clean snow that we find
just up the mountain behind my buddy's
[SPEAKER_02]: place here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still can have some dirt in it so it's
good to clean out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This process is a very slow process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one that you're going to do
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's counter intuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The faster you try, the slower your work
will become.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say enough about the cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really making the resin feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also should mention I have a piece of
cardboard that I've placed underneath this
[SPEAKER_02]: screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same size as the screen frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that it's going to capture a lot of
valuable things but any heads that are
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller than 70 micron and a lot of
capitate stocks and systolic hairs will
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually be pushed through this screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it's a good idea to have
something to capture that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use plexiglass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used cardboard in this instance because
it was easy to bring it outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glass is a little bit more dangerous to
move and it makes things heavier.
[SPEAKER_02]: This table is a little bit shaky as well
so I didn't want heavy glass on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cardboard works great for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just collecting resin that I'm mostly
using in Metables.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a small pile of dry sift like this you
can easily work it for 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30, even 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that time you would clean this pile
down to anywhere from down to 20% of
[SPEAKER_02]: what's here to even down as far as 5 to
10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty incredible how much you can
lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm noticing in the cold here that the
resin's not sticking to my card.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really quite happy with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't be filming the whole time I card
all these resins out but I'll end up
[SPEAKER_02]: showing you some photos of the before,
the some, during and the eventual after of
[SPEAKER_02]: the product that I make.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just thought I'd show you a cool simple
way to do some dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your first screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're buying a mesh screen please
understand that it's marked lines per
[SPEAKER_02]: inch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's silk.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy silk screen it's always going
to be in lines per inch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go asking for micron sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you a quick explanation
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two screens that I promote for my dry
sifting are a 110 line per inch.
[SPEAKER_02]: A 110 is actually a 140 micron.
[SPEAKER_02]: The secondary screen that I'm using is a
200 lines per inch screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This screen is actually 70 microns.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see with lines per inch as the number
gets higher the hole actually gets
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very confusing to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't understand the differences
between the lines per inch and the micron.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are simple conversion charts that
you can Google and find online.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also buy the book Hashish by
Robert Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a wonderful conversion chart in
there as well as incredible information
[SPEAKER_02]: both historically and the technical
aspects of making hash and even the
[SPEAKER_02]: science behind the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I urge you to pick that book up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course Amazon and all these places have
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell it as well at freshheadies.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to keep on doing a little bit of
dry sifting out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 2 o'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk to you guys soon in Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
