[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, hello welcome everybody to bubble
man's world I am back today again with
[SPEAKER_00]: Sabo and we are going to sit down and do a
little bit of a sort of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversation while we enjoy a couple of
vape exhales mine turned down
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially the way I like it his turned
up a little Bit more yep about the one o
[SPEAKER_00]: 'clock setting here clock setting,
and I'm down at what you would say maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven o'clock seven o'clock yes,
maybe seven o'clock a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter lighter hit that takes a bit
longer to give that smoky rip,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, we've got eight quartz tubes
here that are nice and Clean and ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: for dipping three varieties of rosin,
so we've got a hash plant We've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet skunk and we've got a conga leaf And
then we also have seven varieties of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes two in the closed packages here
the Blue River We got Swiss tsunami and
[SPEAKER_00]: the AC DC both high CBD Cultivars actually
not that there's any cannabinoids in there
[SPEAKER_00]: But still they are the profiles that come
from a high CBD cultivar, and I'm of the
[SPEAKER_00]: firm belief that those ratios of terpenes
synergize and modulate CBD a Particular
[SPEAKER_00]: way I think probably in a better way Than
just extracting out CBD by itself
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I will be Curious to try and you know
I love the taste of CBD strains in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, so I'm sure I will yeah They
always have a bit of a cherry-esque sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of nice terpene flavor to it That's a
great description also excited to show you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys this new little piece here a step in
the right Direction for me now don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the pipe that came with the vape
exhale It was thick and strong it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like you know inexpensively Glass
that you didn't get your money's worth I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt that it was a nice heavy thick piece
and the way it fit on the unit I loved as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, but coming from the perspective of
someone that collects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know even though they're clear fairly
expensive glass pipes I think it's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: idea to offer an option that doesn't
involve The tube which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hit it before out of the sublimator,
and I've used the one for the vape exhale
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love the idea of preserving it in
glass Me too as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the the silicone hose was
designed more for usability and
[SPEAKER_01]: utilitarian purposes, but I I am like you
you know I love collecting really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: glass and Many times when you have a
silicone hose in between a high-end
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizer and a top-notch mothership like
this one You know it's almost like a one
[SPEAKER_01]: of these things doesn't belong with the
other so we decided to create this all
[SPEAKER_01]: glass Connector here, and you know this is
just The version one of it you know we
[SPEAKER_01]: think that based on the time I spent with
you and Dee yesterday You know there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some improvements that we can make but at
least it's a step in the right direction
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know really excited to to show
everyone how it works as well as to taste
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this Absolutely this in front of us
and by no means am I saying that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the better there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quiver Sable and I are quiver guys
We like to have more than one option
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know there are more than one
type of person out there And what's great
[SPEAKER_00]: for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: may not be great for the next person so
the silicone tube is actually going to is
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely going to find its place with
certain people and The the glass on glass
[SPEAKER_00]: accessories are going to find their place
people have different preferences and for
[SPEAKER_00]: me The taste of the vape exhale the way
the heat heats up the quartz in the little
[SPEAKER_00]: tube of glass that sort of convection
style of heating It offers me such a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully preserved hit that I want to
take it through glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to go Right through glass right
to glass and for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do obviously notice a difference in in
in the hit So I'm quite excited to get
[SPEAKER_00]: this Get this little gauntlet going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely me too and to your point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I've never been one to say one is
better than the other I like to have
[SPEAKER_01]: options as well when people ask me You
know what's my favorite piece of glass or
[SPEAKER_01]: what's my favorite hydro tube that goes on
top?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know typically my response is
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't use yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know like I get used to The different
pool and feelings of certain pieces of
[SPEAKER_01]: glass and you know for me Just having that
variety really keeps things new and fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: for me I think it's an incredibly
important perspective for us to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: although You know when you find something
that's great, and you want to share it
[SPEAKER_00]: with your friends, and you're inspired
It's important that you don't let your ego
[SPEAKER_00]: get too involved and where you want to
enforce That this is the best better way
[SPEAKER_00]: by all means show your friends things and
inspire them to do things differently but
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that there are a lot of
different people out there and for me who
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes to mind right away is Irv Rosenfield
one of the two or three legal federally
[SPEAKER_00]: exempt cannabis users in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with LV musica he gets the big cans
of joints hundred of them every month from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mississippi facility and we have one
hash church and we were talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of this bud and of course it's
swag and they're grinding up all the stock
[SPEAKER_00]: and this that and the other thing and all
of these connoisseurs in the room are
[SPEAKER_00]: saying we got to get you better product
Irv and that's just ridiculous and and
[SPEAKER_00]: then Irv just came up with this most
beautiful perspective that none of us had
[SPEAKER_00]: and he said guys This works for me This is
working for me and in that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized Then he should have access to
that we can never make access only what we
[SPEAKER_00]: think is best or what we want as best But
we need to open our minds and hearts up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunities of the quiver all of the
options that we can bring to the table and
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few good options here on the
table today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you thinking you want to start
with you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Had the Congolese yesterday, so maybe Was
it the super stunk or we got the sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk and then we got a little bit of hash
plant here as well That's this one's nice
[SPEAKER_00]: because it has not as strong of a presence
as the other ones It's almost closer to a
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate even though it's not it has a
terpene profile, but a lower profile From
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm used to in these other more
narrow leaf drug cultivars This is a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf drug cultivar and I find that when
You dip it into the terpene you really
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that particular term that
you're dipping so this is more like a
[SPEAKER_00]: blank canvas It's it's closer to a blank
canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the reason I brought that one
I thought these ones are amazing to mix
[SPEAKER_00]: because their profiles are so unique even
without adding terpenes But this one is
[SPEAKER_00]: really one that is more closer to you know
pure cannabinoids with a terpene profile
[SPEAKER_01]: added Yeah, and this parchment paper is
really top-notch as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anyone could see this well
Let's give a shout out To snick and the
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 parchment crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great concept and idea and I'm
glad that you mentioned it They come out
[SPEAKER_00]: with these little squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wonderful for For companies even
like vapix hail or any company that wants
[SPEAKER_00]: their logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost done in like a braille So it's
raised so we put the rosin in and you peel
[SPEAKER_00]: it open You see the letter printed in the
rosin to the crown of the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very cool Yeah, I like that
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do let's start off with a little
hit of this and what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking Maybe grape ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's the first one that was staring
at me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give it a little whiff now I will
say a neat thing about the vapix hail as
[SPEAKER_00]: we're about to hit some terpenes mixed
with some some rosin is that Sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first units I use that actually allowed me
to hit pure terpenes in a way that I felt
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were preserved enough that I
would actually do that because before I
[SPEAKER_00]: was Dabbing pure drops on a nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it to be a little bit harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just the direct grill style of heat
that conduction was just too much compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to the light preservation of this
convection style unit and Well Brett and I
[SPEAKER_00]: from West Coast concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we did like 10 or 15 Terpenes a
gauntlet right at this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all the gauntlets have been done
right at this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh the first Yes, the first D420k gauntlet
that we did 18 flavors was here and then
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett and I did the 10 or the 12 whatever
that was and now you and I are Going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: just a mini one just a mini one for for
for each because we have four clean tubes
[SPEAKER_00]: But that leaves at least three terpenes
that we're not going to experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always got off-camera Yeah,
we could do those off-camera Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do do do do I usually get a little I
usually heat this up a tiny bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I should we should be fine So what I
like about what you said earlier about
[SPEAKER_01]: having the multiple quivers is you know
There are certain concentrates and
[SPEAKER_01]: certain, you know forms that I feel like
you know might be better for dabbing and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's other things like
concentrates and what we're doing today
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think you know really work well
with our convection based methodology,
[SPEAKER_01]: but ultimately, you know, I feel like If
you can find a safe easy effective
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent healthy way to consume your
concentrates You know whether it's a low
[SPEAKER_01]: temp nail or through a device like this,
you know, these are all positive
[SPEAKER_01]: directions to go in and remove You know
the smoke and carcinogens from your from
[SPEAKER_00]: your lungs just a small little dab to give
you guys an idea I'm not sure how well you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see that but it's it's nothing major
that we're putting in here We're gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: a little gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not gonna be packing these in but
by all means you Are welcome to all right
[SPEAKER_01]: first go cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much So I'll try to do it at
an angle where people can see what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah your carb perfect So we could already
see the first bits of vapor coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna lock that This in right here and
here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is just shatter Wow That was
really tasty that was the the ghost that
[SPEAKER_00]: was the ghost All sorts of interesting
things going on in that flavor profile
[SPEAKER_00]: Got me excited here geez Yeah,
it's an impressive little unit you've
[SPEAKER_00]: built here, I'm not gonna lie when I first
saw it I was like, oh, okay It's like it
[SPEAKER_00]: reminds me of a few other units that I've
seen and I wasn't you know as excited and
[SPEAKER_00]: then Tony said that he had tried it and he
was like No, you have to try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always blown away by any unit that can
taste as good as like a big dab off of a
[SPEAKER_00]: nail through my through my mothership and
The vapix Hale definitely has that hands
[SPEAKER_00]: down and that's why I so wanted to be able
to hit it through my mother's This is a
[SPEAKER_01]: treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you And I don't know if we're
filming in high enough definition,
[SPEAKER_01]: but anytime I take these turps I get crazy
goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do that is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean there there's no denying that
reaction It was almost like when I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: the hospital with d420k and we visited
Johnny B after he had his neck surgery his
[SPEAKER_00]: spinal column was Being flattened and so
they released this one of his vertebrates
[SPEAKER_00]: off of it and they were worried that it
was gonna blow up like a balloon and just
[SPEAKER_00]: pop because your spinal cord is very much
like a little balloon and his was
[SPEAKER_00]: flattened well when the pressure relieved
It worked out in his favor and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely, you know The pain that he was
out of was incredible but he was still
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously sore in the hospital bed having
just had spinal surgery and We go there
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was the purple punch that I pulled
out and I put under his name under his
[SPEAKER_00]: name and literally in a second he was like
He felt a shift in his consciousness and
[SPEAKER_00]: the way the pain was being experienced and
it was a very short shift He said it just
[SPEAKER_00]: went away and he was he was blown away at
how powerful just inhaling smelling a
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene not vaporizing Just the terpene,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so mine's at a lower temperature
That's why I talked a little bit and let
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of get going We spoke about this
yesterday at the cchq, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: so as the Glass tube is in the heating
chamber longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does continue to build up heat So
bubble man here is at the lowest
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, which is roughly 225 degrees
and it's sitting there baking in the hot
[SPEAKER_01]: air oven He'll get probably four to six
inhalations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got two to three at the one o'clock
position, which is closer to 375 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, the great thing is whether
you're a high temp low temp You know
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere in between type of dabber you'll
be able to have the control to get These
[SPEAKER_01]: hot air dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god delicious and it immediately
felt under my eyes like inside my head
[SPEAKER_00]: Right under my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can literally feel that's those terpenes
getting it right To me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing that we have all these
different Compounds that we can now use
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's as important to have mechanisms
that allow us to vaporize them on
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterated and unchanged Yeah,
that's the important factor that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so I mean, I think a good
analogy is you know, it's like If you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a Kobe beef, you know, you get a steak of
it It's it's taken so much time to to
[SPEAKER_01]: create something like that And if you were
to let's just say make ground beef out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it and make hamburgers Well, it could be
you know almost you know a bad use of it
[SPEAKER_01]: so when I saw what you and Tony were doing
with these terpenes and I just knew that
[SPEAKER_01]: this would be a device that would really
kind of you know help people enjoy it at a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher level and Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean all the the amount of plant that is
required to create just this amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes I mean, you know, it really is
like liquid gold or or liquid platinum
[SPEAKER_01]: because the therapeutic utility that I get
from this it's it's on another level with
[SPEAKER_01]: the concentrates and I'll be very curious
as to hear what you know what the research
[SPEAKER_01]: and science has to say as to why we feel
this way when we add more terpenes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but There's gonna be a lot of
people focused on this in the upcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: years and I think it's gonna be important
for us not to React in this sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you think it's like no Let's
embrace all of these people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming into this part of the industry the
people that are gonna get PhDs and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna learn chemistry so that they can
study these molecules and and explain
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the pathways of the relationships
that are occurring underlining that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't yet understand especially in regards
to how the interaction occurs in our own
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid systems, which is It's an
incredible amount of science even if we
[SPEAKER_00]: were just to pick you and one cultivar
That's an incredible amount of science
[SPEAKER_00]: once we break it into the world and all of
the cultivars that are available Including
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones we can produce through breeding
It makes the hair on my arms Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: well what's interesting is I'm gonna be
very curious about the CBD turps and how
[SPEAKER_01]: they affect the body and if that's a good
way for people To you know get that into
[SPEAKER_01]: their system I mean one of the biggest
things that we've seen especially with the
[SPEAKER_01]: professional athletes like Eugene Monroe
Boo Williams Taryn Jones is when they are
[SPEAKER_01]: able to consume larger amounts of CBD per
inhalation, you know They feel a
[SPEAKER_01]: substantially different effect and why you
know, we've been really promoting CBD use
[SPEAKER_01]: with our device We're getting one over to
Nate Diaz as well who had been using the
[SPEAKER_01]: pen, but for whatever reason, you know
when the CBD Is combined with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these turps, you know, we're noticing a
much higher level of pain relief for these
[SPEAKER_01]: athletes And you know, it's essentially
why I've been getting goosebumps every
[SPEAKER_01]: time I've been, you know fortunate enough
to experience that myself There you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the same rosin with now the
Covillo or Covello I'm not sure how you
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounce that Valley in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do it injustice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the sour diesel terpenes Oh
sour diesel give you a nice little dip
[SPEAKER_00]: there and a nice reasonable size rip that
the efficiency of this unit is also You
[SPEAKER_00]: put in big monster dabs and you're
definitely not going to be getting through
[SPEAKER_00]: five or ten of them in a row because what
one big monster dab will be Like 15 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: hits I got three light One really good one
and a couple of light ones after that out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the one I put in but I put in a really
small dab Like substantially small I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: him a little bit bigger one This time
around and I'll take a bigger one as well
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice to see there's something really
quite Rewarding about seeing a clear piece
[SPEAKER_00]: fill up with vapor and I also like
watching it travel down this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Do never get tired of watching it that's
for sure And if they're obviously this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning right now I picture maybe a
little stand that's custom-built for your
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe or whatever that your pipe is in
place The unit is in place and it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: one unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not having to hold it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But truly it's it might It's not as
awkward as it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't trust just anyone with it That
being said this would definitely not be
[SPEAKER_00]: the good idea to go down to the cchq
Lounge and just blaze everyone down and go
[SPEAKER_00]: here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you just fit it right into there
Definitely someone along the line is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but you don't want them to do but
It's working great for us Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the idea of a stand like this that
can go up and down right into this That's
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is locked in we didn't really do
this properly But this is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful stand that sable brought As a
gift it fits all of these little these
[SPEAKER_00]: little units I think we're gonna get ones
with holes drilled that fit the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: jars I can picture that in the future for
sure at least Blue River versions and then
[SPEAKER_00]: also the the little mechanism here that
maybe Attaches through holes so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: use different size ones that fits the pipe
right into the unit You know then then
[SPEAKER_00]: when you move the whole unit It would I
would also maybe put like a nice felt We
[SPEAKER_01]: have a rubber feet, but we have felt feet
too that we could put on the bottom But I
[SPEAKER_01]: like the way this locks in so it doesn't
get knocked over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get your rip?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get my rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, dude I wasn't even like
paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny when you're just loading,
you know Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using the dab tender.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel blessed to have someone Do it
for me for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I'm doing it justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are, you know You never you never want
to use someone's unit in a way That is
[SPEAKER_00]: just not the way the unit was designed to
be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were using it incorrectly I
would let you know you are a pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate that always for sure So
that was Cavello and I'm gonna hit that as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know yesterday I heard you telling
people about You know kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology you guys were using to create
these terpenes versus You know how some
[SPEAKER_01]: other people create terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not all people are using You know the
same technology well right off the bat for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, you know not it's it's a pretty you
have to have a Commitment in your
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure and Tony absolutely has
commitment in his procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's developed it himself you know over
the last year and a half to two years and
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gotten to the point where I can tell
from just hitting the different terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and smelling them I've only really tasted
a few out there where I was like this
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it's whatever he's doing is he's
Doing it right and a lot of them have just
[SPEAKER_00]: like off color off taste little things
that when you first smell with your nose
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you learn to decipher the difference
between a real gassy sort of like whoo To
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's not supposed to be there
to something that's not was not on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant when you smelled it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so this can be terpenes that
are exchanging and changing into new
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes based on heat So depending on how
much of that steam is being in contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with the actual resin So there are tricks
to inverting and there are tricks to using
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacuums and there are tricks to using
chambers that cool things down Tony's
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously come up with an incredible IP
and his terpenes, you know And I say his
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes because I I don't make the
terpenes I do represent Blue River here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada But really the making of the
terpenes is Tony and he's he's he's nailed
[SPEAKER_00]: it He's done a great job and that's not to
say that someone else isn't gonna nail it
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow but at this point in time I Don't
promote Blue River because I sell them I
[SPEAKER_00]: sell Blue River because I promote them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know I get it because When I
became familiar with terpenes was with
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue River sure so unbeknownst to me I was
experiencing it at the highest level then
[SPEAKER_01]: as The idea became more pervasive and more
and more people were doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to You know see other people's Terp
representation or whatever they wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: call it and it was different So when I
heard you explaining it to someone else,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh That's why it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well and people are calling everything
terpenes We should be specific when we
[SPEAKER_00]: call these terpenes that they're cannabis
derived terpenes that they're they were
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios derived from cannabis ratios
They're they're accurate ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not mixes that we created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not purchasing food grade terpenes
and then making mixtures in them and that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something that worries me because
Cannabis has been producing Terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles for us to inhale safely for
thousands of years, but we Don't generally
[SPEAKER_00]: inhale pure terpenes extracted from lemons
or pure turkeys extracted from mangoes or
[SPEAKER_01]: any of those things so It is really
interesting that the terpene science You
[SPEAKER_01]: know where it's derived from and what
ratios and it's really amazing that your
[SPEAKER_01]: body, you know has these such pronounced
Effects from you know, these different
[SPEAKER_01]: smells that really makes you think about
you know what you what you eat as well and
[SPEAKER_01]: how all these things synergistically work
together Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about that in
Hashchurch lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Natasha Rice has been coming in and
sharing some beautiful information with us
[SPEAKER_00]: in regards to how to activate the
endocannabinoid system something you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have a great interest in of course through
exercise and through activity There are
[SPEAKER_00]: different diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different activities and diets
that we can use to actually activate our
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system and these things
Will have a great greater return as to say
[SPEAKER_00]: for the experience that you have from that
Amount in that particular time meaning
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just a runner's high that you're
getting when you're exercising and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using cannabis You can actually somehow
get that cannabis Seemingly communicating
[SPEAKER_00]: all over your body and really feel the
effects much more intensely once once
[SPEAKER_00]: you're active and it's why for me I've
never been an inactive cannabis user I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not really a couch and video game kind of
guy not saying that that's a bad thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do your enjoyment and relax
relaxation, but I see some people getting
[SPEAKER_00]: sucked into that and I think it would be
great for them to get out and go hiking
[SPEAKER_00]: get your blood moving get Oxygenated and
it's it to me for nothing else just to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to enjoy Your cannabis vibe on a
whole other level and then obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that's Livity the importance of
that is incredible and it's just one more
[SPEAKER_00]: thing cannabis is trying to tell you Yeah,
you know for me that man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for saying that I mean I
obviously an active cannabis user as well
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not obvious, but that's what we try
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obvious And you know this device is
kind of like the first step of you know
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we deliver the cannabinoids in like
the safest healthiest way?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know let's be honest like cannabis
is also like an enjoyable thing So how do
[SPEAKER_01]: we make it fun for the user to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know I really loved dabbing,
but there were a few things that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: especially I'm 39 I have you know friends
that are in their late 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean sorry Late 20s in their late 40s
and for them like the torch and nail was
[SPEAKER_01]: just something visually that was hard for
them to get over There's no denying that
[SPEAKER_00]: the torch and nail is is hard to get over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hardcore It is just is and way before
dabbing occurred like in the 90s before it
[SPEAKER_00]: was named and I'm sure there's people that
are watching this laughing We were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the 70s of course you were you
were taking oil and putting it on a hot
[SPEAKER_00]: metal substance And inhaling it of course
that's been around for 40 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not denying maybe thousands maybe
Thousands you know off the coal because I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember traveling in Guatemala exactly
nothing else But some oil and being like
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping a drop on a coal that was just
burning red hot and clean And it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dabbing in Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 1998 But yeah back then we would hit
the mayor this crazy contraption that my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends made and yeah, it was definitely
Some next-level shit we'd bring that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: to a party and it was a blowtorch that had
a spoon bent over top of the torch And
[SPEAKER_00]: they would heat up the spoon and then
there was a glass bell that went up into a
[SPEAKER_00]: bone It was super ghetto and really
hardcore and it scared people Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you showed up at a party and and not
people in their late 40s young people were
[SPEAKER_00]: freaked out by it They were like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't pass the mom test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just did not pass the mom test so it's
kind of a neat thing that you've done here
[SPEAKER_00]: because You know did did this ever exist
before you came up with this concept of
[SPEAKER_00]: like sliding the I've never seen it before
you know it's one of those things where It
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually designed for flowers and As
we were designing this device concentrates
[SPEAKER_01]: became very popular so During the R&D
process We wanted to make it a hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: device, but we also didn't want it to be
like really good at flower and just
[SPEAKER_01]: average at concentrate so Luckily the
design that we came up with for flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to be transferred over to the oil
side and apply you know not all but most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the technology you know we were able to
create advice that I think is is really
[SPEAKER_01]: good at both and Ultimately I think for
especially a lot of Cannabis users that
[SPEAKER_01]: are athletes or are very active Being able
to get the cannabinoids without any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fats waxes lipids or plant matter you know
it is more congruent with that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: diet and You know I believe a lot It
allows you to be a much more active
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis user as well awesome I'm just
like getting the dab here and thinking of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the haters on YouTube going bubble man
didn't dip He didn't clean his dabber,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was dipping it into different
terpenes I'll have you know that I'm only
[SPEAKER_00]: dipping the tip of the hash into the
terpenes and not the Titanium portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: the dabber it's crazy when you start
editing and doing so many of these videos
[SPEAKER_00]: that you become so aware of the things
that you're just trying to spit you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to Share these great messages that
you feel are important And it's just you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I said it the other day when I
was taught we were talking to Jeremiah and
[SPEAKER_00]: Jody I said you know We don't really get
to create reality exactly how we want it
[SPEAKER_00]: we get to we get to manifest But often it
does not manifest the way you think it
[SPEAKER_00]: will for instance He just said this thing
was designed for flowers and to me it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% concentration unit to me I'm not
saying you can't use flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put them in the basket, and it's
great But I just would rather concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: the resin off the flowers and use that to
me that makes so much more sense And it's
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you can't we fight for things and we
fought for cannabis to be you know allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: and and more normalized here in Canada and
To me we've won quite a bit down in
[SPEAKER_00]: California you guys have won quite a bit
is it perfect no are people going to jail
[SPEAKER_00]: still and being arrested yes, but the fact
that we have these places that we can go
[SPEAKER_00]: and buy cannabis and concentrates and that
These machines exist that you can inhale
[SPEAKER_00]: them with damn near perfect through
perfection is a is a pretty big win And I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that we should start Congratulating
ourselves a little bit and sort of maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even throwing a little celebration and
saying hey We got we got some substantial
[SPEAKER_01]: shit done in the last 25 years You know I
mean there's still more work to be done,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I feel like you I mean We have made so
much progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I'm wearing this shirt today power
plant fitness You know this is the gym
[SPEAKER_01]: that Ricky Williams And Jim McAlpine are
part of that is going to open in the San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco Bay area that Allows you to
consume Cannabis before you work out and
[SPEAKER_01]: the machine that you will be consuming
cannabis with will be these nice vape
[SPEAKER_00]: excel evos That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean you know just I mean even a
year ago this idea if I spoke about it to
[SPEAKER_01]: people I think they would just kind of
scoff and say it was a You know a pipe
[SPEAKER_01]: dream no pun intended, but do now the
wheels are in motion so many years since
[SPEAKER_00]: doing backcountry photography and like
2010 and 2011 and Being in the backcountry
[SPEAKER_00]: with skiers and snowboarders that were
just super Inspirational and that I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: were using cannabis as their inspiration
more so than anything else But because of
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsorships and whatnot there the lack of
normalization It was like it had to be
[SPEAKER_00]: hidden and it's it's it takes a lot for
these football players to come out and
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you because there are
Multi-million dollar careers at stake and
[SPEAKER_00]: when you see someone like Ricky Williams
choose to promote cannabis over his
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-million dollar career It's really
hard to argue with the integrity of such a
[SPEAKER_00]: cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean you know Okay, so what could
his agenda possibly be if he gave up
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of dollars to do this right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think his agenda is to educate and
help I mean Even more recently Eugene
[SPEAKER_01]: Monroe who's been very vocal about this I
mean he was an active player and he was
[SPEAKER_01]: you know telling the league to look at CBD
and cannabinoids as a way to help the
[SPEAKER_01]: players recover from these intense
Exercises and you know I told him the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time I met him like to me he had so
much to lose That you know just having him
[SPEAKER_01]: come out like he had all the respect in
the world for me because of what he had on
[SPEAKER_01]: You know on the line for saying what he
was saying and you know, I think he
[SPEAKER_01]: brought a lot of attention to not just
Cannot cannabis but CBD In particular and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm having people from all walks
of life asked me about it that I never
[SPEAKER_01]: would have imagined You know would even
consider cannabis as a way for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: heal and It's cool to be part of you know,
just a small part of this movement No,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really is man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's coming a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it's speeding up You know
if you ever read I think it was art Bell
[SPEAKER_00]: that wrote a book called the quickening
and it was it was crazy David Ike actually
[SPEAKER_00]: but showed a beautiful metaphor of how the
way we share information is Exponentially
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and the metaphor that he used was
a giant dinner plate and he takes a dinner
[SPEAKER_00]: plate and he Wobbles it on a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's doing this sort of thing and it's
going well whoo Well, whoo, well whoo and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like, okay that was like a thousand
years ago and then it starts going And
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like that was like a couple hundred
years ago and then it starts going And
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like that's now and then right before
it stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like And then it stops which is
also gets into Terrence McKenna's time
[SPEAKER_00]: wave zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty interesting stuff To look into
there's definitely the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: information that is passing every day
every hour Is like more than what passed a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred years ago in maybe a week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's a concentration that can
only every system reaches Q in engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: right Q is like the maximum that any
system can can take right or it basically
[SPEAKER_00]: either stops or disintegrates so it's an
interesting time that we're living in of
[SPEAKER_00]: massive amounts of incredible energy and
people like Eugene Monroe and yourself and
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricky and all these great people that are
just They're standing up tonight to
[SPEAKER_00]: normalize cannabis use in everyday life in
professional sports in You know palliative
[SPEAKER_00]: and homeopathic care Cannabinoid a little
pathic whatever that word that less than
[SPEAKER_00]: one spoon came up with Cannabin Cannaba
Pathic they're so hard to say it's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish they didn't train wreck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize Lester, but yeah, I think I'm
gonna hit this beautiful rip that I smell
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I feel when I try to pronounce
certain terpenes I read about them all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time and then when I have a conversation
with someone and I actually have to Say
[SPEAKER_01]: the name of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always comes out like Really jumbled
and disjointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it couldn't be anything worse than
what I just did to be cannabinopathic Word
[SPEAKER_01]: so What what was that last terpene that we
just experienced push cleaner?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes and Was that still the hash plant
rosin or a different rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was a different rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that was the sweet skunk and the
reason I put the sweet skunk in there is
[SPEAKER_00]: because that cleaner from the Jack is
really sort of sativa II and exotic and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course the sweet skunk has Sweet skunk is
not skunk at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's some there's some nice
cultivar in there, but it is not skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Assumed it was skunk because of its
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just Steve told me that Mark had run
out of all his skunk seeds on the menu and
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was like we need something skunk and
he was like I got these and I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember what the name was But he was just
like he mark just named them sweet skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is incredible might have annoyed me
back then I probably would have been like
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't do that But after so many years
of it being a favorite cultivar that the
[SPEAKER_00]: name is is a part of it to me and it's I
kind of yeah, I just went with it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: well the name is just to describe
something so exactly and chimera mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: it in hash church one day hopefully we'll
be able to the names of these cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: will be You know below that will be what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the cannabinoid profiles and what
are the terpenes and the turpenoids
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's That's what it actually is,
you know orange creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, what it's orange II and creamsicle
II Actually, it is we should probably hit
[SPEAKER_00]: that one next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, isn't that aren't people doing that
already today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they are starting to you know,
come up with you know, the the profile Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah slowly but surely but I mean like the
full profile, you know Like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a potential hundred and fifty
terpenes that we could be testing for and
[SPEAKER_00]: most places test for I mean most Cannabis
cultivars nowadays only have the same 10
[SPEAKER_00]: to 12, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot to do with prohibition
based growing where you grow for the
[SPEAKER_00]: greedy purpose of how much can you get and
How fast can you get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you were to train only a
specific way you would learn quickly that
[SPEAKER_00]: the blind spots that you left Behind what
would be would be vast, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they they got rid of all that A lot of
profiles by cutting down flowering periods
[SPEAKER_00]: people that would only grow six weeks
seven week strains Well, that means all
[SPEAKER_00]: the 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 week strains are all going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more rare because no one's taking the time
to produce them and those cultivars Grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in different countries produced different
cannabinoids that we also don't see in
[SPEAKER_00]: everyday strains We don't see THC V and we
don't see a lot of CBG or CBC and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids Quite a few of them that we
don't see because and I this is my theory
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis Prohibition based growing
sort of you know, cut a lot of that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fortunate really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it makes sense I mean people were
just growing high THC strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah It's fascinating reading all
the research on the various cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and how they help the body I had a chance
to sit down with one of the chief
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists from Steep Hill and He was
explaining how CBG has been helping his
[SPEAKER_01]: father recover from a stroke and His
father is an oncologist and a few years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago or maybe two years ago suffered a
stroke where He was essentially From the
[SPEAKER_01]: neck down, you know paralyzed and for six
months they went through all the standard
[SPEAKER_01]: therapies and medications that one would
go through when they suffered in the
[SPEAKER_01]: stroke and then not too much progress and
as you can imagine Was getting desperate
[SPEAKER_01]: so they started administering CBG Well,
I'll finish this that's a good rip I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never seen it push out of the tube like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seen it come out just gently from here
before but She was climbing all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was orange creamsicle with
Congolese Rosin so that's gonna be yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna be a wow fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was assuming it would be
right there And please do finish that
[SPEAKER_00]: story because I certainly didn't mean to
cut you off I just Well just to get cut to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point after six months he was able to
Go back to practicing medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they have been documenting
this and You know, hopefully in time we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to to share this story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but to me you know when people are
talking about whether this is a Medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: or just you know something that people
like to you know recreate with you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like it's such a silly argument
because If you believe in any other
[SPEAKER_01]: science Yeah, that's what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let us have it please all of us
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that Congolese dreamsicle was
my favorite thus far it had the most like
[SPEAKER_01]: complexity and depth to the flavor I don't
think I could even articulate the flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: except that it was Very very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a nuttiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I always get oh It was
almost coconut II.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost and but like creamy coconut
II Like almost like suntan lotion,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not like a or a piña colada Not bad
like not the way you would expect like I
[SPEAKER_00]: hate this taste of piña colada,
but that was amazing Jesus I Think that
[SPEAKER_01]: Congolese rosin is a really good base to
be dipping into the because we had the
[SPEAKER_01]: Congolese with the cleaner yesterday and
That one had me Goosebumps for a good five
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes This is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Just want to see this available to more
people, you know, like I just think that
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be a cool thing People to have
access to great Tasting, you know having
[SPEAKER_00]: the conversation with Jeremiah and Jody
Emory the other day Where where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, like what's the most
important relationship that you have with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than the way it makes you feel the
smell, of course, of course It absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the flavor profile and the taste and
the smell and that's You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what the Tony's done with these
blue river terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just pulled them out in the most
beautiful of manners and I'm happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: share it with people I'm happy to share it
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very stoked that you came up with the
vape exhale and I look forward to some
[SPEAKER_00]: potential future collaborations at the
bubble man and the vape exhale team you
[SPEAKER_00]: built an incredible team and I'm
definitely Excited to see where the future
[SPEAKER_00]: leads vape exhale and Sabo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I believe this this and this It at
this point that is like the tippity top of
[SPEAKER_01]: how you could experience cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely You can't fake the goosebumps
that I get, you know, it's no sales pitch
[SPEAKER_00]: here I mean That's what I'm saying and
I've even made a point on and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you've probably done it with your unit as
well Where you're just like for the Terps?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought I have to step back for
like a week or two and just like cuz I got
[SPEAKER_00]: so deep in I was like, I just love these
things people like type type people that
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly had never done it every single
person I've ever given a dab to has been
[SPEAKER_00]: like, wow, that's what they always say and
so I just felt like I needed to pull back
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that there was no hype or
anything confusing me or any sort of and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have Terps for probably more than a
week actually and getting this these seven
[SPEAKER_00]: vials was just like Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like your favorite sauce on your
favorite meal pizza without sauce is no
[SPEAKER_01]: bueno Well when I was little I used to
really like reading those books where you
[SPEAKER_01]: could you know choose You know pay the
option a or option B me too Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like page 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: If if you want to jump off the cliff,
I was gonna say look over the cliff So I
[SPEAKER_01]: believe you know these terpenes especially
with that first one the the Kush or the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes You know, I felt like because that was
more of like a blank palette It really
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of took on the flavor of exactly how
that smelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whereas when we had the Congolese as
the base Especially with something so
[SPEAKER_00]: different like orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just The synergies of it was
undeniable is next level next level I
[SPEAKER_00]: usually hit the Kush cleaner with the
Congo because of that cleaner and that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of sativa flavor or sweet skunk But I
thought you know what he wants orange
[SPEAKER_00]: creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our last rip and we haven't hit the
Congo yet you also notice the vibe from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Congo is it's That's one that I would
be working out with you will people will
[SPEAKER_00]: learn at the Gym that there are cultivars
that are congruent to getting them to
[SPEAKER_01]: working out Yeah, so down in California
one strain that seems to be very popular
[SPEAKER_01]: is the red Congolese I don't know how
similar it is to those someone right here,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, but um, I do We have this other
company cannot athlete that is making this
[SPEAKER_01]: recovery serum and whenever we can get Our
distillate made with this type of trim we
[SPEAKER_01]: believe It is congruent with the feelings
that you would need to perform at a high
[SPEAKER_01]: level after you consume cannabis where you
get like the focus with the relaxation,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, you know more closer to flow
state and Yeah, I mean, I think this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain like you said is really congruent
if you want to You know do some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: activity that requires like dexterity like
maybe wakeboarding or you know
[SPEAKER_01]: snowboarding so Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it'll be interesting to see where it
all goes in the next upcoming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely I'm in it for the long haul
this industry has had me for 20 plus years
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't see it letting go anytime
soon, so I'm gonna keep on enjoying
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible technology and learning as much
as I can about that technology and these
[SPEAKER_00]: processes and the growing and all of these
different things so I can share it with
[SPEAKER_00]: you the bubble man audience and I want to
