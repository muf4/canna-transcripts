[SPEAKER_13]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash Church 2.0 episode five.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sending out the link right now to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get everyone inside here.
[SPEAKER_13]: See what's going on today.
[SPEAKER_13]: How's everyone feeling?
[SPEAKER_13]: We're really excited today to talk about
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been a really wonderful thing for us
to be able to grow in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, it's been it's a beautiful
environment to be in.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really changed a lot of the way
that we grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it offers us, you know, different
environments in our in our world to be
[SPEAKER_13]: able to create beautiful spaces.
[SPEAKER_13]: So looks like we got Jonathan Valdman in
here from Forever Flowering.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how are you feeling?
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you feeling today?
[SPEAKER_13]: We got farmer Tom coming in the house
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning, Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Jonathan.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you too, homie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see you this morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: Eric.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, how are you feeling today?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're in the greenhouse there down in
California.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell us what's going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are you sitting?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at the office here at Forever
Flowering and Grass Valley.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just out here at the greenhouses
because the weather is so nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured I'd sit outside today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Morning, Jason.
[SPEAKER_11]: You hear me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Morning, Jason.
[SPEAKER_06]: Morning, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragonfly, you guys are muted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, so I was thinking, farmer Tom,
maybe you can give us a minute.
[SPEAKER_13]: And why don't you tell us a little bit
about your story?
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's going on in your world?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is farmer Tom, and I'm out of
Lowerman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm originally out of San Diego,
but I've been up here in Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington for the past 14 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a five acre farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought an old nursery, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it came with 500 foot greenhouses,
little Quonset hut styles, two wells,
[SPEAKER_01]: two inch main lines up and down the
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much everything I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been here ever since and kind
of doing our thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally from San Diego, it was part of
the 215 pushback in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our collective shelter from the storm in
Hillcrest in San Diego got raided in 99,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I got arrested with Steve McWilliams
for 448 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of kicked me into the
advocate zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the worst thing could happen to you,
and then you're not afraid anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been kind of pushing through over
the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of took a different route.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked a lot with the media back in
the day here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the early days of I-502,
and even back in the medical days when we
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing the farmers markets up here,
I just thought it was a push to a better
[SPEAKER_01]: way to play it by being more accessible to
them and then trying to do my best to
[SPEAKER_01]: represent cannabis as well as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of all led up to we did some
education over here over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with Washington State to
legalize concentrates because when they
[SPEAKER_01]: first came out with I-502, the legal
system up here, only concentrates were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be in medibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was asked by Como News out of
Seattle to do an open blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody thought I was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within two weeks, basically our
message was if you don't regulate it,
[SPEAKER_01]: then don't tax it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time here in Washington State,
it was like every 10 days to two weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were having another explosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going, if you don't regulate it and
tax it, these kids will blow themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a $20 to $100 fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to have a lot of problems
on your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within two weeks, they changed the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of led into me being able to ask
to work with the Department of Health and
[SPEAKER_01]: Human Services on a federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to educate seven agents from
the CDC on production and processing of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first got on the phone with 10
agents, they knew nothing about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were getting all their information
from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense to YouTube, but I kind of went,
wasn't it unfair to come in and do
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluation of our industry and not really
know what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they agreed to come to my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to take them on a tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't like that idea, but they made
my farm a secure location where federal
[SPEAKER_01]: agents can learn, touch and handle
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had them out here a total of five
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had them out here in August for a couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants were about six feet tall and we
were thinning them out at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I showed them all my practices that
I've been using as far as the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything else we were doing with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we gave them demos on hydrocarbons and
I brought in JD from Skunk Farm to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: tell them about concentrates and Dana from
Goat Labs to kind of give them the lab
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did hand trimming, machine
trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that was kind of the precursor to
when they came out for the actual health
[SPEAKER_01]: hazard evaluation in October of 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like the glory year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was like the best year ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was lucky that we didn't get earlier
rains and we didn't have any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: issues going at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had them out there for three days
and they were there to collect some
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific data for work place,
health and safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they hooked us up with snippers,
one that collected mold, one that collect
[SPEAKER_01]: dust particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had similar apparatuses
around the property in the greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the open air and in our trimming
and drying room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gathered all the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went back and it was published in
April of 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in August of 2017, I got my own web
page on the CDC.gov web page dedicated to
[SPEAKER_01]: the scientific study.
[SPEAKER_01]: OSHA is using them on a national level to
create workplace health and safety
[SPEAKER_01]: standards for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cal OSHA is using the same report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe Washington State's used it
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that the report's out, the latest
thing is that my farm is referred to as an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Search studies that are being done on the
federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what I've been up to the
last few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much, Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like you're leading the way in
so many ways for us to get out the good
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it really takes all of us and I'm
just doing my part.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our fourth semester teaching at
Clark Community College, the cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: your health course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done the agricultural part.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done cloning and seed popping and
then the mediums to use and taking your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to harvest for harvest highest
yields and harvesting and curing sections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're into our second year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited about it and just
doing my part.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think maybe we should go to Marcus down
in Jamaica for a minute if you have a
[SPEAKER_13]: minute to tell us what's going on down
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And how you're feeling, that would be
really great.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then Eric, you can jump on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you guys hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of a delay, but no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, Tom.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was wonderful to hear everything you
had to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know you and I like you
immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys all for showing up today to
do this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to Forever Flowering Greenhouse,
Eric and Jonathan for helping moderate and
[SPEAKER_04]: of course to the Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like Marcus may be coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Greenhouse Flower myself, but I am here
with him since last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he'll hopefully be able to add some
value to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just really, really stoked that
everyone showed up to share in this
[SPEAKER_04]: dialogue today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think like Tom was saying, you know,
YouTube's not always the best source for
[SPEAKER_04]: information, but we're trying to change
that every day with at least our little
[SPEAKER_04]: slice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's because of people like all the
people sitting on this panel that decide
[SPEAKER_04]: to come and share their time with us that
we're able to put this caliber of
[SPEAKER_04]: information out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do thank all of you greatly for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess maybe I'll have a little bong
rip while we go over to the next person.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds excellent.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got this really nice pipe from the
Snoggrass family last night, Bob
[SPEAKER_13]: Snoggrass.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we'll take a first.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to hit the gondola pipe.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Eric, and let's nice to have you
here this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a little bit about what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you guys are here with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just, you know, I'm here at the
office today.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have good wives.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear better than at my house.
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured I'd come here and it's a little
bit better background.
[SPEAKER_07]: The weather is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost like spring light depth
weather.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy here in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, the people that we have on are
some, I think, in my opinion, some pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: cool people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm excited to hear and talk with them
and let the rest of the community get to
[SPEAKER_07]: know them as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of wanted to start off and try
to do some brief introductions real quick
[SPEAKER_07]: so maybe everybody can hear who is who and
that way they can, and that way everybody
[SPEAKER_07]: gets a chance to say hello.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Tom, I think your microphone's on
still.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the top is the mute button.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, basically, why don't we just do a
quick introduction for everybody and we'll
[SPEAKER_07]: start it with Micah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you tell us who you are and your
company and then we'll get back to you for
[SPEAKER_07]: some conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the first time on Google Hangouts.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to make sure I'm doing it right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So my name is Micah Anderson and I own a
company called Leaf Organics in California
[SPEAKER_09]: and operate and own a few different farms
in Humboldt and Mendocino County and then
[SPEAKER_09]: have a couple of projects in Southern
California and Riverside.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are basically a brand that you
would find in any of the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: We make all kinds of different products
and one of the main focuses that we are
[SPEAKER_09]: doing right now is on CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we grow all of our own CBD genetics and
turn them into all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_09]: products like top coal soaps and all that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I'm stoked to be here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in Colorado right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Took three days off and tried to go
snowboarding but there's not very much
[SPEAKER_09]: snow over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's similar to California right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm stoked to be on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate it and I'm happy to
hear what you guys have to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on Micah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thanks for coming and I'm glad you
joined us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonathan, why don't you give us a quick
little who you are real fast.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I just want to get a big
shout out to the bubble man down there in
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, my brother?
[SPEAKER_11]: So glad to be here with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been using your bag since I lived in
Arcata in 2000.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I was talking with my lady
this morning and we were just talking
[SPEAKER_11]: about how like that just changed the game
right there, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it really made hash making
accessible to the people and really
[SPEAKER_11]: started the whole solventless movement,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_11]: So big ups, brother.
[SPEAKER_11]: And big ups on your light depth hat.
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Jonathan founded Forever
Flowering in 2006.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been working with Eric since 2007.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've really been working hard around the
clock year round to in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_11]: educate people as to why you wanted to
block the light out of greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_11]: People would always laugh at us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, why are you trying to block the
light out of greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, you know, for the first many
years, it was a lot of a lot of education.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we see the industry moving forward,
and we're seeing the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_11]: licenses going, especially in states
outside of California, going towards
[SPEAKER_11]: indoor cultivation, we're really seeing
this massive carbon footprint that's being
[SPEAKER_11]: created.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can see the headlines in so many
places that they're saying cannabis is
[SPEAKER_11]: this massive energy consuming industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really not necessary.
[SPEAKER_11]: True, it is today, but it's totally not
necessary.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so when you can't afford it,
you can really dial in a greenhouse to
[SPEAKER_11]: give you to give you the somebody's on
mute.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hemp guy who came on has to mute that
person has to mute.
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, when you design a greenhouse
with the proper environment, you're able
[SPEAKER_11]: to get, you know, top quality flowers and
and still have the efficiency of growing
[SPEAKER_11]: sun grown.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we're seeing in most regulated
states, full sun grown is really all going
[SPEAKER_11]: to extracts, they're really oil fields at
this point.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what we're really seeing in the
dispensaries are indoor or high grade,
[SPEAKER_11]: light depth, or greenhouse grown.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and unfortunately, that's that's my
intro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I ramble off too much just had a
cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_11]: So much love to you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get me started.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, you're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the direction we're headed for
sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: intros.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason, you want to say hi and tell us who
you are, where you're at real quick.
[SPEAKER_13]: You might have to go closer to your
computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't hear you, Jason.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little better, but you might want
to get some earbuds if you have some for
[SPEAKER_07]: your from your phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab some and I'll jump to JD real quick
and then we'll come back to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: JD, why don't you give us a quick intro
and say what you're all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: unmute yourself, unmute yourself.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, this is great.
[SPEAKER_12]: I I'm right here in grass valley.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're on gold country cannabis with my
team here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been doing lots of greenhouse
growing the last few years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had a lot of success just bringing
it to the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put this at the front of the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: JD, you're gonna have to hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who the Hey, Hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if dragonfly can mute him or
not.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hemp fam.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hemp family.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, what you smoking on?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Jake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it another try.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unmute, unmute.
[SPEAKER_12]: I should be unmuted.
No.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go country Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is my brand.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've just been out here growing for
probably like the last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: I worked my way from Sonoma County up in
Domingo Humboldt Lake County and found my
[SPEAKER_12]: way to grass valley and Sierra foothills.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a great climate for greenhouse
growing.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had a lot of success and have a
strong team just love love it industry and
[SPEAKER_12]: everything about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's really exciting to be included
here with you guys and can't wait to see
[SPEAKER_12]: where this conversation goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome JD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I can't wait to talk to you,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hemp person bounce so we can just move
along.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got farmer Tom.
[SPEAKER_07]: We already had bubble man and Dem check
in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so let's talk some greenhouses a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Micah has got to kind of maybe
leave early.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was going to maybe start with Micah
bubble man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got something you want to say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was just going to say there's skunk
man's here as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys want to hear a quick intro
from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people know a lot about
him, but it might be a neat thing to hear
[SPEAKER_04]: a couple of words from from the man
himself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here he is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Howdy, howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in Hatch Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my experience with greenhouses was I
built my own greenhouse about 40 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, and then I moved to the Netherlands
where I ran many, many, many professional
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses with computerized darkening,
computerized watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my favorite way to grow is
greenhouses, although there's.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen most of the changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were one of the very first in the world
to use darkening for to mature cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers in the when we were in the
northern environment in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody has any questions,
I'll be happy to step up to the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: But except for that, I am what I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think pretty much everybody knows
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your story right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ahead, Eric.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, basically, you know,
we're here to talk about greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody on the panel here is using
greenhouses in some capacity, whether
[SPEAKER_07]: it's, you know, whether they're working
with us or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's got a unique story to
themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, Mike, I was just going to kick it
off with you since in case you have to
[SPEAKER_07]: bounce early, at least we can get some of
the information from Leaf Organics.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm a big fan of your products
as well, just because everything you have
[SPEAKER_07]: is so cool and sun grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I use the pet CBDs, you know,
for my old dogs and even the CBD shampoo.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, not going into the
products as much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just curious for your story as,
you know, a grower in Southern and
[SPEAKER_07]: Northern California, how have the
greenhouses or what, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: what achievements or breakthroughs have
you had in the greenhouse sector in the
[SPEAKER_07]: last couple of years?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think for me that where the,
you know, greenhouses come into play and
[SPEAKER_09]: especially like deprivation greenhouses
come into play in this like new era of
[SPEAKER_09]: regulation and taxes and having to like
really focus on your cost of goods,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's where I see, you know, not only do
I think plants grow better in greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_09]: but for us, it's a way for us to get our
cost of goods down.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're able to, you know, constantly be
harvesting over and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_09]: versus just getting one big harvest a
year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, and then we're,
you know, seeing a big difference between
[SPEAKER_09]: what we're getting in output in Southern
California versus Northern California just
[SPEAKER_09]: due to weather.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, most of the places in
Humboldt, Mendocino, we're all off the
[SPEAKER_09]: grid and there's no power, nothing like
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's all ran off solar systems,
which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, or we're pulling tarps, you know,
which is still totally good and works.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think if that, I don't know if that
answers your question or not, but for us,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a way for us to constantly be
getting fresh product in the rotation and
[SPEAKER_09]: not be sitting on just a bunch of,
you know, older inventory and helps us get
[SPEAKER_09]: our cost of goods down, which is super
important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, that's the name of the game
these days, keeping the cost of goods
[SPEAKER_07]: down, because there's so many things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, now with regulation, state taxes
have kicked in.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure, you know, medical legal for a
while now, the state taxes have kicked in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's got to be a little bit of a
new, I guess, new challenge for you to
[SPEAKER_07]: address.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every day, we always talk about it at the
office.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a Rubik's cube, you know,
trying to figure out what changes you're
[SPEAKER_09]: going to have to deal with next.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the laws aren't even really set yet,
and they're going to change again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so how do you feel about, I mean,
you guys run fairly moderate sized
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys working on any big projects
or anything coming up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys going to stay kind of the,
you know, mid-sized greenhouses that
[SPEAKER_07]: you've been using now and pulling tarps?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or where's the future ahead now with
trying to keep cost of production down and
[SPEAKER_07]: state taxes kicking in?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think for now, we have a bit of both.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as you know, we have some
forever flowering greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_09]: and then we have some that we're pulling
tarps on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of that comes down to what city
or county you're in and has a lot to do
[SPEAKER_09]: with what your local taxes are.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do have a bigger project that we're
working on in Riverside County,
[SPEAKER_09]: which we're going to be doing a bunch of.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be a bigger project and it'll be,
you know, a fully automated greenhouse
[SPEAKER_09]: setup.
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally like the idea of keeping
greenhouses in a smaller environment
[SPEAKER_09]: versus like this massive Costco style
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a lot easier to mitigate
problems with all kinds of stuff,
[SPEAKER_09]: pests, and not that you don't need these
massive HVAC systems and sort of turn the
[SPEAKER_09]: thing into a gigantic indoor room,
which I see a lot of people doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yeah, I mean, I think in the
future, we're definitely leaning towards
[SPEAKER_09]: building a couple of these bigger
facilities, but there's still something to
[SPEAKER_09]: be said about quality product being grown
in a small environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's anytime we've ever scaled,
you know, like we did in the last couple
[SPEAKER_09]: of years, it's hard to keep up and make
sure that you're putting out the same
[SPEAKER_09]: quality product every single time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a bit of both.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's key.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always a tough thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And about consistency, you know,
a lot of the flower these days,
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, in California and some places
would end up going to distillates and oils
[SPEAKER_07]: and extracts, which is a good thing in
some ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm kind of wondering if we're going
to see flowers, you know, on the shelves,
[SPEAKER_07]: top shelf flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: People want to buy some flowers to go
camping with, to roll a joint or do
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know that there's a lot of mids
going down, but, you know, is California
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be hit with a shortage kind of
like Nevada was just in the top shelf
[SPEAKER_07]: flower category?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think all the other things are
going to fall into place.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just worry about that good doobie
material.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was reading about somebody the other
day saying something about everybody's
[SPEAKER_07]: just going to get used to mids and not
really remember what top shelf looks like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, whoa, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know that you guys are doing good in
the top shelf category.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the grow sisters just joined us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Siobhan, why don't you say hello?
[SPEAKER_07]: We all did an introduction before you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got stoned and lost my way on the
internet, so sorry I'm late.
[SPEAKER_14]: I am Siobhan Danger-Darwish, and I own and
operate California's first permitted
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis location, West Coast Farms.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I am also one of the five grow
sisters.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Micah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We party in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_14]: What?
[SPEAKER_14]: MJBizCon.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so I guess, am I telling you more?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it still my stage, or am I just
introducing myself?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, I mean, the introduction is the
different lessons.
[SPEAKER_07]: And is that your brand?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're muted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I had to mute her because you were
echoing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, we're back.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, those are my brands.
[SPEAKER_14]: The farm itself is West Coast Farms.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Grow Sisters media production is a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're a little bit more of the education
side.
[SPEAKER_14]: And initially, it started because my
sister, my actual sister, Sloan Reed,
[SPEAKER_14]: and I wanted to, we didn't have money to
market our farm.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we decided to set a guerrilla
marketing style of instructional videos.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, they kind of took off.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so this year, it's our second year
doing the Grow Sisters.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've adopted five new sisters,
four new sisters, and some
[SPEAKER_14]: behind-the-scenes sisters.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we're really able to branch out
from the farm and cultivate cannabis in
[SPEAKER_14]: all its new facets.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I echoing you again?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I echoey?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, anyone that doesn't have their mic
muted will echo through someone else's
[SPEAKER_04]: camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just try to mute when you don't talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And get ready to unmute when you want to
talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And welcome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I met you at the Golden Tarp Awards.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where you were a host for the
live stream.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that was a pretty cool event,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys did a really good job of
hosting and live streaming that whole
[SPEAKER_07]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's it like to be the first
permitted farm in Humboldt County,
[SPEAKER_07]: by the way?
[SPEAKER_14]: Stressful.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were the guinea pigs.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it felt like our heads were on the
chopping block, to be completely honest.
[SPEAKER_14]: But on the flip side of that, it's been
amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been wonderful.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, what a blessing, too.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a second-generation farmer.
[SPEAKER_14]: And to be able to carry the torch for my
father, who lived in the hills for years
[SPEAKER_14]: and years and years, you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: And here I am with the first permitted
farm.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an honor.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a blessing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hence, blessed coast.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, it's been crazy.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've gotten some really beautiful
recognition for our farming techniques due
[SPEAKER_14]: to being the first.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we like to tell people that we filled
out the application as simply as possible.
[SPEAKER_14]: Simple farming methods, simply organic.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's why we think we got it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got lucky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate you coming on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll talk a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_07]: JD, are you still over there?
[SPEAKER_07]: I see JD was walking around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: JD lives in Grass Valley.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even really know JD.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in Grass Valley, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I happen to see him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our kids go to the same school.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I was at an event.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw he won an award last year and
even this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this guy's winning all these cups.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm dropping my kids off at
school.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there he is in the parking lot,
walking his kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like this, whoa, like right on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted to meet him over the course of
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we started linking up slowly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I thought JD has a good story or
interesting background with the ability to
[SPEAKER_07]: enter these events and win them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm curious on the style of growing
you're using.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you a high tech grower?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it low tech?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the secret to some of your success
without giving everything away?
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We all love it so much.
[SPEAKER_12]: Our team works really hard.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we put in a little too much work
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_12]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: We could probably not be as perfection
driven.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we take really good care of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's compost tea.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's organic top dressings.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like the plant really reflects what
you're putting into it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if everybody is in a clear space and
working together, then it seems like the
[SPEAKER_12]: round will really show that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had some really high terpene levels.
[SPEAKER_12]: The last couple of rounds.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it was because the industry is
changing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was stressed out.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the plant was stressed out.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those terpenes are its natural defense
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like as the plant gets more stressed,
it seems like it pushes out more medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, moving up the coast was
great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Growing in Lake County was great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving into the Sierra Fiddle was
absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Losing the coastal influence and really
having these hot days seems to really
[SPEAKER_12]: trigger the plants into swelling up at the
right time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And just appreciating where we're given to
them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've grown everything from low end
carports, Costco car canopies with grow
[SPEAKER_12]: weave all the way to 2,500 square foot
auto depths that are completely dialed in.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've won awards from both directions.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's like I haven't really been able to
nail it down exactly what works.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just seems to be working.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's working across the board.
[SPEAKER_12]: And probably due to the level of love that
my team puts in and this climate that we
[SPEAKER_12]: have.
[SPEAKER_07]: How long have you lived in the Grass
Valley?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you said you started out maybe the
coast, Lake County.
[SPEAKER_07]: How long have you been over here now to
the foothills?
[SPEAKER_12]: See, I was in Lake County in 2001.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I made it here probably about
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: Smartsville, Browns Valley, or San Juan.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been kind of all over the place.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but the last five years I've really
been able to dial it in and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is where my family wanted to land.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was about as close to the snow as I
could be.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the rest of them don't like the
cold.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it ended up being a great mix.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's like close to Tahoe in the winter,
below the snow line, the rest of the
[SPEAKER_12]: season.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it just really makes our job easy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So everything that we put in here seems to
just go so much farther.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's almost like you could start
pulling tarps today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this weather has been unreal.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yesterday in Browns Valley it was 81
degrees.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's like at night we're still
like in the low 50s.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's some good growing weather.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you use a passive style greenhouse or a
sealed greenhouse with mechanical
[SPEAKER_07]: ventilation?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your style of greenhouse operation?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like the canopies, the ones we build
ourselves, they're open all the way
[SPEAKER_12]: around.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have about a knee high, you know,
knee high to the ground.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just wide open all the way around the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have one end of the canopy would be
sealed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, not sealed, but pulled down
probably about three quarters of the way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other end wide open.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that kind of creates like a funnel and
it like forces air from the sides and the
[SPEAKER_12]: back and flushes it out that open end of
the hoop automatically without using fans
[SPEAKER_12]: or anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: My auto depth is definitely like,
you know, closed up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how sealed it is,
but it's definitely closed up and with
[SPEAKER_12]: thermostats and can flush that air out
really fast when it hits the right
[SPEAKER_12]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, do you, when you enter a ward,
so you enter them out of any greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_07]: it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know, you don't have one
greenhouse that's better for the award
[SPEAKER_07]: maker than the other or turf maker,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unmute.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I was trying to figure out like
exactly what was the recipe.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the first one we won, we got a second
place hybrid at HempCon.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was where the Harley Sue CBD
strain going up against Indoor.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it ended up winning.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's just out of a Costco carport
with no fans, no supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it just did great.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like, kind of look around,
like, you know, you can tell the plant
[SPEAKER_12]: that really does it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can tell the round.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, when the round is just going off
and that was that one was really good.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Golden Tarp winners and Emel Cup
winners have been out of the auto death,
[SPEAKER_12]: probably at about, I think it's like an
800 foot elevation.
[SPEAKER_12]: That one's pushing really high turf
profiles.
[SPEAKER_12]: Almost everything that came out of there,
that round was like over 5% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: The plants were a little more stressed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't think it was going to be that
good of a round, but when it came to test
[SPEAKER_12]: results, they were just off the hook.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny how that goes sometimes,
you know, like stress and plants out and
[SPEAKER_07]: things like that can be stressful for the
grower as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then you end up, you know,
trimming it up and maybe even getting
[SPEAKER_07]: those lab results and voila, you got
something special.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always kind of hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Jason, are you back?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you able to jump on and introduce
yourself now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, we kind of glazed over for a
second.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you guys hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's.
[SPEAKER_08]: That worked.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my name is Jason.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am a recreational grower up here in
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_08]: Started in medical and long before that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say what got me into greenhouse
growing was just kind of watching the
[SPEAKER_08]: prices just ratchet down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And kind of really feeling like I needed
to look into a different growing method.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so kind of at the tail end of medical,
I started in with talking to Eric and
[SPEAKER_08]: getting together plans to build a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, as it kind of
progressed, getting licensed, really
[SPEAKER_08]: seeing everything just change drastically.
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of occurred to me that,
you know, we grew indoors to hide from the
[SPEAKER_08]: cops.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now in this, you know, regulated
market and legal market in Washington,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's like I just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why everybody isn't going this direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the future really is like that
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it really is going that direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, coming from an indoor
grower background for so many years,
[SPEAKER_08]: I really just took everything that I knew
from indoor growing and applied it in the
[SPEAKER_08]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think my quality is just as good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I mean, I think I'm growing at the
same levels.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, everything is just as good,
if not better in a lot of cases,
[SPEAKER_08]: not to mention a much more enjoyable work
environment being under the sun.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's it's chock full of gavitas
and fans and dehumidifiers because we have
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty wet weather up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I grow year round and I love growing
in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got I've got one of forever flowering
almost a thousand square foot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I've got a few hoop houses that I
run just as sort of old school polo type
[SPEAKER_08]: during the season.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so far so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to your place a couple of years ago
and you're up on the islands of
[SPEAKER_07]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the incredible things about
your particular property is that there's
[SPEAKER_07]: bald eagles flying everywhere around.
[SPEAKER_07]: The greenhouses and like, you know,
it's just this magical space.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, whether you're pulling tarps
or an automated greenhouse or whatever,
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't imagine that being a tough place
to live and grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I was mesmerized by the place
myself and look forward to coming back and
[SPEAKER_07]: visiting again sometime.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, how we met, too,
is that all your videos on Instagram was
[SPEAKER_07]: you going through a 50,000 square foot
indoor facility on a scale of eight board
[SPEAKER_07]: going from room to room to room.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and it was the build out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the build out of this big,
massive indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically you one day just walked away
and, you know, bought the 80,000 square
[SPEAKER_07]: foot greenhouse to kind of test this all
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I mean, I think you've
really become one of the bigger sun grown
[SPEAKER_07]: fanatics that I've seen out of the
industry just because your dramatic change
[SPEAKER_07]: from that huge build out to just literally
walking away.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and starting fresh.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's an awesome, awesome
situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was part of a tier three warehouse and
we looked for the right space and then we
[SPEAKER_08]: started building it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was kind of sort of looking at this
whole idea and kind of seeing the writing
[SPEAKER_08]: on the wall that this is not really
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I ended up leaving my percentage on
the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: Felling good luck and walking away.
[SPEAKER_08]: We ended up getting our own tier two
license and basically converted our
[SPEAKER_08]: medical facility into our 502 facility,
which just involved a lot of fence and
[SPEAKER_08]: cameras and all sorts of fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what we do with growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, when the funny thing is,
when I visited you, it was recreational in
[SPEAKER_07]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: It started, but you were still medical.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the medical people could still walk
around with their jars and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was kind of chill.
[SPEAKER_07]: But where you go into the tier twos and
the the regulated recreational,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's cameras and you can't do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it was definitely kind of a fun
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fun thing about Jason's greenhouse
was built over his indoor grow room that
[SPEAKER_07]: was underground.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an underground vault.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was kind of like the old ghost town
when you pulled open the door to look down
[SPEAKER_07]: in there at the old grow space that was,
you know, from the prohibition days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now there's this big greenhouse on top
of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's funny how times have changed or
how far we've all come from, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: people growing in prohibition times to
medical to recreational.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a whole evolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you definitely showcase that at your
place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we had a little 10 foot by 16 foot
shed that we that we built essentially
[SPEAKER_08]: over the top of a matching footprint.
[SPEAKER_08]: Underground.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was, you know, way back in the
day, that was that was my little spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Walking this nondescript little shed,
pull open the trap door, walk down the
[SPEAKER_08]: ladder.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, I didn't want to lose
that because it was such a cool little
[SPEAKER_08]: room.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we ended up building a greenhouse
right over the top of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the entire structure sits on a
basically a floating platform.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then and for a while, right before,
you know, needing to scale up the veg.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my little bedroom for the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: So classic.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all self-contained.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we're kind of converting that into
more of like a little storage room.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it's it's it's been an
interesting journey for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I held on with medical as long as I
possibly could right up until literally
[SPEAKER_08]: the last the last day, pulled down my last
harvest and then went right into medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right into recreational.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of sad to see the old days
go, but it's you know, it also comes with
[SPEAKER_08]: the helicopter insurance, I like to call
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So helicopter insurance for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, right on, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to jump over to Jonathan real
quick, because Jonathan, before you lose
[SPEAKER_07]: your coffee buzz, I want you to get back
on that role you had earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if you think about it,
all the people here, this topic,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like light deprivation in
general, I know it wasn't invented by
[SPEAKER_07]: Forever Flowering because a lot of people
online are like, you know, you didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: invent it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, you know, I mean, you really
brought a technique in a sense that you
[SPEAKER_07]: made it a company that people could access
all this gear and information to do light
[SPEAKER_07]: deprivation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so let's hear a little bit about,
you know, that story in your background
[SPEAKER_07]: and coming up and.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Eric.
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I just want to start out by
giving props to all the first gen people,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the second gen people,
all the people that really, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: laid this foundation and blazed the trail
for the rest of us to be doing what we do
[SPEAKER_11]: right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, a lot of people that come into
the game right now don't realize that
[SPEAKER_11]: people went to jail, you know,
people went to jail, people had their
[SPEAKER_11]: properties taken away, people had their
kids taken away from them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And and today we're just talking about
taxes and we're talking about how do we go
[SPEAKER_11]: about filling out applications?
[SPEAKER_11]: And regulations and such.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, you know, really big up to all
those people big up to Dennis Perrone that
[SPEAKER_11]: just passed recently and all the people
that really paved the way for Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's it's a different day and
age right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, you know, just really giving
thanks and having gratitude for all those
[SPEAKER_11]: people.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, thankfully, you know,
I've been in this in this industry for
[SPEAKER_11]: about 25 years and thankfully never had
any of those knocks on the door that so
[SPEAKER_11]: many people have woken up to in the middle
of the night.
[SPEAKER_11]: But but as far as greenhouses go,
before I get into that, I just want to
[SPEAKER_11]: point out one thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look behind me right here,
that's a ruby red grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's citrus growing at 2000 feet up in
the Sierras with no covering in February
[SPEAKER_11]: 3rd or 4th, wherever we are right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So even going beyond the whole idea of the
benefits of greenhouses and how they,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, increased hurt profiles,
how they're you know, really give that
[SPEAKER_11]: bling of that indoor look that so many
people are looking for.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can just stop at crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can just stop right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you're talking about a plant
that's not going to get dusted with sprays
[SPEAKER_11]: going on from your neighbor or dust coming
on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we're looking at all the
different microbial tests and you look at
[SPEAKER_11]: people, you know, Greenlife Productions
over in Nevada came down and gave us a
[SPEAKER_11]: little schooling on the fact that in their
tests in Nevada, just from the test
[SPEAKER_11]: results, you're able to tell if the
trimmer was wearing a face mask or not.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so when we're getting down to levels
like that, we're really starting to look
[SPEAKER_11]: at, you know, all these different nuances
that we really got to protect our crop
[SPEAKER_11]: from.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not to mention the fact that, you know,
it's 81 degrees in Browns Valley in the
[SPEAKER_11]: beginning of February.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's going to happen when your full
sun crop in late September and the rain is
[SPEAKER_11]: coming, you know, like all of a sudden
your A plus is going to maybe an A or even
[SPEAKER_11]: into a B.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in this market, the difference between
an A plus and an A is whether or not
[SPEAKER_11]: you're blasting it or it's going into a
jar.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that can make or break your business
right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you can be done right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So where did it all, where did the
inspiration come from?
[SPEAKER_11]: Really living in Mendocino back in the day
and pulling tarps and, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: looking at where everything was going and
me and all my friends, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: we all ate organic, drove biodiesel,
wore hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were, you know, really living that
lifestyle and talking that talk.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, but when you looked at it,
like all my friends had like 50,000 watts
[SPEAKER_11]: blowing up in their garage or their barn
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was like, okay, we're almost making
it happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how do we really take that next step?
[SPEAKER_11]: And really the idea was how do we reduce
that carbon footprint?
[SPEAKER_11]: How do we have an income, a crop that's
coming in all the time and not just that
[SPEAKER_11]: one crop?
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and how do we be responsible?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, how do we be responsible,
not just for our own bank accounts,
[SPEAKER_11]: but for what we're doing for the community
that we live in and for the planet that
[SPEAKER_11]: we're living on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so really for me, the idea came
looking at pulling tarps and, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: it really sucked having to wake up early
and pulling a tarp and then having to be
[SPEAKER_11]: back on the farm to pull the tarp at
night.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, you know, it was like,
that's just for the birds right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, so automation was the next step.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, really, you know,
looking into commercial ag and seeing
[SPEAKER_11]: what's already existed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause as we know, like we didn't,
for the most part, we're not inventing
[SPEAKER_11]: anything new in this industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of what we're doing is we're just
borrowing things that have already been
[SPEAKER_11]: successful in other industries.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're making it work for cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because yes, cannabis is a plant,
but for all those people that say it's
[SPEAKER_11]: just another plant and you grow it just
like the others, you know, I feel those
[SPEAKER_11]: people haven't really grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was a, that was back in 04 and
then started the company in 06.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as far as I know, it was the first
cannabis exclusive greenhouse company in
[SPEAKER_11]: the world back in 2006.
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, you know, we know people were
pulling tarps that are put in refrigerator
[SPEAKER_11]: boxes over plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it was happening, but it was the
first time that it was really looked at is
[SPEAKER_11]: how do we make this a commercial viable
product for a viably commercial industry?
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and so really back in the day was
just, you know, working in the quasi legal
[SPEAKER_11]: medical scene and just taking every penny
and throwing it into starting a company,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, where so many of my friends were
just buying property after property and
[SPEAKER_11]: trucks and vacations and all these things.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just dumping it all into,
into figuring out how to, how to move
[SPEAKER_11]: this, move this forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, here we are today, you know,
super grateful and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: super grateful, super grateful,
every penny of it, every penny,
[SPEAKER_11]: my salary, but yeah, you never let me pay
his salary one day late.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm super grateful for Eric,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: We wouldn't be here today without all your
work and all your dedication, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: You are, you know, give it up for it for
you, Mr. Branstad, the OMB.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, uh, you know, really today it's,
it is the future of the industry,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, and, um, I think it's really up
to us, you know, because on so many
[SPEAKER_11]: levels, you know, I just really have this,
this feeling, you know, there's a big
[SPEAKER_11]: circle, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of the cannabis industry and within the
cannabis industry is a smaller circle of
[SPEAKER_11]: the cannabis community, those of us that
have really, you know, given everything to
[SPEAKER_11]: make this happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And neither of us can exist without the
other at this point.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it takes the industry to provide
the efficiencies, the finances and the,
[SPEAKER_11]: the networks, if you will, to,
to really bring this into not only a
[SPEAKER_11]: national, but a global market,
but it takes the community in order to
[SPEAKER_11]: teach these folks how we do things and
bring the knowledge of the plant and bring
[SPEAKER_11]: the knowledge of the cannabis community
into what we're doing so that we can
[SPEAKER_11]: really have that impact on the,
on the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, really use business as the
religion that it is today, because it is
[SPEAKER_11]: the religion that rules the world today.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't see any problems with
corporations.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see any problems with business,
but if we can bring, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: the, the knowledge, the sacredness and
the, uh, the community that we've all
[SPEAKER_11]: built into it, then we have the
opportunity to change this world in a
[SPEAKER_11]: heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and, and really bring forth,
uh, you know, everything that's going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause what we're really doing is we're
growing crystals, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And crystals carry knowledge and
information and intelligence.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so if we can, every time we're growing
a plant in bed, those crystals with the
[SPEAKER_11]: knowledge that we want to go out,
that's going to go, you know, I always
[SPEAKER_11]: used to love to think of like,
whenever you harvested a crop,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's like, where is this going to be
smoked?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I know this one guy is bringing a
half pound over to Hawaii and these people
[SPEAKER_11]: are bringing an eighth with them over to,
uh, Jamaica or wherever it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we're spreading that knowledge
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: And every time somebody intakes that,
then, uh, then we've, we've done our job
[SPEAKER_11]: of just spreading that love just a little
bit further.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at you guy go right on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, well, I mean, I'm super grateful for,
uh, this whole light depth scene and these
[SPEAKER_07]: crystal growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a minor, so you guys grow the
crystals.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll mine the things and, uh,
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I, I appreciate the educational piece
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to jump over to farmer Tom
real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause farmer Tom, uh, mentioned,
uh, what he was doing at the community
[SPEAKER_07]: college and the education level.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of wanted you to tell us a
little bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to also ask you about the
feds one more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the feds came to your house and
came into your greenhouse and hung out
[SPEAKER_07]: with you at your place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was this at an undisclosed location?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they came to my house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, they came to my house in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I guess for two days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they came to your house and saw your
growth, saw your greenhouse, saw your,
[SPEAKER_07]: where you kept your say, I mean,
what didn't they see?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, they've pretty much they saw,
you know, everything we've, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just been medical growers for a long time
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, we were, uh,
Biden by all the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really didn't have much to hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I would have rather
educated them on kind of where the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry came from and all of our roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we were all, you know,
we grow organic vegetables along with our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, it's more like a lifestyle,
a health choice for my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, she can, you know,
if she can't live in the city,
[SPEAKER_01]: she can't be around, you know,
petrochemical products, perfumes,
[SPEAKER_01]: any of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we created this lifestyle and,
uh, you know, it's, it's worked for us
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, having them, them here,
they've actually become pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in contact with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're, they're scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, this is, uh, uh, agents from
the CDC and NIOSH and NIOSH stands for
[SPEAKER_01]: national Institute of occupational safety
and health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, basically they're PhD scientists
and, and they wanted to get ahead of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the ball on a worldwide platform before
another group did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are the premier people on
workers' safety and health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they wanted to get a jump on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this all really went back to Denver in
like 2011 and 12, when the police union up
[SPEAKER_01]: there filed a complaint with OSHA saying
that they were afraid their officers were
[SPEAKER_01]: being poisoned with molds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they would go into these grows,
the lights would be off for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: days and they'd be in there like cleaning
up that there would be powdery mildews.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, black molds and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, the Obama administration allocated
funds to do this, uh, workplace health and
[SPEAKER_01]: safety evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's just basically a scientific
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they came twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, you know, we, and the first time it
was on my, it was my dime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm being a advocate for so
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we showed them, we smoked around
them and, you know, showed them our
[SPEAKER_01]: lifestyle and, uh, the second time was
more business oriented and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting data for production and
processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each day I did a different task.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we had a total of like 70 plants that
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time they came in the later
part of October, we had 10 left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first day was all about big leafing
and harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we harvested the 10 plants and then big
leafed and then moved it into the drying
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second day was all about bucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were, uh, taking the buds off of
the, off of the stems form every different
[SPEAKER_01]: way we could come from the hand to the
little tin can method to the scissors,
[SPEAKER_01]: to which, whichever way we could to give
them data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third day was all about
trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we had machine trims, hand trim that
hooked us up with the cyber glove that
[SPEAKER_01]: track repetitive motion and collected the
data and all that data was compiled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's, uh, it's a, it's a scientific
study paid by the pay for by the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, of the government and the
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in the library of Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess you could look it up under
cannabis and organic cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so organic cannabis is the key word in
that study or what you showed them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically it was, you know, coming from an
organic place and, uh, using greenhouses
[SPEAKER_07]: and things like that, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it sounds like you showed them
the side that we all kind of are all an
[SPEAKER_01]: advocate for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I wanted to show them what we're
all about and what we, what we came from
[SPEAKER_01]: and really give them a, a good perception
of where we all came from and who we
[SPEAKER_01]: really are as a community.
[SPEAKER_07]: How did they choose you again?
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you say, how did they actually come to
you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, cause you got busted a long time ago
or no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Washington state, we, we did a,
a news piece with Como news.
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked me to do an open blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody thought I was crazy,
but I thought, well, this is a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to educate them on it because
they were coming to the farmer's markets
[SPEAKER_01]: at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their idea of hash was one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was BHO and people were killing
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go, well, this is a perfect
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, it's January,
February, and I can get like my friends
[SPEAKER_01]: together and we'll give them a four hour
symposium on everything concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Joe Wynn did an open blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: For him outside under a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had farmer Joe Parker doing a closed
loop system inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had samples of bubble hash,
of course, and CO2 and FICO and that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff to kind of show them that,
wow, there's a lot more here than just
[SPEAKER_01]: BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you, when you ban all
concentrates, all you're really doing is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, these kids will continue to blow
themselves up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's better to tax it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, that kind of led to me
getting some exposure up here on
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a kid, the kid blew themselves up
in a BHO explosion in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the union got in touch with me
and then we got in touch with OSHA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I took them over to JD's from
Skunk Farm Research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent afternoon educating them about
hydrocarbons and why these kids were
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing themselves up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that, they picked me and my wife
because we had already interacted with
[SPEAKER_01]: them to do the health hazard evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was initiated by the union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually these are punitive type
things, you know, like we're going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and find out, you know, what your
industry is up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after talking with them and we were
the first ones, you know, I figured,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, we might as well just go in there and
lay a baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather it be me than some suit in a,
you know, in some other location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we agreed to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, you know, they made my farm a secure
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to pretty much be vetted by the DOJ
to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went through a lot of hoops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Obama, it was actually finished in
2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, April, 2016,
and it went up, I guess, online for a few
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they pulled it down because it
was an election year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they kind of kicked the ball to
Austin.
[SPEAKER_01]: August and August said, Oh, it's an
election year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's kick the ball to November.
[SPEAKER_01]: November comes around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, we got a new administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's kick the ball to February.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kicked it to February of 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, Oh, we've got a new appointee for
the department of health and human
[SPEAKER_01]: services.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to kick it till April.
[SPEAKER_01]: I contacted James couch, who's the chief
scientist on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, you know, we're in contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called him and he said, he was on home
and maternity leave that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he didn't have any updates on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the next morning, the box showed up
overnight at my, at my door.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had, I don't know, four or five reports
and then posters that we can hang in our
[SPEAKER_01]: workplace, basically of what they found
and what they suggested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and then like I said, on April
7th, it went up on online again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in August, I got my own website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in between that, we, I've gotten
emails from them saying that Cal OSHA is
[SPEAKER_01]: using this as their baseline for workplace
health and safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using the report that,
you know, our SOPs that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: created the report.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, that's how we, that's,
that's kind of what we did with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much the whole story.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing, Tom.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been wanting to kind of hear that
story.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I've seen you and known you for a
while, but I never really get a chance.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're always so busy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, so to jump back into the
greenhouse talk a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to go over to Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been patiently waiting as our
hosts and they're good at being patient
[SPEAKER_07]: with some of these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now I wanted to jump into some more
greenhouse talk on the Wallopini side of
[SPEAKER_07]: things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, um, you guys got a hoop house
this year too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, what have we been seeing
in the Wallopini?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we seeing in the other
greenhouse, you know, especially up where
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys are in your special climate,
like tell us a little bit about the closed
[SPEAKER_07]: loop farm and your greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, first of all, Jonathan, thank you so
much, you know, brother, love everything
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have to say and really bringing
it back to the fact that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we are growing crystals.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're growing sentient beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're affecting people's lives every
single day with every single smoke that we
[SPEAKER_03]: put out, every bud we could be affecting
their lives as a whole, or just that
[SPEAKER_03]: minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just so important to, you know,
thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So on, on our land, we have five different
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_13]: We live far up north.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the mountains, we're in a big mountain
canyon and we don't get full sun exposure
[SPEAKER_13]: every day.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really have to take advantage of our
suns, uh, of the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, when we light depth, we usually
are light depping right around the time
[SPEAKER_13]: when the sun's hitting the mountain,
even in the middle of the summer.
[SPEAKER_13]: So luckily we don't get a really,
um, a lot of heat in there, um,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, towards the evening and stuff,
but we have, uh, five different
[SPEAKER_13]: greenhouses, um, a circular one that's
submerged into the earth about nine feet
[SPEAKER_13]: and then a really long Wally Pini that's a
40 by 70 that's dug.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on a hillside and on the back wall,
it's 10 feet in the ground and in the
[SPEAKER_13]: front walls around six feet to the,
to the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's got a big flat, uh, an angled
roof on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, we, uh, also have a hoop house
that we got from Forever Flowering.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've gotten lots of equipment from
Forever Flowering for our other stuff,
[SPEAKER_13]: but we also build, um, greenhouses from,
um, from, uh, wood and local materials
[SPEAKER_13]: from our land.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, what really works for us best is a
flow through style design for our
[SPEAKER_13]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we do get a lot of rain in the summer
and also we can get it really early in the
[SPEAKER_13]: fall.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really like to use our greenhouses
and utilize, um, it more as a roof without
[SPEAKER_13]: ever, um, you know, our walls never come
down in the summer.
[SPEAKER_13]: We only have the summer walls come down in
the spring time or only in the spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as our temperatures change really
drastically, you know, in the evening,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as soon as it starts to become
summertime and we're having really hot
[SPEAKER_03]: days and cold nights, because that's what
happens up in the mountains where we are,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's absolutely imperative that
those sides and the end walls never get
[SPEAKER_03]: closed, you know, and that's something
that we've been learning, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: through time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we want to be able to grow these
really beautiful varieties that are really
[SPEAKER_03]: important to get out on the market in our
Northern area, we have to be able to light
[SPEAKER_03]: up and we do it old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're for the birds.
[SPEAKER_13]: We like birds.
[SPEAKER_14]: We like birds.
[SPEAKER_13]: We would love to have an automated
greenhouse one day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I still pull some tarps myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, uh, I, uh, wanted to know,
um, do you guys use any fans or any kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of electricity in any of your greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we really don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to, and we just realized that it's
really not necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have enough airflow on the mountain
side that we're on to just open it up and
[SPEAKER_03]: the way that the mountains breathe is that
we have like an uptake of air in the
[SPEAKER_03]: morning time, and then a down take of air
in the evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really blows through all of the
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really suggest to people,
you know, that before you do the layout of
[SPEAKER_03]: your greenhouses, you stand on your land,
you find out the airflow, you find out
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly what's going on with your sun and
your moon rising points.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have frost.
[SPEAKER_13]: So where does it frost first?
[SPEAKER_13]: Where does it frost second?
[SPEAKER_13]: Where's the sun and the wind?
[SPEAKER_13]: Where's the sun in the winter?
[SPEAKER_13]: Where's the sun in the summer?
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to think about that pretty,
pretty seriously.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, uh, we also purposefully build
our greenhouses to have, um, a natural
[SPEAKER_13]: flow through design.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've worked really hard at trying to
make this design work.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now we've got to a point where we
don't have fans.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're walking into a totally peaceful
environment that has beds that are
[SPEAKER_13]: attached to the earth.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have different, um, um, pieces.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have different kinds of dirt on our
land.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we take, we take different parts of
dirt from our land and we make dirt and
[SPEAKER_13]: we've been layering them over the years.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have a unique style of dirt in our,
that's not non-commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soil's number one focus.
[SPEAKER_13]: Non-commercial.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we build a gravity fed
greenhouse, a tea house to feed our teas
[SPEAKER_13]: into our greenhouses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we like having different environments
and we grow the plants differently based
[SPEAKER_13]: off different, different greenhouse
styles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we definitely realize that utilizing
geothermal along with our greenhouses has
[SPEAKER_03]: been a tremendous step forward for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've been, we started out in
big outdoor and gorilla growing and then
[SPEAKER_03]: moved all the way into greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thought that we maybe needed to
have a lot of fans and lights and all this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're pretty much down to just the
cover and, uh, light depping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really feel like we've got it
figured out now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you guys have consulted on
greenhouses other than just where you are,
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as, uh, help design some,
I think we helped you, or just provide
[SPEAKER_07]: some materials for in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so did the Colorado Wallopini and for
everybody that maybe doesn't know
[SPEAKER_07]: Wallopini greenhouses are in the earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're, you know, mostly a roof sticking
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know you guys have done a few
different designs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the one in Colorado, how did that go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just so absolutely stoked with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't had any issues in it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely the one that they put
their number one strains in and the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're really looking towards to,
you know, produce maybe mother plants or,
[SPEAKER_03]: or possibly for cups.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they also have, um, a high elevation
with strong winds.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, as long as the sides and the
roof are kind of, you know, battened down,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, pretty well, um, the Wallopini offers
a really good, um, break, uh, for the wind
[SPEAKER_13]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, they've, they've had a really
good time.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're expanding, um, on their farm and
getting into hemp farming and doing other
[SPEAKER_13]: things.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's been helpful to their
expansion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also there's a tremendous difference
between the day and the night in Colorado
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just really helps to put it into
the ground because you're just not having
[SPEAKER_03]: those extremes, the geothermal sort of,
you know, aids in that.
[SPEAKER_13]: The one thing I just, I was, I think we
would just like to say is that in a time
[SPEAKER_13]: where like places like Cape Town have run
out of water and California's seen severe
[SPEAKER_13]: droughts, water saving, growing techniques
can potentially outweigh the need for,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, you know, being able to get five
cycles in one day.
[SPEAKER_13]: One year, cause a lot of times people use
pots and greenhouses in order to get a
[SPEAKER_13]: fast turnover rate, maybe in California,
so they can get five rounds in a year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe that's why they shy away from
using beds because beds, you might have to
[SPEAKER_13]: let them veg for a week or two to kind of
get their roots into the ground,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it's going to save you up to 50 to 70%
water.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's also going to allow your
microorganisms to feed your terpenes and
[SPEAKER_13]: terpene levels and the crystal content.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we think that's really valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also tremendous amount, you know,
we need to look at every single cost right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we reduce our costs and still grow
the fire?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how can we get out the highest
quality product?
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes we really do need to look at
our systems fully and figure out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what's going to be best for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just sort of talking about, you know,
for years, I showed people how to make
[SPEAKER_04]: hash using water and ice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it's very simple for,
for extracting resin, but the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the real, real trick is to drying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the drying it, depending on where you
are, becomes a different recipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure with greenhouses,
it's the same thing where someone might be
[SPEAKER_04]: hearing Dragonfly talk about how we just
leave the sides of the greenhouses open
[SPEAKER_04]: where in a different place, maybe in
Holland or wherever, it might not be the
[SPEAKER_04]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for those of you that are listening,
understand that each person specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: talking is talking about their specific
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it may be a little bit different
depending on where you're growing and what
[SPEAKER_04]: type of greenhouse you're using.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to mention that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things I've learned over the 11
years I've been doing this is that
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis does want to be free.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't want to be always trapped.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we trap things, we have to deal
with trapping air, for instance,
[SPEAKER_07]: when we trap air, it heats up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so one of the things about greenhouses
in general, greenhouses were invented for
[SPEAKER_07]: winter time.
[SPEAKER_07]: There wasn't anybody on a farm on a hot
summer day that went, Oh shit,
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when we have cannabis growers,
cannabis growers love to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a super hot sunny spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what do we have?
[SPEAKER_07]: We have kind of two things that don't make
sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a greenhouse in this hot ass spot
and a grower that's trying to grow inside
[SPEAKER_07]: of a greenhouse in this hot ass spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why we see a lot of the high
failure rates for people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the discouragement of greenhouses
sometimes is because it's almost turned
[SPEAKER_07]: into this a hybrid indoor grow room.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this idea that we get free sun and
then the greenhouse is, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: this controlled environment and not
everybody can control their environment,
[SPEAKER_07]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_07]: Controlling an environment is temp and
humidity for the most part.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, we can work on the temp and
humidity in the greenhouse, but what can
[SPEAKER_07]: we do about the leaf surface temperature,
maybe the ground temperature, the soil
[SPEAKER_07]: temperatures, all these other surfaces
heat up as well as the air temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when we have surfaces, soils,
things heating up, we create these hostile
[SPEAKER_07]: environments.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we create hostile environments,
cannabis just gives up and basically sends
[SPEAKER_07]: out those invitations for bugs,
PM, molds and whatever can happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we found over the last few
years, no matter what state we're in,
[SPEAKER_07]: for the most part in the United States,
you know, we do a lot of our greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially this one back here,
our Northern Latitude kind of cookie
[SPEAKER_07]: cutter, because I believe greenhouses
should be flexible in the sense that they
[SPEAKER_07]: can have winter mode and summer mode both
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that means the ability to open up and
to close up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most greenhouses, you know, for the most
part run on two ways of ventilation,
[SPEAKER_07]: mechanical ventilation that's sealed up
with exhaust fans and intakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's passive ventilation with
the greenhouse ability to open up and
[SPEAKER_07]: close the side walls and the roof vent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so basically what happens is that,
you know, the flexibility comes with
[SPEAKER_07]: having the advantages to open the
greenhouse up or close it should you need
[SPEAKER_07]: to.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we found is that sealed greenhouses
in most part that are trapping air and
[SPEAKER_07]: heating up in these hot summer spots
really have to use mechanical ventilation
[SPEAKER_07]: because there's no other way to exchange
that air.
[SPEAKER_07]: At some points, the air can keep up for
the exchange rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, one air exchange per minute is
national greenhouse manufacturer
[SPEAKER_07]: standards.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if the fans can't keep up,
we have trapped air that's heating up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what we have is plant
transpiration, which turns into
[SPEAKER_07]: condensation in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so condensation is everybody's biggest
fear.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if people have condensation nine times
out of 10, it's from plant sweat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we have to do is back up and
help avoid that plant sweat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the one way we can do that is through
cooling the surface and cooling the
[SPEAKER_07]: surfaces isn't just cooling the air in
order to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: To cool the surfaces, we try to open up
the greenhouse, use the proper greenhouse
[SPEAKER_07]: covers like these diffuse greenhouse
covers you see behind me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also using things like white ground
cover and things that avoid sun or solar
[SPEAKER_07]: gain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Black ground cover, black grow bags,
all these things encourage a lot more
[SPEAKER_07]: surface temp than you'd want.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so by using tan grow bags and a white
ground cover and even a little infrared
[SPEAKER_07]: thermometer to shoot and point and shoot
the leaf surface temperature of a plant
[SPEAKER_07]: can really tell you a lot more than the
typical temp and humidity thermostat that
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of people want to look at for the
word control, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, we really want to make
greenhouses flexible.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to keep cannabis free.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if we need to fight Mother
Nature, we can do that closer to the
[SPEAKER_07]: season extending or the winter time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that one of the things that
comes up with all this is also the quality
[SPEAKER_07]: because we can't just get a greenhouse and
go, OK, I'm going to get the killer
[SPEAKER_07]: quality and win all the cups like JD and
all these other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really takes these, you know,
the correct method to the madness,
[SPEAKER_07]: along with knowing how to deal with the
method to the madness in these specific
[SPEAKER_07]: areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: These specific areas need these pieces of
equipment to operate how the grower needs
[SPEAKER_07]: to at certain times of the year so that
they can actually make it work for
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And granted, there are some exceptions to
the rules, but what we saw this year was
[SPEAKER_07]: sealed greenhouses and mechanically
ventilated greenhouses that only had the
[SPEAKER_07]: way to move the airs through the exhaust
fans and the intakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether it's a wet wall or not,
even people with wet walls had air coming
[SPEAKER_07]: in at 75 and leaving the greenhouse at 130
degrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of the sealed greenhouses that we
talked to this year didn't have the fans
[SPEAKER_07]: calculated properly, so they did have
solar gain, which created that hostile
[SPEAKER_07]: environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last thing that happens is if you
lose electricity, you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so a passively ventilated greenhouse
can help avoid problems if you do lose
[SPEAKER_07]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, something maybe everybody
could answer on real quick is that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I see a lot of people talk
about, you know, indoor being better than
[SPEAKER_07]: sungrown, indoor being better than
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, some of the greenhouse material
I've seen is hard to compare to indoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to know the difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there are consumers out there that
don't really know the difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just want good weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's also the retail sellers,
let's say, that are really trying to stick
[SPEAKER_07]: with indoors better than sungrown.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they change the price or they
make the price lower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody see any of this going on in
their farms or pricing or who they deal
[SPEAKER_07]: with as far as sungrown or greenhouse
versus indoor and prices wise?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I just want to say really quickly,
I think what happens on the market is any
[SPEAKER_11]: time any time light debt or greenhouse is
super good, it'll get marketed as indoor
[SPEAKER_11]: just because it fetches that higher price.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think it's really doing a
disservice to the greenhouse light debt
[SPEAKER_11]: sector of the market.
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, I mean, you can't
really blame people for wanting to get a
[SPEAKER_11]: better price or actually move their
product.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so it's it's kind of a
conundrum.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where I think it comes down to,
you know, constantly comes back to to
[SPEAKER_11]: education, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: And and I think as we still are getting
more lab results and more scientific
[SPEAKER_11]: studies are being done, you know,
we're really able to start seeing what
[SPEAKER_11]: terpenes are brought out by by sunshine,
you know, where does UV come into the
[SPEAKER_11]: factor?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and and so one thing I just
wanted to say about growing in the
[SPEAKER_11]: greenhouse, though, going back is,
you know, really, again, comes back to
[SPEAKER_11]: having a proper greenhouse design.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I've been living up and growing
in the Sierras here for, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: well over a decade and decade and a half
up here in the Sierras.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we get a lot of questions about how
we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think one of the things that I've
put up into the hundreds plus is and I've
[SPEAKER_11]: never had an exhaust fan on my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never had a cooling system on my
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a lot of people are being
steered into the direction of thinking
[SPEAKER_11]: that they need to have HVAC systems or wet
walls to really or even high pressure
[SPEAKER_11]: fogging systems to mitigate something that
doesn't necessarily need to be mitigated.
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming from an indoor environment,
people are usually focused on what's the
[SPEAKER_11]: temp and humidity, what's the temp and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all that they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_11]: But once you get into a greenhouse,
you really have the ability to start
[SPEAKER_11]: looking at leaf surface temperatures at
root zone temperatures.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where we really start getting
into, you know, the true growing
[SPEAKER_11]: environment for the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the ambient temperature of the
greenhouse can be super hot.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if that if you get the cooler
temperatures down on the leaf and in the
[SPEAKER_11]: root zone, you can actually go around
having to have any sort of mechanical
[SPEAKER_11]: cooling and such.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, as long as you've got that
proper passive cooling and you've got a
[SPEAKER_11]: high quality material that the sun's
coming through.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people like to skimp on on their
greenhouse cover and put up some sort of
[SPEAKER_11]: like visqueen or, you know, just a single
layer poly.
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, that's what the sun's coming
through.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that is that's your separation
between your source of the plant growth
[SPEAKER_11]: and the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so really one of the best things that
a person can do and the most cost
[SPEAKER_11]: effective to improve their greenhouse is
to just put a proper cover on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have a polyweave cover that's got a
high diffusion level and even blocks out a
[SPEAKER_11]: minor amount of the sun to really soften
the light, you're going to have plants
[SPEAKER_11]: that get more blingy because they're not
in the harsh environment of the sun just
[SPEAKER_11]: beating down on them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're not in a visqueen material,
which is actually the focus are magnifying
[SPEAKER_11]: the light and creating hot spots within
within the greenhouse environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as soon as you have that hostile
environment, that's when molds,
[SPEAKER_11]: mildews, pests and diseases are going to
move in because your plants not healthy.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's basically sending out this message
of I need to be decomposed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so nature is just coming in and like,
oh, we're just going to take this one out.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it really comes back to creating
that beautiful growing environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Both in the air and then in the soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's like a whole nother rant right
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the soil is a whole nother thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody have any comments on the using the
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_07]: Siobhan, we haven't heard from you a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us about your greenhouse and style.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys manual depth, auto depths.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, currently for blessed coast,
we're pretty lacking, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_14]: But my background in a greenhouse is was
my dad did black box and I moved into
[SPEAKER_14]: greenhouses as the market was still
getting prices for indoor for debt.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: you use the term black box.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So but but I mean, that was dad,
you know, but I then moved into just
[SPEAKER_14]: falling in love with the fact that it was
outdoor and I could be producing high
[SPEAKER_14]: quality to sell at a better rate.
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, we need greenhouses for blessed
coast.
[SPEAKER_14]: So so hopefully that will be happening
this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I missed my days of pulling tarps.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be completely honest.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it was the there was a comment
made about the trash and the just get a
[SPEAKER_14]: proper greenhouse, essentially.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the biggest thing that really
killed me about this industry was the
[SPEAKER_14]: trash.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I'm happy that we're moving into,
you know, a better slate for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But also Jonathan, I wanted to say thank
you for bringing up Dennis Perrone,
[SPEAKER_14]: honoring that and honoring our forefathers
in this in this.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I think that the leaning towards the
test testing comment was also really where
[SPEAKER_14]: we're going with this.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're really going to have to step it up
as far as cleanliness and greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_14]: crystals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did your dad use black box to black box
each plant or was that just a term that he
[SPEAKER_07]: used?
[SPEAKER_02]: They dug theirs into the ground and then
covered it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome, because my first
experience in Humboldt was in ninety two,
[SPEAKER_07]: ninety three and people were actually
using cardboard boxes to individually
[SPEAKER_07]: black box each plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's where the term black box and
kind of came from.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I remember those.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, this was in the ground.
[SPEAKER_14]: Doug, with a backhoe also called a P.D.H.
[SPEAKER_14]: pre dug hole just in case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was up there, everybody was calling
it black boxing and black boxing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The weed actually sucked.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was really terrible looking
herb at the time because the people that I
[SPEAKER_07]: was dealing with were really young and we
were all just, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: what is this and what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody wasn't very organized at
all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was no elders guiding anybody
along the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't have our family up there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I recall it going back.
[SPEAKER_14]: The black box kind of faded out and it
went back to outdoor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, it kind of converted it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the whole greenhouse in depth,
I mean, it just the market, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: changed everything up.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was so interesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: I missed the days of pulling tarps.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have rattlesnake snake stories and like
I would love an automatic greenhouse
[SPEAKER_14]: because tarps rattlesnakes fucking flying
through the air like I don't think people
[SPEAKER_07]: understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help me out.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you when you have a tarp laying on
the ground for a day in the summertime,
[SPEAKER_07]: snakes and all kinds of things get into
that tarp.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you go pull the tarp,
the tension of it makes everything spring
[SPEAKER_07]: out of the tarp.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you can find rattlesnakes and mice
and all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, pulling tarps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it isn't just the pain in the ass of
actually pulling the tarp.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like what's hiding in the tarp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it get rained on?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it full of pus?
[SPEAKER_14]: You just never know.
[SPEAKER_14]: You just never know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I do, though.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I want to complain about those
days, but I miss it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I miss it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I miss riding dirt bikes and having,
you know, a good time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm I'm coming to you guys now from my
office because I'm so fancy.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, what a what a crazy ride to to
be on and what an interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole greenhouse effect.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, thanks for inviting me on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's good to have you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I mean, you've been around it
for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, the history that you that I
talk about, you definitely know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I talked to some people over the course of
the years and the people that went to
[SPEAKER_07]: Humboldt in the 70s were black boxing in
order to sex plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they would actually use boxes all
over the little plants to sex them before
[SPEAKER_07]: they put them out into the field.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so light depth greenhouse,
light depth black box, light depth in
[SPEAKER_07]: general has been part of the history of
cannabis, you know, for a really long
[SPEAKER_07]: time, longer than I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've traced it back, like I said,
into the 70s of Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's really, you know, great to be
here in a sense that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: all these years later, I'm in a company
and the presence of all these people doing
[SPEAKER_07]: this light depth thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really like, you know,
part of the culture now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's yeah, it's it's blown up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so does anybody have any other points
they want to bring up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wanted to say really quickly,
Eric and to everybody is that I feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of us probably could relate to
this, too, is that, you know, talking to
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers in the market, you know,
the sun grown and the light depth makes
[SPEAKER_03]: you feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just does.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you smoke something that's from a
light depth, not only is it beautiful and
[SPEAKER_03]: flavorful and it has a lot of turpines,
but it makes you feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes you be ready for your day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it resembles more of where that
plant came from rather than coming from an
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor space, you know, like you all are
saying earlier with a lot of the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the buzz and the vibration and the
electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really wanted to say, yeah,
and also moving over this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the also the diffused light is
really important in California.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think in Southern Oregon, I think the
light, the sunlight gets too hot and it
[SPEAKER_13]: can blast the plants and the buds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the turpines are volatile on the
plants, even when they're growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So sometimes I mean, people are exploring,
you know, having shade cloths in their
[SPEAKER_13]: greenhouse in the middle of the day in
Southern Oregon and Northern California
[SPEAKER_13]: and Southern Oregon where it's super hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's even some misters and stuff
being used above it to continue having the
[SPEAKER_13]: right type of humidity that it takes to
grow crystals.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, you know, there's all kinds of
different light spectrums and come in.
[SPEAKER_13]: But one thing we're exploring is UVD,
which is putting a disco ball in our
[SPEAKER_13]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that really brings on the fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, just check into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we're going to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get a disco ball and hang it
in here just for you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And see what kind of turps we we bring
out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe junk man Sam, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would be interested to hear about your
progression of, you know, greenhouse
[SPEAKER_13]: growing and some of your maybe your life
deprivation experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing in greenhouses ever
since the first year I grew cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in maybe 70, 72 or something
around like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just a homemade primitive
greenhouse once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And friends of mine were doing darkening
for sexing, not for flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for sexing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: But tell them what we just talked about
about the sexing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems with the sexing was at
that time, they didn't really understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would darken it for two weeks
until the plant showed sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas what the research that I found
when we were doing the research in Holland
[SPEAKER_00]: was that most indica varieties,
you can darken for one day and then two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks later they will show sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not stay long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with veg, with sativa varieties,
sometimes they need to be darkened two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three days at the very most.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then two weeks later, they show the
sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's I mean, I had a friend who
produced thousands and thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings and then darkened them off just
for sexing to sell early known female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few times, because he darkened them
for two weeks, they would not come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the customers were rather irate that
they had these little plants that were two
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall and flowered off and they would
not return veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you also tell the story of how you
discovered greenhouse light depth in
[SPEAKER_04]: Holland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, greenhouse light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened was I went into a
chrysanthemum greenhouse because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in building my own greenhouse
or buying one or renting one or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I saw the chrysanthemums were being
darkened to induce flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a light went on in my head and I went,
Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had seen people darken plants
with a tarp in the late 70s and early 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wasn't interested because I wanted a
greenhouse that was multiple acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't hand darken multiple acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually you can if you have enough
labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's so once I saw what darkening
could do, I instantly understood what this
[SPEAKER_00]: was for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was, I don't know,
maybe 86 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I saw that, yeah, I never stepped
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Netherlands, you need darkening
because you can grow multiple crops a year
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can grow one big, good,
heavy crop and darken it and get it out
[SPEAKER_00]: before the cold comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your heating bills are 10 pounds a
thousand dollars a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you also comment, Sam,
on earlier Micah was talking, Micah was
[SPEAKER_04]: talking and he mentioned how he kind of
likes to keep them a little bit smaller,
[SPEAKER_04]: which might be perfect for what he's doing
and producing super high quality flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you came in as a sort of like,
oh, I'd like to have really big
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouses and maybe just talk to why
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the main reason is I like big
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the work I'm doing is not
commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for breeding work, I start seeds,
thousands and thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I do is I want to pick the
best plants and to pick the best plant
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to do with a little
one or two foot plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow at 12 feet tall and you get a
really good idea of its positive and
[SPEAKER_00]: negative qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a breeder, it's really required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I had a very high ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ceiling was maybe 20 feet or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could grow 15 foot tall plants if I
want, get three, four or five kilos of
[SPEAKER_00]: dried material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask you, Sam, about the sexing one
more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, for people that are,
you know, maybe don't have a lot of power
[SPEAKER_07]: still in Humboldt or, you know,
these craft farmers, if they were to sex
[SPEAKER_07]: their plants, like you were saying,
how long if it was it's dependent on
[SPEAKER_07]: strain, you would say.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if somebody was to do it, would you
say to darken it for a day or two instead
[SPEAKER_07]: of the two weeks like your friend had
done?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I experienced the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen plants that didn't come back out
of the veg and it was a huge pain in the
[SPEAKER_07]: ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you talk a little bit more about
that, like your recommendation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is my mic on?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing is that cannabis will take
two weeks to express its sex, but one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two days of darkening is enough to trip
the expression two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main thing you have to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: With earlier varieties, only one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a very late, late equatorial
variety, maybe it takes two or three days
[SPEAKER_00]: at the very most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you put them back on a long
cycle, two weeks later, they sex,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't stay flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are totally veg and you grow them
really, really big and then flower them
[SPEAKER_00]: off and you know what sex is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's almost like at the end of that,
you should also say you're welcome because
[SPEAKER_04]: that was a gem right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, dude, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolute game changer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for dropping that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's all I needed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk to you guys later.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike, did you I saw you were going to
chime in a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you about to drop some wisdom on us?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know if I'd call it wisdom,
but I was going to say something.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to follow Sam, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Him and Jonathan are hard to follow.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we love y'all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, you got it.
[SPEAKER_10]: What was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_09]: It was about you were talking about
Jonathan kind of commented on the
[SPEAKER_09]: difference between indoor looking quality
and how you can grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pricing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pricing and stuff like that, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that that light deprivation
when done right can absolutely compete
[SPEAKER_09]: with the indoor market, both in the
testing results and also the way bag
[SPEAKER_09]: appeal, the way it looks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did this kind of fun little test
with a friend of ours this last year where
[SPEAKER_09]: we gave him some of the same cuts we were
running, same nutrient program,
[SPEAKER_09]: everything that we were doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: He ran it indoors.
[SPEAKER_09]: We ran it in a light deprivation and we
tested it at the end of the year and we
[SPEAKER_09]: ended up being higher on the THC test and
you know everything else.
[SPEAKER_09]: That we both tested for, which was
basically the THC thing with the
[SPEAKER_09]: competition.
[SPEAKER_09]: So sometimes when I hear people talking
about the indoor, there's no way you can
[SPEAKER_09]: compete with the indoor market.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that's a false.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that, and I agree with what the
people at Dragonfly were saying is that
[SPEAKER_09]: everything about it's better.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's grown naturally in the sun,
tastes better, better for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then with pricing, like with what,
and this is just kind of my personal
[SPEAKER_09]: opinion or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that in California, which is where
I'm at, I don't know if everyone's in
[SPEAKER_09]: California or not, but there's a big
hiccup in the market right now with what's
[SPEAKER_09]: going on and we've got this big change in
regulation and dispensaries and all this
[SPEAKER_09]: other stuff that's going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's hard to compete with the indoor
market, especially in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that what could end up being
the savior to what we're passionate about,
[SPEAKER_09]: sun-grown farming, is I think that with
pricing going up the way that it is,
[SPEAKER_09]: these people that are going into
dispensaries and all of a sudden seeing
[SPEAKER_09]: their price tag being 80, 90 dollars for
the eight that they used to get for 45 or
[SPEAKER_09]: 50 bucks is definitely gonna be a way that
I'm hoping sun-grown farmers can survive.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's gonna be a positive for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Educate, educate, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't we quantify things with lab tests
sometimes?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know that I've talked to a few
lab companies that have said over the
[SPEAKER_07]: course of time some of the greenhouse
material they've been testing has tested
[SPEAKER_07]: higher in the THC, CBD, and even the
terpene percentages.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that the terpene companies,
Bubble Man, maybe you might know something
[SPEAKER_07]: about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: With greenhouse material and the terpene
production that you might have heard about
[SPEAKER_07]: or known.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see, am I unmuted?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right from Tony's mouth, almost always the
lightstaff, the greenhouse is gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: produce a way higher level of terpene
production.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just a smaller amount, but a
substantially larger amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not to change the subject completely,
but while I have the mic, one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: things Sam was mentioning about greenhouse
triggering flowering as well, particularly
[SPEAKER_04]: in, I guess it was in close to the equator
countries where they have 12 hours and 12
[SPEAKER_04]: hours of light and darkness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And often people are trying to grow with
added light, additional light.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll maybe put it on for another five
or six hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam had an interesting bit of information
to share on tropical cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what we found is that in the
Netherlands when I would grow big giant
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at 10, 12 feet tall over the
winter, I could give as little as,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using these little 60 watt blue
incandescent agricultural balls from
[SPEAKER_00]: Phillips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were geared towards,
but they were only 60 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would use one of those for every 10
square meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a hundred square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it absolutely prevented flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but you could use as little
as just, instead of giving them six or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight hours of light to keep them veg,
what you could do is just in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the night, give them two hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big one for people that have
been, especially in countries where,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, he was mentioning like only
having one generator, only being able to
[SPEAKER_04]: turn on enough light in one section of the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do a quarter here, a quarter
there, a quarter there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of leaving it on for that
eight additional hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you how severe I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually was storing plants under
refrigeration at about plus three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're in a refrigerator with lights
and alls I gave them was 15 minutes of
[SPEAKER_00]: light four times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every five hours I'd give them or five
or six hours, I give them 15 minutes of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, totally prevented flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stayed veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also weren't growing because it was
so cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alls I was trying to do was keep the
plants alive as a library.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you see that there was any reduction
in actual growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: No growth practically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, under three degrees, there's
practically zero growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't trying to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to maintain them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But my, I guess my question is,
is, you know, I think some people would
[SPEAKER_11]: argue, will they keep all these lights on?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because not only do they want to keep the
photo period going, but they're also
[SPEAKER_11]: trying to have the plant grow at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just curious if you saw any
difference at any point in your,
[SPEAKER_11]: in your experiences where there,
you could see like a difference in growth,
[SPEAKER_11]: growth rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more lumens and the more hours,
of course, you're going to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that wasn't my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal was to, I had big plants in the
ground, which I conserved in my
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a small collection on, on ebb and
flow tables under, under halides and just
[SPEAKER_00]: as a library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a third collection in,
I had specially made like a refrigerator
[SPEAKER_00]: with lights built into it, which,
and those, I gave them as little as an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour a day, broken up in 15 minutes so
that they never received really long
[SPEAKER_00]: periods of dark at any one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just met a guy in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of my research comes from old,
old school growers in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said the same thing Sam was
saying as far as keeping the plants in
[SPEAKER_07]: veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: The guy came here recently and did a
greenhouse tour and he goes, no,
[SPEAKER_07]: I only have my light on in the middle of
the night for one hour in the winter time
[SPEAKER_07]: to keep them in veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought one hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, to save on generator and
power and all these things that people
[SPEAKER_07]: deal with, they can't use all this
electricity or access to it maybe in the
[SPEAKER_07]: middle of the night, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when he told me that in the veg period,
he, that he only uses the light for one
[SPEAKER_07]: hour in the middle of the night,
I was just like, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I'm starting to hear a little bit,
some pieces of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course now Sam is kind of
confirming that whole thing too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I'm going to try it,
you know, like, I think it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to try the sexing stuff and play
around with all those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like doing experiments and, and,
another good thing to remind yourself is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is lots of lumens, less time, like an
hour, but less lumens, maybe two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: To prevent flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: To prevent flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep that in mind as your sort of
recipe as you get into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, because.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just, I just want to make sure I'm
hearing you right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the thought process is don't,
don't give them a long period of no light.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're saying just break it up and you're,
you're turning the light on for 15 minutes
[SPEAKER_09]: every hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know Sam was saying that for his
library and part of his experimentation
[SPEAKER_07]: was to keep these plants from growing,
but to keep the library.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he said he dosed them in a couple
of times, 15 minutes at a time,
[SPEAKER_07]: if I heard you right, Sam, and then two
hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what he were just confirming was the
two hours for a low lumen light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had higher lumens, you could use
maybe less time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I think up in humble at
the guys using like a thousand watt light,
[SPEAKER_07]: just, I don't know how many or whatever,
but he does this burst of light for one
[SPEAKER_07]: hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm imagining if it's one hour,
working for him, it's probably a higher
[SPEAKER_07]: powered light.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should ask him, but that was how he
dealt with power concerns and generators
[SPEAKER_07]: and all these things, because he was
laughing at all the people that run
[SPEAKER_07]: generators for a few hours in the morning,
a few hours at night.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting fuel deliveries,
you know, every week out to their
[SPEAKER_07]: mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, you know, this dude's using the
light one time and, and his growth rate
[SPEAKER_07]: seems to be fine for what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause again, a lot of people are trying to
just keep their plants in check.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the sun does the production.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really important to keep everything
efficient.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we're talking about water and
now we're talking about ways to save
[SPEAKER_13]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the biggest thing about the
greenhouse is to try to become more
[SPEAKER_13]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, utilizing less light within
the greenhouse any way we can is super,
[SPEAKER_13]: super important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for that, Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was sweet.
[SPEAKER_13]: And create that conversation is important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, as far as, uh, you know, terpenes and
stuff, I mean, that's most definitely what
[SPEAKER_13]: we find.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we even try and really sell our,
our urban L possible, um, as greenhouse
[SPEAKER_13]: and we, we almost force it, you know,
and people are like, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: people are da da da da da.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_13]: People can learn now that this is how
sweet it looks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've even not sold it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody was going to sell it as
indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, well, it's not,
we're not going to sell it to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been important to us that really
beautiful and amazing, gorgeous,
[SPEAKER_03]: smelly flowers can be grown under the sun
in a light depth situation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even as far north in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not just a California thing or
Colorado or whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: It happens in Washington.
[SPEAKER_13]: It happens in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that we've even sent, uh, we had our
herb and we entered it into the high times
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis cup in Denver, the first legal,
the first legal year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was greenhouse weed from our place.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we kind of like use gnomes,
the gnome, express and, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_13]: and we got in the top 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: We came in eight out of like 450 of just
across the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't matter if it was organic,
indoor, outdoor.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just the Colorado time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And boom, there we were just up on the big
screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't even go to the, to the thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause we were just like, ah, you know,
we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we told Danny Danko that it was
BC greenhouse, he almost fell over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were walking around there for the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were kind of smoking a bunch of
people's weed and we were like,
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you know, there's not like actually
that much flavor in a bunch of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that, you know, we might
actually do pretty good.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we did, but, so I think hearing has
a lot to do with it too, but the
[SPEAKER_13]: greenhouse effect is an effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Flavors important to people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, let's, let's, you know,
I mean, that's, that's the main thing
[SPEAKER_07]: being able to open the bag and smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is one of the first things that
everybody looks for.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it doesn't have any smell, it's not
going to go much further.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, obviously curing is,
is a big part of the process for
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, you can see Jason in the
background there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like you got some shit drying
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, the whole curing process is
really crucial to retain those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, you're also growing up
North and the islands and kind of places
[SPEAKER_07]: that, you know, most people would probably
say that it would be difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, a lot of people laughed at
me when I talked about getting a
[SPEAKER_08]: greenhouse in Western Washington.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was, I was definitely the first customer
of Northern Lights Gardening, picking up a
[SPEAKER_08]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to, just to add to the terpene
conversation, you know, we, we won an
[SPEAKER_08]: award for, you know, highest level of
terpene.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was Limoni and our Hindu fish
at the Terp Fest.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, just, you know,
with the, with the market being so focused
[SPEAKER_08]: on THC and, you know, like if it doesn't
test over 20, most stores don't want it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now there's kind of a little bit of a
shift with people wanting to see terpene
[SPEAKER_08]: results on the test, on the label.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, I think as customers,
as people in general get more educated,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the terpene levels are really,
in a lot of cases, I think more important
[SPEAKER_08]: than THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: THC levels.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you don't really get that so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, strain and growing
methods at all plays into it no matter
[SPEAKER_08]: what environment you're in.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, but when it comes down to it,
sunshine, it just gives higher levels of
[SPEAKER_08]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_08]: The feel, the high, everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: The sunshine just, you know, coming from
so many years of indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then really I've got maybe three,
four years of greenhouse growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on my belt, I just, I love
smoking greenhouse weed more so.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just a, there's just a different
level to it, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know that also some of the
things that I learned from your project
[SPEAKER_07]: that other people can probably help with
is that, you know, you bought your
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse going into winter time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you technically didn't need your light
deprivation system.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you say- I ran it for the first six
months.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, and then when I got,
you know, enough bread together,
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought the greenhouse light depth system
separate and put that in for the summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a great way to look at
things because I try to, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: in some ways help people when they're
buying their greenhouses, because budgets
[SPEAKER_07]: are always a concern.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I always kind of reflect to your
story of, you know, applying the money
[SPEAKER_07]: when you needed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, there is light pollution
plans or a process is going into place.
[SPEAKER_07]: So not everybody can do what you did,
but you did have kind of a funny story.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you lit up your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the sheriff department.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the fire department, literally with
the bolt cutters ready to cut the chain on
[SPEAKER_08]: the gate.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the fire chief just happened to have
kids going to the same school.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we've always been open with
wherever kids have gone to school.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Hey, look, we grow weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if our kids smells like it,
you know, just know that it's not
[SPEAKER_08]: intentional, but yeah, that, that saved
our ass for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, but yeah, I mean, without the,
without the cover in the early morning or
[SPEAKER_08]: the, you know, the evening with a bunch of
HBS running, it's, yeah, you create quite
[SPEAKER_08]: the glow worm.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so the light deck curtain is a good
thing to have for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And not everybody can do that because of
the light pollution plans that are needed
[SPEAKER_07]: in places.
[SPEAKER_07]: But things like heat, if people are
setting up their greenhouses and they're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be running at springtime,
you definitely probably won't need the
[SPEAKER_07]: lights and the, and the heating system as
much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can save a couple bucks there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to, just to comment on that
specifically on some of these,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, dark days in the Northwest
winter, you know, raining sideways,
[SPEAKER_08]: gray skies for weeks on end, you know,
rather than running a heater, I'll close
[SPEAKER_08]: that curtain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's also known as an
energy curtain.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it keeps, it keeps the, the warmth in
the, in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, with just, you know,
15 gavitas running with, with that cover
[SPEAKER_08]: closed, I don't need, I don't need a
heater.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, at night I've got the dehus
running.
[SPEAKER_08]: So generally speaking, it, it stays right
where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you open up that curtain in the
same temperature, you know, it might drop
[SPEAKER_08]: down to 60.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas with the curtain closed and the
lights running, you know, right there at
[SPEAKER_08]: like 75, 76 degrees.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, there's a lot of advantages and a
lot of different things that you can do
[SPEAKER_08]: with the curtain, you know, without,
without the need to just block out light,
[SPEAKER_08]: but just keeping that environment,
keeping, keeping the temperatures and the
[SPEAKER_08]: humidity and everything dialed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to comment on, on the idea
of, of light pollution and, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: just bringing it back to being a
responsible farmer, you know, is we really
[SPEAKER_11]: do, we really should consider you know,
when we are running lights at night,
[SPEAKER_11]: the, the type of light pollution that
we're creating, you know, and in,
[SPEAKER_11]: in some counties and some municipalities,
it's actually part of regulations that you
[SPEAKER_11]: have to have a blackout system in order to
enclose that light.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because not only do the curtains keep the
light out, but they keep the light in as
[SPEAKER_11]: well.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as you said, Jason, like there's so
many more uses you can, you can utilize
[SPEAKER_11]: with that because a greenhouse itself
isn't necessarily, doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_11]: have our value to it, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, but, but when you utilize that
energy curtain, now not only are you
[SPEAKER_11]: cutting down the volume of air that you
need to, to warm or, or take some of the
[SPEAKER_11]: humidity out of, but, but you're creating
this, this, this energy conserving area,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that brings me to the conversation
of, you know, people that ask a lot,
[SPEAKER_11]: like, should I use a dual poly system with
air running through it?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, or some way to trap the heat in
the middle of it, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and really what we see is again,
you know, you shouldn't really be looking
[SPEAKER_11]: at your greenhouse skin as your,
as our value as your, as your ability to
[SPEAKER_11]: hold in heat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus what's happening, you know,
is as sunlight's coming through,
[SPEAKER_11]: if you've got say an 85% transmissive
cover that then has a gap of air and then
[SPEAKER_11]: another 85% transmissive cover.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you've got 85% of the light coming
through and then another 85% of that light
[SPEAKER_11]: coming through.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now there's a need to start turning on
lights because you're not getting the type
[SPEAKER_11]: of lumens that you need.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's, you know, it can be a really,
uh, fighting against the flow on that
[SPEAKER_11]: level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus in the summertime, if you have that,
that, um, dual system as well,
[SPEAKER_11]: now you've got an area that's trapping
heat and all you're trying to do is get
[SPEAKER_11]: rid of heat, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, yeah, the, the curtains can be
used on, on so many levels.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried to double cover on a, on a
different system, like just a hoop house.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the winter time, you know,
it does, it does trap heat and it does
[SPEAKER_08]: create, you know, a little bit more
efficient running at the expense of
[SPEAKER_08]: needing to run more lights because yeah,
now you're down to like 70% versus versus
[SPEAKER_08]: just 85%.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, there's pluses and minuses for,
you know, all these different systems for
[SPEAKER_08]: sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you use a lumen meter at all to,
to judge whether your plants are getting
[SPEAKER_13]: the kind of growth rate that you're
looking for in your greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I do, I do use a lumen meter,
but not necessarily, um, for that in
[SPEAKER_08]: particular.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I take what I can get the lumen
meter though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would, I would run around and,
um, you know, at zero lumens there's,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's enough light for humans to see,
but you know, not necessarily for plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would use that lumen meter as kind of
a, you know, a meter for when do I pull my
[SPEAKER_08]: tarps at night?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and that's a good point too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have an app on your phone now
called light meter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the light meter app is pretty handy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when I find out if it's dark or
not.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people wonder or try to say,
Oh, you got to be there exactly the same
[SPEAKER_07]: time every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't have a pinhole of light leak.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't, it's just, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so unforgiving and your plants
are going to herm and all hell.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, no, you can be late.
[SPEAKER_07]: I skipped five days one time, not in a
row, but five days over the course of a
[SPEAKER_07]: whole round.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had lots of light leaks over time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made sure the light meter said zero.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it says zero, you're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm not advocating being lazy and
having tons of light leaks and that kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of shit, but I've definitely pushed the
limit to really see, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: where the variances are sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, I think the plants are pretty
dang forgiving.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of the myths and the things that
we are afraid of in cannabis come from
[SPEAKER_07]: indoor technology.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that isn't a slight indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just when there's a light leak,
we don't find it for a week or three.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't, you know, it's just,
it's a little different in light depth
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets dark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mother nature is on your side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And something that we noticed too,
is that we never had any herming or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything like that, or even Fox tanning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have any problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always had like, you know, light leaks
and all different kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we maybe weren't always on time,
just the way that the day was going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we started putting in like some
equatorial land races and some of the old
[SPEAKER_03]: school land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we really started noticing that
if there was even a teeny tiny light leak
[SPEAKER_03]: in there, that those ones were really
going to go off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were having herming like
immediately.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had an Acapulco gold in particular that
was just getting towards the end of its
[SPEAKER_13]: flower and then just totally reveged its
flower bud and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was just a little bit of light that
really kind of triggered it to make that
[SPEAKER_13]: happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We noticed that with all of our land race
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are doing genetics, you know,
it probably is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really learning about having it
totally tight, but most of the time it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't really make a difference.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you got to be on it,
but it does help to have it black.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: That brings up a good point that you know,
I've had my own experience, but I like to
[SPEAKER_11]: hear everybody else's feedback as to
different strains for different cycles in
[SPEAKER_11]: the year.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we talk about, you know,
three cycles in a depth house or five
[SPEAKER_11]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had my own experience where I can see
a variance in what genetics to use in each
[SPEAKER_11]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody else like to comment on that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have to say coming from an indoor
grower background.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I would never skip a beat.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like you pull the room down,
you clean it, you stock it right back up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you've got a good, if you got a
good, you know, seven and a half to eight
[SPEAKER_08]: week plant, you know, there's really no
reason in indoor or greenhouse that you
[SPEAKER_08]: shouldn't be able to get six crops a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if you're, if you're running
something that's, you can pull down in 49
[SPEAKER_08]: days.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you could technically squeeze in
seven.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if, you know, if you're on it,
there's no lag time, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: at least.
[SPEAKER_07]: So are you saying you officially pull six
a year right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Every year.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I, you know, I, I look at it,
I look at it like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: If, if you have, you know, if you have 56
days in a cycle, if you're going to pull
[SPEAKER_08]: down, you know, let's say you're pulling
down $30,000 every, every 56 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, 56 days divided by $30,000 is,
you know, whatever it is, I can't add,
[SPEAKER_08]: but, but for every day that you're down
and you're not up and running,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, you, you could consider that a
loss.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas if you're, if you're really
efficient and you really stay on your,
[SPEAKER_08]: on your cycle, I mean, there's,
there's no reason to not get six.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we're all looking at all of these
new regulations and taxes and everything,
[SPEAKER_08]: we have to be smart with our money.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to be smart with our time.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to be efficient.
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise we're going to get kicked out of
the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jonathan, to answer your question,
you know, I absolutely feel like genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: is paramount to running, you know,
multiple cycles, you know, really looking
[SPEAKER_03]: into what works in a cold, colder weather
system, what works better in a damper
[SPEAKER_03]: cycle, because with greenhouses and you're
lowering your costs, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're not putting up all those fans
and everything, you really can work with
[SPEAKER_03]: your genetics during the seasonal times.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, the model of getting as
many out of a season, I totally understand
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it makes all the sense in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are some formats that you can
use to just take some time off,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and get like really good
seasons, you know, throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, you know, utilize your crew and
rejuvenate yourself a little bit like
[SPEAKER_13]: that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I mean, I'm not saying that we're not
at all saying that as I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to what you said, but yeah,
I think Josh is saying that those,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we have gone in and done some
consulting with a lot of farms and we have
[SPEAKER_03]: really run those numbers and people are
really trying to push, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the five cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you start running the
numbers and the outtake and the heat,
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe the air conditioning that it
takes to run those, it's almost better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is that actually has been better
for some of them to take off one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: cycles, because they've just realized that
their output is a lot more than what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're getting out of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one other factor and like different
and like in the state of Oregon,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's just there's a huge over for
production.
[SPEAKER_13]: So just utilizing your time, you know,
in a way that makes sense is a big thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'd also be interested to hear what
people are doing for their soils,
[SPEAKER_13]: if they're testing their soils or doing
ways of finding their soils to keep their
[SPEAKER_13]: plants efficient and their greenhouses
efficient in their grass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone soil test?
[SPEAKER_10]: We soil test.
[SPEAKER_10]: I soil test too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, I'll go after you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we soil test.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's probably one of the best things we
could have done for our farm.
[SPEAKER_14]: We worked the soil two years and we used
dirty business soil located in Arcata,
[SPEAKER_14]: California.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just, the knowledge that came from
us being on an old floodplain was
[SPEAKER_14]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_14]: The ground is perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when I hear you guys talking about,
oh, the bags or whatever, I think it's
[SPEAKER_14]: sufficient to plant into the ground.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Mike is not back yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess I still have the stage,
but while I'm here, if anyone would like
[SPEAKER_14]: to do a video with the girl sisters,
we want to hang out with you guys more.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how long the church goes
today, but there's definitely topics that
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been writing down and I would love to
pick your brains later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm sure most people are available
one form or another.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I mean, I definitely would love
to say hello when I come up North on my
[SPEAKER_07]: next visit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a spare bedroom.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that sounds weird, but just go in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, lots of people up in Humboldt have
guest quarters because it's not the type
[SPEAKER_07]: of area you go to back in the day and
just, you know, hotels weren't always
[SPEAKER_07]: easily accessible unless you were in
Arcata.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam had another thing you wanted to share
about talking about lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what we found is that
absolutely need lots of lumens to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass and vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has flowered halfway or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much all it's going to do then
is fill out the flowers and maybe add a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of weight from resin and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found lower light levels I'm talking
about from the sun or from artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: lights actually produce superior product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what I found is that the high
temperatures associated with flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: really high temperatures, it's not really
positive because it has a tendency to
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporize terpenes right on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lower temperatures, a little bit lower
lumens, I found produce superior product.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, that's one of the reasons
that we spend a lot of time trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: lower plant temperatures because lowering
the air temperature is a lot harder to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so our work has been, you know,
in a hundred degree day trying to get
[SPEAKER_07]: plant temperatures down into the high 80s
if possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it works and the soil temps stay down
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, part of that is what
we're seeing with the higher terpene
[SPEAKER_07]: production coming up because a lot of
these places, like I said, are really high
[SPEAKER_07]: in the air temperature, but luckily for
us, plants are like people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We sweat, plants sweat.
[SPEAKER_07]: So put me in front of a fan.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to cool down and not sweat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put a fan in front of a plant and it's
going to avoid it from sweating and even
[SPEAKER_07]: start to cool it down because it's
evaporative itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's where I see a lot of the
terpene and even higher THC productions
[SPEAKER_07]: is, yes, softer light like Sam was saying,
cooler, especially leaf surface
[SPEAKER_07]: temperature over time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we saw at the soil class or the
regenerative class I did seminar with
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragonfly up in Portland last week was a
guy that during one of the discussions
[SPEAKER_07]: talked about THC because a lot of people
in certain books and things have written
[SPEAKER_07]: about, you know, higher THC is high
associated with higher UV.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we see is that greenhouse covers
in general and even with glass green,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, glass being a cover,
UVs can be blocked.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why people end up getting a lot
of PM in their greenhouses versus outdoor
[SPEAKER_07]: plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Outdoor plants won't get PM as easy,
but greenhouse does.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that has a lot to do with the UVB.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if people try to associate higher
THC with UV, I'm starting to see that
[SPEAKER_07]: that's not necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what brings it up also in that class
or the seminar was a guy was doing testing
[SPEAKER_07]: with LED lights and there was an LED light
he said that put off a higher UVB.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it encouraged a higher leaf surface
temperature and they actually lost 2% THC
[SPEAKER_07]: through testing the lights and having
those UVBs tell them that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it kind of associates a lot with the
sun and how we can soften the light to
[SPEAKER_07]: encourage higher THC and terpene profiles
in these plants and it can be done.
[SPEAKER_07]: And going back to what Jonathan was saying
about picking the right genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if this has to do with,
you know, shitty clones over the course of
[SPEAKER_07]: time, because I was in some massive
greenhouses down in Southern California
[SPEAKER_07]: and there was an acre or two that had just
tons of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you walk through the greenhouse,
you can clearly see that certain varieties
[SPEAKER_07]: did really well versus the other
varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it was clear for me is like,
why grow these if you can just grow those?
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it solves the problem for
that area.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, maybe they had shitty moms
and the clones were shitty.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it literally looked like it had a lot
to do with the selective cultivars that
[SPEAKER_07]: they were trying to deal with at that time
in that particular area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because again, people are getting existing
greenhouses now and so they might not have
[SPEAKER_07]: all the options that we talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so how can we work with existing
systems to make them work smarter,
[SPEAKER_07]: not harder?
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, you know, I was thinking that
it's really important for people to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: small area of their farm or their
greenhouse for research and development.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, running numbers and looking at
how we need to save money, running a
[SPEAKER_03]: little area of research and development
for genetics is really becoming absolutely
[SPEAKER_03]: imperative.
[SPEAKER_03]: What works in your area and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a shout out to Bogside Botanicals and
Maine, they've been running a few
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouses of ours and they do what they
called snow depths on their hashtags.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know they've done a lot of research
with small hoops and even garage tents and
[SPEAKER_07]: things that we heard earlier from some
panelists.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, I mean, you can do a lot in
a short amount of time if you just do a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit of testing and then,
you know, quantify that you can do it and
[SPEAKER_07]: then make the leap.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, like I said before, a lot of the
greenhouses and the things that we see are
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty cookie cutter from state to state,
coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just having that flexibility to be
able to open or close these greenhouses
[SPEAKER_07]: to, you know, turn them on or off
basically for a lack of better words and
[SPEAKER_07]: support cannabis, not fight mother nature
to support cannabis, but truly support it
[SPEAKER_07]: in all ways possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we do got to fight mother nature
because there's no sun and it's dark and
[SPEAKER_07]: it's freezing cold outside of obviously we
want to add heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, we want to be practical in
all these aspects of how we apply these
[SPEAKER_07]: systems.
[SPEAKER_13]: And are you seeing people using shade
cloths in the heat of the day and like for
[SPEAKER_13]: two hours say or something like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in some cases, I see people using them
in inconsistent ways or maybe not totally
[SPEAKER_07]: in the correct manner.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a point of no return.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you can pull a shade cloth where
it's too late and you're actually going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be retaining energy rather than helping
cool the leaf surfaces and things like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been working with a lot of the shade
screen or now they call them climate
[SPEAKER_07]: screens now because originally they were
shade screens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the companies we work with create a
climate screen that can be used in various
[SPEAKER_07]: capacities and different, you know,
there's a whole book of samples that I
[SPEAKER_07]: have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so depending on where you are and what
you're doing, you know, we can select the
[SPEAKER_07]: proper energy slash shade curtain.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, again, the grower has to
use all these things at the right time and
[SPEAKER_07]: appropriately so that these things work
smarter for you and not harder basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of the name of the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can easily take the word green right
out of greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was wondering if we if anyone wanted to
talk about like pests in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_13]: and stuff, because we've utilized our
greenhouse to get rid of pests.
[SPEAKER_13]: And has anyone else used that?
[SPEAKER_13]: And what do they do for that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think that's a really big issue
in growing these days is how to have a
[SPEAKER_13]: greenhouse or how to go long term with
pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And pest and fungal management.
[SPEAKER_03]: So both of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, JD, why don't we hear from you a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you have to deal with since you
enter all these events and all this
[SPEAKER_07]: scrutinized testing that you've gone
through in California?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you spray and deal battle pests and
things?
[SPEAKER_12]: We spray when we need to kind of as a last
resort.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've used heat a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll turn off the vents and on the sealed
greenhouse and I could run the heat up
[SPEAKER_12]: really hot.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I run it up over maybe like 110,
115 degrees, it seems like it'll like
[SPEAKER_12]: start eliminating all a lot of the
pathogens, you know, like getting rid of a
[SPEAKER_12]: lot of pests.
[SPEAKER_12]: We hear, you know, in this area,
it'll be 110 degrees outside for three or
[SPEAKER_12]: four days running.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if you use four or five hours a day
and let it spike up up into the 120,
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we've had a really it seems to
purge everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here like a lot of commercial
nurseries doing that, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like with some of their indoor
plants, it's like a lot easier and more
[SPEAKER_12]: efficient than spraying.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's one of the things that the
greenhouse will help with.
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you spray with?
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to spray with compost tea,
like doing foliar teas, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: and building up that like natural barrier
on the plants so that they have the
[SPEAKER_12]: immunity to fight it off.
[SPEAKER_12]: The idea is to not have to get into a
battle with anything, which is to try to
[SPEAKER_12]: keep it in balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am also heating up the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really finding we're doing a
tremendous amount of research right now on
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogens of both fungal and also pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're finding that that one hundred
and twenty three degrees at leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature, not just one hundred and
twenty degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is like going on in the outside,
you know, really having a temperature
[SPEAKER_03]: gauge is absolutely imperative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being inside of the greenhouses when
you're raising it to one hundred and
[SPEAKER_03]: twenty and also absolutely giving them
just like when you go into the sauna,
[SPEAKER_03]: you bring all of your teas and your waters
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really have to drench those soils and
get a really beautiful tea on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's easy to uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some nice natural plant electrolytes
and get it up to one hundred and twenty
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're noticing that pathogens die at
one hundred and twenty degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the a lot of the beneficials
will thrive and the plant thrives at one
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred and twenty degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are just so thankful, you know,
maybe over the last 10 years realizing
[SPEAKER_03]: about pest and fungal management.
[SPEAKER_13]: The leaves really going up and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we hit a threshold where they
started to peel a little bit, like get a
[SPEAKER_13]: little bit too hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we open the sides.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to be really careful with opening
in the sides when you do a heat treatment,
[SPEAKER_13]: because if a wind hits it or a direct sun,
it can almost like burn the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes the leaf temperature just that
higher when you heat your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_13]: You really have to kind of open it slow
and just let the plant just kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: reacclimate and rebreathe and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just want to say aphids are a new
pest that are becoming a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're kind of like they're kind of
different.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they went away after many hours of
super hot heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys ever see the ants bring the
aphids onto your plants so they could milk
[SPEAKER_04]: them for their little sugar juices?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you look at, you know,
I've gone into the brain of the aphid this
[SPEAKER_03]: last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've really taken a lot of time to learn
about aphids and what they do and what is
[SPEAKER_03]: happening now on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you really look at an aphid,
it's an amazing macro food for almost
[SPEAKER_03]: every single other species.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a scrumptious little body.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so scrumptious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has delicious little sugars and
carbohydrates in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I even ate one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, OK, you know, I'm really going
to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: They taste just like cannabis juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're realizing that there's a
homeopathic dose.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what's there, but we're
going to find out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're really delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they really make an amazing food for
other animals and other life forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe they're coming out for that
reason.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yellow jackets eat them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, you know, it's important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Broad mites.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we just want to really encourage
predator mites from the nursery all the
[SPEAKER_13]: way through, because, you know,
sprays are harder and harder to use,
[SPEAKER_13]: even compost sprays.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 120 degrees definitely will kill your
predators as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your predator mites will not kill
ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other, you know, hard exoskeleton
creatures have no problem with that much
[SPEAKER_03]: of a heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the small mites definitely die.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's interesting about ice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there something to say about that?
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just commenting that using ice water
sprays on the plants will, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: because you'll you'll notice mites and
russets and broad mites and all that stuff
[SPEAKER_12]: as they take off.
[SPEAKER_12]: They really thrive at those higher
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_12]: So especially with outdoor growing and,
you know, even in people's greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_12]: you'll see that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So start to spread.
[SPEAKER_12]: But ice water will slow the cycle down for
like two or three, you know, instead of it
[SPEAKER_12]: being like a duplication every like three
days or you can stretch that out to like
[SPEAKER_12]: four or five and really slow down their
their duplication to give you time to get
[SPEAKER_12]: back on top of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bubble Man, I had a question for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It started out just kind of as a joke
right here on the side.
[SPEAKER_11]: But have you ever worked with the water
from your bubble hash and sprayed with
[SPEAKER_11]: that on your plants?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or have you used that to water into your
plants?
[SPEAKER_11]: And have you seen anything from that?
[SPEAKER_13]: He may have just actually left.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I wonder if Skunkman Sam had
anything to say about that, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we use our ice water hash for every
single feeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we actually are realizing that
we're making hash more for the nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: of our plants and to get like the leftover
material into our soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the hash is now a secondary
product for us.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're putting together our nursery soil
right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we want to spin some hash up so that we
can utilize the leaf in our soil mix.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we have a hundred and fifty
gallon tank that has a hose coming out of
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So all the water comes out of it and goes
into a hundred and fifty gallon tank.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we gravity feed all that water
into our different greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we just accumulate the terpene water in
our beds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, if you're making ice water
hash, it's not so great to do ice water
[SPEAKER_03]: hash necessarily in the middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you are spinning something inside
and you can spray it, russet mites
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely do not like that cold water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that idea, Jonathan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just as another sort of thought with
greenhouses and pest control, just keeping
[SPEAKER_08]: things kind of cold in the winter,
you know, if there's any sort of issues or
[SPEAKER_08]: you see anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just turning the heater up and letting
things kind of get a little bit colder
[SPEAKER_08]: than normal, at least in veg.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about more so.
[SPEAKER_08]: But and then it just gives you kind of a
chance to get really on top of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they just don't, bugs just don't
multiply as readily when it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_08]: chillier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's another reason that we like
promote the radiant heating, because when
[SPEAKER_07]: you heat the soil and heat the roots and
heat the plant itself, the air temp can
[SPEAKER_07]: stay kind of lower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you experience that with your
geothermal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your prohibition vault is actually your
geothermal heating system for your
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse inadvertently.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're able to keep those air temps
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, that's really a benefit in the
wintertime, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, yeah, using the environment to
do things to mitigate bugs is definitely a
[SPEAKER_07]: good way to make the green in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, bubble man, you dropped off for
a second there, but I wanted to ask you,
[SPEAKER_11]: have you utilized the spent water from
making bubble with all of the turps and
[SPEAKER_11]: all of the everything that's inside of
that to use as an effective foliar or
[SPEAKER_11]: drench?
[SPEAKER_04]: We definitely played around in the early
days, but never really noticed anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've my experiments were more
hash focused than grow focused.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to be lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, shout out to Ron Hickey,
my grow mentor from back in the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: who just always made it seem like a simple
thing to produce full melt resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I never grew on a huge, huge scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, 20 lights was about where I
maxed out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mostly really did indoor with a
little bit of outdoor sort of on my deck
[SPEAKER_04]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still do have the dream of getting the
forever flowering greenhouse behind my
[SPEAKER_04]: house.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be 2018 or 2019 for certain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not too much experiments other than,
you know, a little bit of a foliar feed
[SPEAKER_04]: and putting it right back into the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it definitely didn't seem to do
negative.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you guys smoking on over there in
Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hitting some pure artesian rosin from
Quebec.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little Quebec rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, we're hitting some local
Jamaican flavors as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always come and made bubble hash over
the years, but rosin is just such a quick
[SPEAKER_04]: and easy thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when you have the Sasquatch
rosin press here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can just crush out a half pound in no
time and make some nice resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have some, you know, the pineapple
skunk or whatever they call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The classic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything skunk in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you smoking on, Dragonfly?
[SPEAKER_13]: We have this homesteader strain that we've
crossed our Temple Spice with our Zellie's
[SPEAKER_13]: gift.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just got this really beautiful
flavor to it that has some of the
[SPEAKER_13]: Jacquerier super lemon hazelnuts in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that original afghus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes from a father of our F who knows
how many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many, many, many years that we've been
working with a particular strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got this one that we're calling
the homesteader because it's so sweet.
[SPEAKER_13]: And because we used our hash water on it,
it's on our homestead.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, I just want to say one thing
is that when we do use our hash water,
[SPEAKER_13]: that water, it doesn't really last very
long.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also the leaf doesn't last very long
when it gets spun up, because I don't know
[SPEAKER_13]: if spin is a word, but spun up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It tends to have a little bit of,
you know, the ability to break down quick.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, we put it right into our
soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, our son and our family is up at
home right now doing that right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to the crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, guys, for running that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're putting it right into the soil so
that it doesn't create a breakdown and it
[SPEAKER_13]: doesn't get anaerobic because the water on
the leaf, you know, can create an
[SPEAKER_13]: anaerobic thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll make bokashi in it by adding dry
material to it to make sure that it
[SPEAKER_13]: doesn't get too wet and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyway, utilizing it fresh is key,
and the water, you know, just accumulates
[SPEAKER_13]: in the soil nicely.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you smoking on, Farmer Tom?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your go-to throughout the day?
[SPEAKER_13]: Muted.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who, I'm muted?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's Tom.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're smoking, I'm smoking black rec,
which is black Durbin mixed with train rec
[SPEAKER_01]: and a mix with some amnesia haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're liking here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about you, Siobhan?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you smoking on over there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Bless Coast.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bless Coast OG.
[SPEAKER_14]: Simply, simply OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about you, JD?
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the one I rolled up for the show,
I've got a Lemon Banana Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just came out of our winter round.
[SPEAKER_12]: It came out really nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Super sweet and creamy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good thing for I can still stay focused on
the show, not get too blasted.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since you're in the area,
[SPEAKER_07]: when I was at the Golden Tarp,
I was lucky enough to do some judging and
[SPEAKER_07]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I was able to know which flower
was yours once they announced the winners
[SPEAKER_07]: because they let us know the number.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was definitely, I think,
a landslide at the judges area.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a clear, like, it was pretty easy
to choose your flower over some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: rest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of people in those light dip
competitions, unfortunately, enter a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of premature herb is what I saw.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a lot more premature weed than I
normally am used to seeing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Jason, what are you smoking on over
there?
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite is this cherry pie that got
going.
[SPEAKER_08]: But a couple of cuts I got from friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stunky.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's killer.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about you, Jonathan?
[SPEAKER_07]: You smoking on anything over there?
[SPEAKER_11]: Super silver haze all the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have any LSD going on over there
because that was good for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about Mike?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you got in Colorado there?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that is the strain, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, the strain LSD, Jonathan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one of our pins.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on pins in Colorado with Flav.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a leaf, Flav?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a CBD strain that we did,
Valentine X.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is what I managed to get in my
bag before we took off.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's killer.
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes the slopes much nicer.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to bring it back to greenhouse
cultivation, if I can for a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a couple questions I'd like to just
throw out to the group.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think a lot of methodologies of
cultivation are changing right now because
[SPEAKER_11]: of the removal of the plant count.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that ruled so much of what people
were doing for so long, and people didn't
[SPEAKER_11]: want to get above 99 plants on their
property.
[SPEAKER_11]: But now that we removed that, a lot of
people are going with smaller plants and
[SPEAKER_11]: higher plant counts.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we talk about efficiency,
and of course, there's so many ways to
[SPEAKER_11]: look at it, really.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people are just focused on
efficiency, which have a lot of,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's very practical in the regulated
market.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sam was talking about growing big
plants more for genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: And breeding and such.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what I'm seeing too is a big
movement into rolling benches so that you
[SPEAKER_11]: can really utilize your footprint and have
as much of your space being grown with as
[SPEAKER_11]: little amount of walkways going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so some people are going with really
small plants, like five to seven gallon
[SPEAKER_11]: plants, and then just able to just grow
really short plants that are about 18
[SPEAKER_11]: inches, two feet tops.
[SPEAKER_11]: At the end, with a whole lot less labor
that goes into it, a whole lot less amount
[SPEAKER_11]: of time for, again, any molds,
mildews, pests, or diseases to move in.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so wondering what everybody here on
the call is having success with in the
[SPEAKER_11]: sense of, are you moving to higher plant
counts, smaller plants?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you growing larger plants inside of a
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_11]: And going in that direction, and maybe
vegging them somewhere else and getting
[SPEAKER_11]: them in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, what's your guys' experience out
there?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're definitely doing higher plant counts
than we were in the past, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that we don't really have to worry
about the quote unquote 99 rule for a
[SPEAKER_09]: handful of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that, especially with our full
term stuff that we do, we've got some
[SPEAKER_09]: gardens off to the sides of the
greenhouses and tending to a 16 foot tall
[SPEAKER_09]: outdoor plant is super labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're trying to keep everything
that's just same height as us.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do more plants than a nice,
let's watch you hit that thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do more plants in the garden than we
did in the past.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's mainly for two different reasons.
[SPEAKER_09]: The one thing being that it's easier when
it comes to labor, I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other is just I personally
feel that younger plants, when you have
[SPEAKER_09]: these big, gigantic, tall plants,
we kind of see that there's, we run into
[SPEAKER_09]: more problems with molds and stuff at the
end of the year than we do with smaller
[SPEAKER_09]: plants that aren't so thick and in the bud
setting.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in our depots, yeah, we're
definitely doing sea of green.
[SPEAKER_09]: Still doing, we're doing beds in all of
our depots, even in our forever flowering
[SPEAKER_09]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just the way, it's my personal,
I like.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like moving a bunch of pots around
and pulling soil in and out of that
[SPEAKER_09]: greenhouse all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: That might change as we expand.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we do do one of these big greenhouse
facilities, I might change my thinking on
[SPEAKER_09]: that just being, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so more plants and smaller plants is
definitely what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Micah, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just touched on something that's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking about earlier R&D and bigger
plants do have more susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely noticing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really awesome to grow them out
because they are these beautiful,
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing sentient beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And who doesn't love to grow big plants?
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have just four of those tall ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we use that for our research and
development.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what grows well around our areas,
we're going to grow those plants all the
[SPEAKER_03]: way out and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to find out how they're
doing in the environment to really work
[SPEAKER_03]: with what plants we're going to run for
the next year, what we're going to seed
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So picking our genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there is different expressions that
come from the bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that for us, we'll always keep
a greenhouse for the big plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that different regulations make
people grow differently in California.
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes sense to have 20 pounds at a time
for testing and everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when it comes to testing, that's a
cost and everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: So sometimes that's why clones are doing
batches of different smaller plants and
bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big batches can make a lot of sense for
testing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're also doing now is we're
actually swapping out our greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one half of the greenhouse is for these
huge, large plants that we're utilizing
[SPEAKER_03]: research and development in one area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're doing two different cycles
in the other side of the greenhouse in a
[SPEAKER_03]: sea of green.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's been really fun to sort of swap
it around.
[SPEAKER_14]: Going back to pest, having the smaller
plants, we were able to handle them more
[SPEAKER_14]: and keep them cleaner and move through
them quicker.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the depth worked.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that has a lot to do with the
plants just being in a more vigorous
[SPEAKER_13]: state.
[SPEAKER_13]: And especially if you're in beds and if
you have pots, if your plants have been in
[SPEAKER_13]: pots for a long time and their roots are
bound, they're going to be more
[SPEAKER_13]: susceptible towards pests.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a lot of soil tests that can
prove that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And bigger people need more calories.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no different for plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have larger people, larger
plants, they need more calories.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're definitely going to be uptaking so
much more from your soil as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really good to rate out,
are your plants producing more flowers in
[SPEAKER_03]: the end or is the sea of green producing
more flowers in the end?
[SPEAKER_13]: And the smaller plants, usually those
roots are in a more vigorous growth state
[SPEAKER_13]: as they're growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So their flowers are more healthy in that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam just had mentioned something off
camera here when we were on mute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to mention it, Sam?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about the size of the resin blends
versus the size of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to mention that when I grew
the identical clone, big, small,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in vitro so that the flowered off
plant was only maybe an inch or two tall
[SPEAKER_00]: when it was completely flowered in agar
agar, in vitro, in a test tube,
[SPEAKER_00]: the resin is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin individual resin heads on that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow it two, three feet tall,
like you're talking about for sea green or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, the resin is quite a bit
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I grew my same clone and it was
12 feet tall, the resin was again,
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's important to me.
[SPEAKER_13]: We missed that last that last little part,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the the last little part was that if
your plant is 12 feet tall and you
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered off and then you collect the
resin from that, it's again a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger than the three foot plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each individual resin head is a little bit
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for hash makers, that's important.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where we don't want to outsmart
ourselves and having a place for the
[SPEAKER_13]: bigger plants and the bigger expression,
really.
[SPEAKER_13]: Depending on what you're growing the
plants for can make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are going to bring in one
particular strain from somebody that's
[SPEAKER_03]: selling clones or something, we do really
suggest to grow it out really big.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's going to be something that you're
going to run and you're going to do a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole lot or a whole greenhouse or several
greenhouses of, it's good to see its full
[SPEAKER_03]: expression all the way through to see what
kind of pests or what kind of fungi that
[SPEAKER_03]: it gets.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting listening to all the
different perspectives, especially the
[SPEAKER_08]: resin head size.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done I've done rooms with 24 plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done rooms with 240 plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the yield wise, you know, it can be
very similar.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only difference being the time that
you've got to spend in veg.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, if you're spending
different or if you're vegging in a
[SPEAKER_08]: different area, you know, it doesn't
necessarily affect the flowering area.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's you know, the regulations and the
plant numbers going away.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, up here in Washington,
they said we could, you know, medical,
[SPEAKER_08]: we could grow 45 plants, but they never
said how big they could be.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I always did really big
plants and, you know, fill the thousand
[SPEAKER_08]: square feet or 200 square feet with that
same number.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I like growing big plants in up here
in Washington.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the best, but, you know,
in a light depth, it works.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it the same results can be
achieved, you know, with different number
[SPEAKER_08]: of plants, different sizes, but the whole
resin head size.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a cool thing to think about,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I mean, one of the things
that we kind of went by to create a metric
[SPEAKER_07]: that Jonathan, you know, we kind of came
up with, I think through collectively
[SPEAKER_07]: responses from our the people we worked
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically was that in a thousand square
feet, we would say the minimum average
[SPEAKER_07]: harvest should be 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, we have people up north
that are exceeding that number.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have some people, most people
actually under that number.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know in Colorado, there's a
couple of facilities that are supposedly
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty good that are running at 38 pounds
per thousand square feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, originally people went
by, you know, how many pounds per light,
[SPEAKER_07]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is kind of a popular way, I think now in
the indoor category.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, like the greenhouse on our
property here, it's kind of back there,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's a 24 by 60 and it's 1440 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we say the minimum average harvest out
of that would be 75 pounds per harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, we've seen up to 110,
but it all does come down to variety.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now with this plant count and going
into rolling benches and smaller plants
[SPEAKER_07]: and things like that, I'm kind of anxious
to see where these numbers are going to
[SPEAKER_07]: go, if they kind of stay the same,
if they increase or what.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, we're still trying to do
some fact finding on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got another question to throw out to
people, because this is something,
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah, beautiful, but up there in BC,
you guys, you guys are giving love to the
[SPEAKER_11]: Beasters.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you're redeeming yourselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think all BC should give love
to Kelly and Josh, because they're
[SPEAKER_11]: redeeming the Beasters up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take that.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of good family up in British
Columbia doing some good strains.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will say this about the Beasters.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Beasters came in not far after the
community of Vietnamese people started
[SPEAKER_04]: growing cannabis, but it actually came in
a little bit before.
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost commercially really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the real problem in the beginning from
BC was the integrity of the bio.
[SPEAKER_04]: The integrity of the buyer is he who was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_13]: I really wish we could we could listen to
him.
[SPEAKER_13]: Marcus, we we probably know what he'll
say, which is the integrity of the buyer
[SPEAKER_13]: really affected the grower.
[SPEAKER_13]: So as people moved indoors, you know,
the only strain that they could grow was
[SPEAKER_13]: the strain that the buyer was going to buy
from them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was no room for creativity and
there was no room for anything,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was organized crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that time, so that was the reason why
the Beasters started to become,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, gave a name for itself was
really because, you know, then the
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers didn't even really realize what
a real flower looked like outside of what
[SPEAKER_03]: the buyer was buying.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were going we were getting a lot of
BC coming down and then sprayed with
[SPEAKER_11]: formaldehyde so that they could ship it
wetter, you know, and when you asked why
[SPEAKER_11]: it wasn't cured or dried, the response
that I would get would be because you get
[SPEAKER_11]: more weight when it's wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, we were bringing down any of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that wasn't us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there would be the thing of
everyone seeing it before they brought it
[SPEAKER_13]: down and da da da da.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there was a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you were you were getting formaldehyde
weed from the north and then paraquat weed
[SPEAKER_13]: up from Mexico from the south.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And give thanks for the NorCal Hills
because they saved the day and came in,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, all the Emerald Triangle and up
in the Sierras came in and saved us at
[SPEAKER_11]: that point.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the islands of British Columbia and
out in the Kootenays have, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: really, really crucial families.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll give thanks to them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, enough love to all the ganja farmers
out there for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have a question, though, about CO2,
because it's getting mentioned a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's being brought up a lot right now and
getting introduced to greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_11]: And my biggest concern about in CO2
injection into greenhouses is how much of
[SPEAKER_11]: it's getting utilized.
[SPEAKER_11]: By the plants and how much is just being
blown into the environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, I just want to throw that one
out into the group again as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were going to talk about CO2
oil or something for a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: But CO2 injection into the air.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm seeing a lot of people messing with
that now, and it seems like you got to
[SPEAKER_07]: apply it just at the right time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, I mean, and and and have
the right tools to measure that to
[SPEAKER_07]: quantify I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's a new that's a hot new
topic basically is running the and I've
[SPEAKER_07]: seen a couple of different systems out
there that people are pushing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, we've always thought nature was
enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess maybe if they want more.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've seen that, too, lately,
a lot of bunch of friends that are talking
[SPEAKER_09]: about and I don't even know what the
product is, but they're talking about how
[SPEAKER_09]: they've got this CO2 product that where
the gas will actually stay in the
[SPEAKER_09]: greenhouse, even though the greenhouse is
rented, which makes I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, it makes no sense whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're claiming that that's what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's for the greenhouse grower and the
person trying to reduce energy costs and
[SPEAKER_09]: all these different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems counterintuitive to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant does just fine with with what
nature provides.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I hear guys want to do that and
some of the guys that I see build not
[SPEAKER_09]: these greenhouse facilities right now,
it's like they're trying to build their
[SPEAKER_09]: greenhouse like an indoor room.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they put they want CO2 injectors and
huge HVAC systems.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to me, it's the opposite direction of
of which way you should be going if you
[SPEAKER_09]: are going to be doing greenhouse farming.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cost of production definitely went up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gone one step further as far as
nature is concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're planting a lot of king
stropharia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we all know, you know, mushrooms
breathe in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And breathe out CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you have, you know, forever beds
that you're adding a tremendous amount of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, compost to or different type of
leaf material to, it's really imperative
[SPEAKER_03]: to have that quick breaker downer,
you know, the composter, which is the king
[SPEAKER_03]: stropharia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get three different things out of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It breaks down your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It lets off CO2 and it's delicious to eat.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a cold CO2.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not the kind of CO2 that goes up
into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the kind of CO2 that stays in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_13]: It stays more, you know, a ground level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will even stay right around the
soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also really smart to do log culture,
you know, underneath your ganja.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can be like a mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can just do a bunch of round logs
right next to each other, right at the
[SPEAKER_13]: base.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they'll grow medicinal mushrooms
and exhale CO2.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think if you're in a greenhouse,
you know, you're in nature and I think you
[SPEAKER_13]: should just enhance nature.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think if you're using a greenhouse
to, you know, be an outdoor grow room,
[SPEAKER_13]: then it can happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: It can happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And utilizing secondary products is so
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're all just pushing a lot of
cannabis, but to mix cannabis with
[SPEAKER_03]: different medicinal mushrooms is
absolutely key.
[SPEAKER_03]: These beautiful two adaptogens coming
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have so many different types of
secondary products that you can,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, be growing and getting out to
market or even getting to your
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And mushrooms is one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We like mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you spell that?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a, that's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to, I want to check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to chime in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's a King's Tropharia mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hate that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to try them in about regional
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble Mad touched on it when we first
started talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important because I came
from San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm originally a landscaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been planting things since I was
12 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each region's a little so much
different in a growing climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like in San Diego, we were growing,
we grew under shade cloth and thus I
[SPEAKER_01]: became a shade cloth band up here in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still use a light shade cloth through
the whole season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it benefits me with the passive
airflow that we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a really nice breeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts at three o'clock and stop to 11
o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes off the mouth of the Columbia and
we're in this, just this little sweet zone
[SPEAKER_01]: where it just blows through this nice cool
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really makes for a really good
growing thing, but it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it took years to, you know, develop the
style and get used to your place and what
[SPEAKER_01]: works best, you know, in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to use shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using shade cloth pretty much
the, not the whole season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're out September.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll pull it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get some extra light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, I travel a lot, so I can't really
light depth too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just, you know, as soon as the first
sign of any problems, that's when we pull
[SPEAKER_01]: really nothing, you know, goes full,
fully full turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: On our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyways, and sex go, we're huge fans
of trap plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we plant, we have continuous rounds of
green beans, and we also have a continuous
[SPEAKER_01]: rounds of eggplant because what we find is
the bugs will go to the trap plants before
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll go up into the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think just getting known in your,
in your region, we're in the Willamette
[SPEAKER_01]: Valley here in Vancouver, Washington,
the Portland area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're kind of like the north end of the
Willamette Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a really great greenhouse
growing environment here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are some of the things that,
you know, I've learned over the years and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, there you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's useful.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that cover crops can even become a
trap on accident, you know, for pests.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if people leave their cover crops too
long, or if it's, they have a pest
[SPEAKER_13]: outbreak, maybe, you know, it can go onto
the, to the cover crops.
[SPEAKER_13]: So just having biodiversity, I think,
we think having biodiversity and that's a
[SPEAKER_13]: big part of our pure certification and the
farms that we work with.
[SPEAKER_13]: And people can look up, you know,
the farms that we work with, and we have a
[SPEAKER_13]: new website called dempurefarms.com.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll just say that now because it's brand
new in the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's going to highlight the farms that
are doing interesting work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tremendous amounts of educational
practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really encourage just going back to
what everybody's saying, education.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's a really important to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, but yeah, you know, the, just having
diversity around your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_13]: even if it's flowers around your
greenhouse, maybe it's sunflowers,
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe it's marigolds, maybe it's
geraniums, because geraniums never get
[SPEAKER_13]: bugs on them.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's, it's just a, it's a whole
bunch of things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: make it important.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's things that we don't even know
about because we're just enhancing nature
[SPEAKER_13]: by having diversity around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another thing to add is that we're
realizing, you know, different types of
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've had a really horrible outbreak
of mites and you've had many years of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there's the geranyl,
you know, lemmonine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And linalool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are terpenes that really,
you know, pests do not like to be around
[SPEAKER_03]: at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really trying to find varieties that
contain those high terpene levels will be
[SPEAKER_03]: also really helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to also just remind people
this time of the year in the winter time,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you are growing in the, in the winter
time to maintain higher soil temps,
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen a couple of people noticing that
their plants aren't where they should be
[SPEAKER_07]: right now, as far as like flower
production.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and some people try to discuss,
you know, maybe it's the UV, maybe it's
[SPEAKER_07]: the temperature, maybe it's, you know,
the air temperature and some of these
[SPEAKER_07]: other factors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And nine times out of 10, a six inch soil
probe going into your soil will tell you
[SPEAKER_07]: how cold or warm your soil is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, the soil, when you're in
grow bags, I like to call growing in 30
[SPEAKER_07]: gallon or bigger grow bags, NorCal style,
because when there wasn't when there was
[SPEAKER_07]: plant counts, everybody wanted to grow the
biggest plant they possibly could,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they wanted to do light depth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the 30 to 45 gallon grow bag got
pretty popular.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you put that type of a grow bag
on the earth or even a grow bed,
[SPEAKER_07]: for that matter, the temperature of the
soil will fluctuate with the weather even.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when it's warm temperatures like this,
our soil temps obviously go up and when
[SPEAKER_07]: it's rainy, they go down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we have the cold snaps,
they go down tremendously.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we've seen that, you know,
or you guys, soil people have taught us
[SPEAKER_07]: that anything below 55 degrees,
we don't have nutrient exchange and good
[SPEAKER_07]: mobility for life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what I find in the winter time is
most soil temperatures are under 55
[SPEAKER_07]: degrees, whether they're in a container or
a bed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if you don't have soil temperatures
above 55 degrees, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_07]: trouble getting the same production or
quality of flour that you would normally
[SPEAKER_07]: get in the spring or the summertime.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, a six inch soil probe is
really easy to get on Amazon and have it
[SPEAKER_07]: sent to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also get the infrared thermometer so you
can point and shoot the surface temps to
[SPEAKER_07]: find out in the summertime how hot the
surface of the plant is, how hot the
[SPEAKER_07]: ground is, a bunch of different things,
you know, so you can really kind of get in
[SPEAKER_07]: tune.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because again, that temp and humidity
thermostat that we normally would go to in
[SPEAKER_07]: a grow room or even a greenhouse
controller doesn't really tell us
[SPEAKER_07]: everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I, you know, I have some people
that I'm working with that do have,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, they're doing really a great
job.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of the things that we were kind of
noticing is or they mentioned to me about
[SPEAKER_07]: the winter time growing in some soil temps
dripping, dipping.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a radiant heating system.
[SPEAKER_07]: The soil temps are up to the 70s,
but then watering with 55 degree well
[SPEAKER_07]: water will shock the roots and actually
cause your system to have to regenerate
[SPEAKER_07]: and heat back up again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, it's kind of a minute
thing, you know, when you think about it
[SPEAKER_07]: or just when you're speaking about it,
I guess you say.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you really think about it and
what you're doing, it can make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, that's why I really try
to differentiate the difference between
[SPEAKER_07]: winter mode greenhouses and summer mode
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, greenhouses were invented and
designed for winter time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you try to use them in the
summer, they can be difficult,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they'll do really well in the winter
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, something to keep in mind is
that you can really change the winter mode
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse to a summer mode, whether
you're in a hoop mid tech or a high tech
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just takes some thinking and
understanding and looking at the
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I don't think it's a good
idea for a greenhouse to decide which is
[SPEAKER_07]: the best method to go about doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, greenhouses were invented for
winter time, and most greenhouse companies
[SPEAKER_07]: are selling you a greenhouse that is going
to do what it's supposed to do,
[SPEAKER_07]: work well in the winter time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, when we talk, you know,
hey, we're going to be out in the hot
[SPEAKER_07]: summer sun, it might be the easy default
to say you need a wet wall cooling system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a wet wall is an evaporative cooler.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's basically based on water
trickling over a pad.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the exhaust fans at the opposite
end of the greenhouse exchanging the air.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully that air can be cooled
passing through the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're in a humid area,
it's not going to work that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, here in the gold country or the
foothills where we are, they can work at
[SPEAKER_07]: times, but they're not 365, 24,
7.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you get into humid places like
the Emerald Triangle, and I'm not talking
[SPEAKER_07]: terribly humid, but, you know,
over 47% relative humidity, you're not
[SPEAKER_07]: going to see much reduction in
temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why we really try to talk about
cooling surfaces rather than cooling the
[SPEAKER_07]: air to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because most greenhouse companies are
going to try to sell you a winter mode
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse as designed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the default is that evaporative
cooler, and that's just not going to work
[SPEAKER_07]: for everybody everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, again, if you understand the
cannabis plant too, you can really work
[SPEAKER_07]: well with a greenhouse in the summertime,
knowing how cannabis wants to sweat,
[SPEAKER_07]: and as easily to keep cool without a
cooling system, doing all these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the right manners and then paying
attention to that soil biology.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, some of the, I think the show goes
till about 12.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the last things that I would,
you know, wrap up with is that don't
[SPEAKER_07]: always pay attention to the environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: We in the cannabis community and industry
chase the environment so much that a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of people forget what's going on
underground.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's easy to overwater.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easy to let your soils get cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easy to let things slide sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the biology is an important part of
the system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if you want control in your
greenhouse, make sure you understand
[SPEAKER_07]: what's going on underground as well,
because the environment's only half the
[SPEAKER_07]: battle in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_13]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also think that everyone should have a
microscope and get closer to their leafs
[SPEAKER_13]: than just the real little handheld ones
that are common for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it takes a microscope or getting
in there 60, you know, or even a hundred
[SPEAKER_13]: times.
[SPEAKER_13]: And even having one that goes to your
computer screen that has a video on it
[SPEAKER_13]: that you can take a log of your pictures
or videos.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even you can take a compost tea or tea and
look at it under a microscope as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's really important to add to
what you said, Eric.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And testing your soil after every run and
testing your soil after every run makes a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we really recommend that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Testing everything is important.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the inputs these days,
you never know where you're getting it
[SPEAKER_07]: from.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you might know where you're
getting it from, but how long has it been
[SPEAKER_07]: in the bag?
[SPEAKER_07]: How long has it been, you know,
sitting around or through these processes?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we really want to make sure we're
testing all our ingredients, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: making sure that everything that we're
using is going to work because according
[SPEAKER_07]: to Nevada and it looks like maybe
California, it'll be pretty easy to fail a
[SPEAKER_07]: test if you don't follow a lot of the
proper guidelines and keeping things
[SPEAKER_07]: clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Department of Pesticide Regulation
released the allowable stuff for cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: and there isn't much allowed as far as
pesticides and fungicides and herbicides
[SPEAKER_07]: that people would want to use and maybe
even find to be organic in some cases,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's not going to be okay for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people try to, you know,
compare cannabis to other vegetables and
[SPEAKER_07]: farming.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I always try to say that, you know,
you can't take a flower and go wipe it on
[SPEAKER_07]: your shirt like you would an apple before
you eat it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't wash it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't, you know, blanch it or,
or pasteurize it or any of these other
[SPEAKER_07]: things that you do with food before it
gets to people.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people don't realize what their
food goes through before it reaches the
[SPEAKER_07]: shelves as far as being sanitized,
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so cannabis can go through some of the
same things, but, you know, UV light,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I think there's some weird
microwave things out there these days.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, at the end of the day,
you know, we can't always compare what
[SPEAKER_07]: happens in regular ag to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I see that happening a lot these days.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, making sure you know what
you're using and making sure that your
[SPEAKER_07]: soil is healthy so that you can grow
clean, healthy plants and the environment
[SPEAKER_07]: that you grow in is conducive to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, as we start to wrap up here
closer to 12 o'clock, I think it's
[SPEAKER_07]: important for everybody to let each,
all of us know how to get ahold of each
[SPEAKER_07]: other in case anybody wants to connect so
that we can share information or maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: meet up down the road or help out a friend
if we need to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, Micah, can we start off with you?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the best way for people to
understand or learn about Leaf Organics
[SPEAKER_07]: and your website and stuff?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we've got a website.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's leaforganics.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a leaf with two E's.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not to be confused with the other
9,000 leafs out there in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: world, but yeah, the Leaf Organics is a
good spot to get ahold of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, I mean, my email is micah,
M-I-C-A-H at leaforganics.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: If anyone has questions or, you know,
I'm pretty open to sharing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any social medias you want to
shout out so people can check you out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, we've got an Instagram page
and a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_09]: Leaf, I think it's just Leaf Organics is
the Leaf underscore organics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we've got a pet food company that
is basically, it's the same company,
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's just a division under Leaf called
PaleoPOP.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that website's paleopoffeed.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we kind of specialize.
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually had that before we had Leaf.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were doing kind of human-grade organic
non-GMO pet food.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we merged that into Leaf.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, people can check that out and
feel free to reach out to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're open to share our successes and our
failures.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I love the pet products.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got old dogs, so I'm using that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got pet treats, shampoo,
like all kinds of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my dogs, my animals definitely are
thanking you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool, right on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to let you guys go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to get jamming here, but I just want
to say thank you to all you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Eric and Jonathan, you guys have
definitely helped me out with greenhouse
[SPEAKER_09]: knowledge over the last few years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dragonfly Earth Medicine, you guys
have an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's super, super good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone, all the employees that we have
swear by it.

turned on to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I just wanted to give you guys a
big thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much, Chyna.

[SPEAKER_08]: Next time you're up here, you'll have to
see the new facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm going to find me an eagle leaf.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, feather one of these times under
one of those big old redwood trees and
[SPEAKER_07]: bald eagles and greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I mean, I want to move there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: JD, why don't you let us know how to get a
hold of your brother?
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_12]: The best thing for me, I guess,
is on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a Gold Country Cannabis on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've got a website going up,
goldcountrycannabis.farm.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another really cool way to get your farm
domain.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, that's the best bet.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm usually on there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody's on there that will respond and
can find me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So definitely stay in touch, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.

[SPEAKER_14]: My friends are your friends.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for having us on.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was great to do some technical farm
talk again.
[SPEAKER_14]: It made my heart sing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was nice meeting all of you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, find me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Reach out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's awesome.

[SPEAKER_07]: They're kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you guys are like, yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's good to see people trying to
have some fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is a job and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not like glamorous or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, you know, work and people make
fun out of it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, you know, I see you guys out in
the dirt and the dogs and everybody's
[SPEAKER_07]: having a good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it definitely I'll come visit
you when I'm up there next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Farmer Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so great, you know, seeing other
women in the cultivating industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really looking forward to meeting
you off screen and hanging out and sharing
[SPEAKER_03]: a hug and a smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Farmer Tom, where can we check you out?
[SPEAKER_07]: What events or things can we see?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's my card.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me at FarmerTomOrganics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on Facebook, Airman,
Instagram at Farmer Tom Lowerman and look
[SPEAKER_01]: for our FTHC scoring system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're having products in California,
Washington, Oregon and Nevada by the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look for us out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate you coming on and all
of your input and, you know, putting it
[SPEAKER_03]: out there to other people to learn,
you know, who are really needing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we are going to be having a
federal new takeover, we're really hoping
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're learning from you and
learning it the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you so much for giving out that
information and being open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks you guys for having me on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's really cool, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Brave shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for me, I mean, Dragonfly,
you're hosting the show, so I'll let you
[SPEAKER_07]: guys finally wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But me, I'm at Forever Flowering
Greenhouse is all one word on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jonathan gave you our website,
LightDepth.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're in Grass Valley, California.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're one hour away from the Sacramento
airport.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're about an hour away from Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if anybody wants to go skiing,
we're only a couple hours from the Bay,
[SPEAKER_07]: centrally located.
[SPEAKER_07]: So come check us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks again, Dragonfly, for hosting
the show while Bubble Man's in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks to Bubble Man for allowing us
to have the show while he's out of town
[SPEAKER_07]: even and his dedication to continuing the
show for all these years.
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate all that he does.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks to you guys again, Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much, Eric.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're one of our favorite
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so happy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Both you and Jonathan over the years.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know, of course, our company,
when we first came out, we kind of met out
[SPEAKER_13]: in Denver initially, even though it was on
tour and all that before.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we've been working together for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've always had a lot of love and
integrity from you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we just are really appreciative of
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, we want to move forward,
you know, in this lifetime, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: with you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks so much, Marcus, BC Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have, you know, he was doing this
way long before it was even cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he was getting a lot of havoc
and a lot of stress in his life from
[SPEAKER_03]: continuing to get the education out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's just going more and more forward.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we appreciate his family and his kids
and his wife holding it down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Shar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can reach us at
dragonflyearthmedicine.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're totally available.
[SPEAKER_03]: We spend like several hours a day just
answering random gardening questions to
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're totally dedicated to the plant and
the intention that she has and is giving
[SPEAKER_03]: out to us as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've recently finished a website
called DEMPureFarms.com, which lists all
[SPEAKER_13]: of the farms that are pure certified.
[SPEAKER_13]: It also has a whole entire page of closed
loops.
[SPEAKER_13]: When people ask, what is a closed loop?
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's not, you know, it's one on the
land.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's anything that one system leads into
the other system, whether it's alternative
[SPEAKER_13]: energy or reusing your soils or growing
your own inputs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Check out DEMPureFarms.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one example of like-minded
people, regenerative cannabis farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: joining together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do really encourage people in the
industry to join together because that's
[SPEAKER_03]: the way that this craft cannabis,
super high bomb, bomb fire is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: make it out into the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And encouraging people to work together on
the dispensary front and on the processing
[SPEAKER_13]: front to utilize their medicine and their
cannabis in an excellent way.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to Jamaica on March 1st for
two weeks ourselves, and we're being
[SPEAKER_13]: invited by a Rastafarian community there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to go really dive into
spiritual cannabis on Jamaica and learn
[SPEAKER_13]: about their ways and their ways of
connecting with the earth and midwives,
[SPEAKER_13]: the spiritual healers.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're really, really excited to talk
about regenerative cannabis there and
[SPEAKER_13]: growing and cultivating cannabis off the
grid in a spiritual way.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really important to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also we are going to be at the Living
Soil Symposium happening at the end of
[SPEAKER_13]: March, which is going to be a wonderful
collection of really beautiful people,
[SPEAKER_13]: which can help answer the question of how
to move regenerative cannabis forward.
[SPEAKER_13]: And regenerative cannabis is important
because the mainstream big ag crazy days
[SPEAKER_13]: are on our shelves now and are coming at
us.
[SPEAKER_13]: So really it's going to be our integrity
and our love and our stories and our
[SPEAKER_13]: better strains that we have that's going
to really keep us going forward.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to thank Bubble Man as well
and Skunk Man Sam for his lots of years of
[SPEAKER_13]: dedication towards bringing every,
you know, all this technical stuff
[SPEAKER_13]: forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, big up Skunk Man Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: He dropped some knowledge today that I can
really appreciate.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's other people that were not on
this panel that are really excellent at
[SPEAKER_13]: growing in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_13]: And reach out to them as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we're one group.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're sharing our story.
[SPEAKER_13]: We hope it inspires you.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all available.
[SPEAKER_13]: Check us out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Eric.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Jonathan.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks everyone here.
[SPEAKER_13]: See you all.
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Take one more toke for the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For Dennis Perrone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to our forefathers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank goodness for the forefathers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bless up.
