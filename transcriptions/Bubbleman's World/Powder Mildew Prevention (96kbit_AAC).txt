[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here and I am just
replying to all sorts of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about the PM that Johnny B sent my
way with the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen another reoccurrence of it
other than the three little dots it had on
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of fan leaves which I did remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm doing today is I'm going
to just take you guys through really quick
[SPEAKER_00]: how you can eliminate powdery mildew on
your plants or at least attempt to
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends if you've got huge trees and
shrubs outside of your grow that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking in powdery mildew right off of and
you don't realize that you're never going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just got a little bit brought
into your garden, this is a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: take care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got four liters of water inside my
five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a tablespoon of baking soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is going to help change the pH
of the surface of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll take this tablespoon and we'll
dump it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will drop just just a drop of soap in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows it to emulsify and stick
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally a teaspoon of olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows the mold spores to be trapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get that in there and get that
all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back here in the garden with the three
plants, no signs of powdery mildew as of
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why would we wait?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it was there when the clones were
given to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the mixture into my spray bottle,
which is the soap, the baking soda and the
[SPEAKER_00]: olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're just going to give it a real
nice light spray and cover all the
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do this a variety of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your thing doesn't fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always good to keep that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's stripped, so it only goes on a few
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you push it on any more than that,
it goes right around and does what you
[SPEAKER_00]: just saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you grab those bottom leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're all getting some of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't lift, trust me, they're not
all getting wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not all getting exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see even on this little one,
there's a few that aren't exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_00]: The tiniest little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally we'll get the big astro
boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll leave a little bit of residual on
the leaf, and that's okay because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: what the baking soda is changing your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have that olive oil,
which is really going once properly
[SPEAKER_00]: emulsified into the water, it's going to
trap the spores and keep them from getting
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll do this for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep an eye on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I haven't seen any PM as of
such, but since the first day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I might as well stay on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll let you guys know because you
know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays I feel that really what's the
purpose on me growing perfect crops and
[SPEAKER_00]: just sharing that information with people
when really if I can have problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can get a bug or if I can get a,
you know, there's mites and gnats and all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of different things that thank God I
don't have right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I do get them, I'm going to make a
point on sharing how I deal with them with
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a matter of really making
the attempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times, I mean really with three
small plants like this, ready to go into a
[SPEAKER_00]: garden of 20 plus plants into bloom,
it would be very easy to start over and
[SPEAKER_00]: throw these plants away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like the idea of actually gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually fixing my plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simple, simple little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One gallon of room temperature water with
a tablespoon of baking soda, a teaspoon of
[SPEAKER_00]: olive oil and a drop or two of dishwasher
soap or dish soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys have enjoyed the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sure were worried about the powdery
mildew and I appreciate all the tips that
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to give more, there's no,
no problem on sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do me a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only share things that you yourself have
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't share things that you've read about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that you've tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bottle Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
