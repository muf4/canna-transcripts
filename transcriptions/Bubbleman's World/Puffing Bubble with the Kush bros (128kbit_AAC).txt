[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with Mark and Remo, the Kush
brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_01]: We're over at Remo's place here and we
just basically ran an incredible batch a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see Kimo Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you probably saw the video footage
and the pictures that I had on my social
[SPEAKER_01]: media.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked out really lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got all the samples here put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already had a few hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually did a gauntlet about 20
minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoked them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoked every single one of them and
sort of talked a little bit about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to check that out on Remo's
channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out to your two
YouTube channels there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urban Grower and Urban Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be on Urban Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you're going to be putting
anything up anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might as well give a shout out to your
channel as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kush Brothers channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I thought we'd just do a couple of
rips for the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the smelliest bubble hash I've
ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it stinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely very nice and that's a
good sign that your hash contains alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble terpenes and terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavors and tastes that would otherwise
potentially be water soluble, which when
[SPEAKER_01]: we made the bubble, you saw that the water
in the bucket was still really nice color
[SPEAKER_01]: and it had a nice smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even drink any I don't think,
but it tastes just like cannabis tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that's the one downside to
water extraction and it's why we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to leave the hash in the water for
too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it robs those flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The alcohol soluble terpenes are not
robbed in the water washing, so we end up
[SPEAKER_01]: with that full flavor, which is why your
hash smells like a concentrated version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that flash freezing thing also save
some of those terpenoids flavoring?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are like they want to leave it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely still leaving it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea of playing around in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I can imagine saving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting much more of this seems turpene
full, but the idea of getting low
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, cold environments almost like a
walk-in freezer or a walk-in fridge that
[SPEAKER_01]: allows a cold environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The colder the better, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things evaporate at room
temperature, so they have variable colds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any added heat whatsoever is going to even
evaporate them out more so.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cold, generally, you put something,
if you're curing your hash, sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: people are like, I cured my hash in the
freezer, and then you're suspending your
[SPEAKER_01]: hash evaporation only as it was from the
first day that you did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same with her, and I'm going to
keep it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just sort of hold it in that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy with how this turned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely super flavorful,
super melty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to doing the macro
videos and pictures of the mouth factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This 90 in particular just got me all
excited to take a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that what we're hitting first,
this 90?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're from a rock to 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I remember from our last
gauntlet, this was the most potent and
[SPEAKER_00]: killer of them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the 160 was just nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 120, okay, now I'm feeling that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was using it more medicinally,
like my friend John, for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's got quite a few breaks and whatnot,
he just feels it right away when he takes
[SPEAKER_01]: a good rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of feels his knees relieved and
his ankles sort of aren't hurting quite as
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt that from the 120, but after this
one, after a hit for a few minutes,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was epically stunned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turbo death kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprised me, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you guys just smoked 30 chats.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are going to be doing a super
charge your joint video coming up here
[SPEAKER_01]: soon, too, and they're going to be adding
all sorts of wonderful things into their
[SPEAKER_01]: monstrous joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're welcome to participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to
chain smoke bowls of melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you guys are... That's
participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's going to count.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the color on this is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super, super light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you just been keeping this in a cool
place?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really held on to its blonde color,
like almost as though it was in a fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite amazing to see the different
shades, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big toke, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a big toke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going all out, knowing that I don't
have to do a gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the gauntlet was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gauntlet was awesome, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be up on Reel's channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole bubble hash video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turning that UBC chemo push, some of that
really nice fresh frozen trim into,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, isolated glandular trichome
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to say that the magic
really happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, it's nice to know someone that knows
the process and isn't going to make any
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always...
[SPEAKER_01]: a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my opinion, the majority of the
difficulty in coming up with a product
[SPEAKER_01]: like this happens in the grow room where
Remo's sort of making, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking control of everything and making
sure things are going right instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you get your full melt hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bags themselves, they're really,
really just a tool that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate the glandular trichome for you to,
you know, a 99% purity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to necessarily give you
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this hash took us four and a half
months to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in the long run, it took four and a
half months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four and a half months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was well worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For it to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been there the whole,
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, look at Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks like he was well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just blasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: No tasty, smooth, no cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for coming out and being a part
of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, just thanks for having me,
Remo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being here too, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wicked, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to continue on
puffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going, Remo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a whole bunch of OG kush plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty tall girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the real tall ones over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, we'll follow you to the real
tall ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's almost to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 6'2", with a two and a half to three
foot arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can just touch the top of that cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one over there is taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got some plants that are taller
than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate kush from DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chocolate kush from DNA are some tall
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to follow, Remo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all this thing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was one of those forever chances,
this thing would be hitting the ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big size nights on that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the most pronounced nobs of
anything in the room right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got some white OG over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one on the end here we can get to
quite easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in that little corridor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, the white OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the white OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, this room looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells pretty great too, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take much for you to disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then reappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it smells wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, you have a real trichome forest
here, no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sure have great air in here,
Remo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the green hornet, LED green lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower cycle is in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green light does not affect the light
cycle of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can be in here and enjoying it
without causing your flowering period any
[SPEAKER_01]: detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Remo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a pleasure to be here in your
grove.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, playing around with the resin
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a pleasure having you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you soon.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
