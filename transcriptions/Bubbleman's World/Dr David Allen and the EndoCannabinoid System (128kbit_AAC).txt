[SPEAKER_02]: We're filming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be, uh, I'll be like, welcome,
welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, today we're sitting with Mark
Klocke, the weed guy, and a special guest,
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. David Allen, who's in the house today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I actually met you the first time
at, uh, the Cush Cup- Health Expo last
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's a 30-year heart surgeon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, I was going to say,
actually, if you could tell everyone a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit about yourself, just a quick
couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good start in how you kind of got
into this, uh, I mean, I'm excited today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I'm excited today is that Dr.
David Allen is, um, uh, to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: he, he's like, uh, an endocannabinoid
specialist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of what I've learned about
the endocannabinoid system and shared on
[SPEAKER_02]: my channel, I've learned through Dr. David
Allen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's a professor of endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so let you tell a little bit about
that.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, I'm a retired heart surgeon,
and, um, I have been using cannabis since
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 17 years old, and, um, and use it
virtually every day, only, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: after work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I, I knew that there was
something special about the, about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, that it worked better than other
medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, as I, I finally decided I wanted
to go into just cannabis research and quit
[SPEAKER_00]: doing heart surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, that's what I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we're finding out that this new
science is, um, is going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're here talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And change the way we look at cannabis as
a medicine, because it was actually you,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, that mentioned to me at the health
expo last year, um, in regards to why we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't need prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: For it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure if you remember saying
this, but you said it's a preventative
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no need to prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be allowed to use it as a
preventative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's, it's actually diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We consider it a nutraceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is it's a nutritional
thing that your body uses kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: broccoli or something that, uh,
improves your nutritional health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the endocannabinoid system is a,
a mechanism that can controls whether you
[SPEAKER_00]: get diabetes or not, it controls whether
you get cancer or not, and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're finding out that really when we
eat cannabis, we augment our own body's
[SPEAKER_00]: natural ability to, to heal itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so smoking cannabis helps you as well,
but we're actually finding out that eating
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, especially if you eat it raw,
it has a much more potent medical effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like you're going to get high
if you eat raw cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually like a nutritional
supplement, like a food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a healthy food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when the war is over and, and,
uh, cannabis is finally legal and this
[SPEAKER_00]: will happen, uh, you'll be able to go to
Walmart and, uh, buy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be in your cereal and
other food stuff and you'll feed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: your children.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't get them high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the juice bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea too, where people will be
growing large amounts of like clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like they do with the wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have fresh, you know, if they not
juice, they blend it all to get more of
[SPEAKER_01]: the fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it'd be like an orange Julius.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wanted to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but Julius, you wouldn't be
getting high off it, but wouldn't it be
[SPEAKER_01]: cool to have a whole bunch of clones
continually going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just basically juicing them
like you do wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty incredible time that we can
find out a another chapter in how
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly beneficial cannabis is to
mankind and even dog kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects, uh, everybody a little
differently and it affects some animals
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, this dog, it, uh, is extremely
strong on it lasts for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we gave it, uh, a little piece of
a cannabis cookie one time and it lasted
[SPEAKER_00]: almost three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so what that means is that some
animals have enzyme systems that degrade
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, uh, that are different from
other animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, it's not really, uh,
delineated which breeds, uh, tolerate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis better or what, what size of
animal this research is still needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how when you ask a question or make
a comment, the doctor just goes right into
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you doctor for all your knowledge
and that's what really needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a message to other doctors
that are as intelligent as you who are
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of blind to the real facts of the
benefits of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, one day they're going to have to
be held accountable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of, uh, Dr. Gupta who wrote that
time magazine article and has since
[SPEAKER_01]: retracted it and actually did a couple of
specials on CNN.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's doubling down on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's almost like they're being obtuse
about, you know, like as doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, did they even study, did they even
study the endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, funny you should ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, last summer I, uh, did a study where
we called all the medical schools in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called 157 medical schools and we asked
the directors of the curriculum,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, if, uh, they taught the
endocannabinoid science to the students,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they, if they had a director of
endocannabinoid science, if they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: department, if they taught the ECS as an
organized course, or if they even
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned the ECS in any ancillary courses
like pathophysiology, pharmacology or
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroanatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer was only 13% even mentioned
it and nobody has an organized course or a
[SPEAKER_00]: department, uh, with a director.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, this shows that the doctors
that graduate this year are not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be knowledgeable in the ECS, which is a
control system that controls everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finding out that, that even
conception, uh, if you, if you block the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, uh, you can
prevent sperm from entering the ovum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can prevent, uh, impregnation,
uh, uh, if you block the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a real important system,
um.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're meaning to tell me they've left
out a piece of the anatomy of the body
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching medical doctors in all these
schools?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like your doctor not knowing
that there's a circulatory system or a
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems at least that important when you
consider what you said about it earlier
[SPEAKER_02]: and how it regulates your body and the
deciding factor on whether you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get diabetes or cancers or you would want
to know about that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The importance of this is, uh,
is really, we're just kind of coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the full meaning of what,
what really the importance of the ECS is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it, it's virtually the key of
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is the fountain of youth in,
uh, because it stops, uh, antioxidant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it stops oxidation from happening to the
cells and, uh, many diseases that we now
[SPEAKER_00]: currently have names for, uh, will no
doubt in the near future be found to be
[SPEAKER_00]: defects in the, uh, either production or
degradation of the endocannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, molecules that your body produces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hearing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that you're sharing this with our
audience and that you've been sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: this, you know, with many audiences
throughout your Facebook and through the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube page and he speaks at many of your
conferences and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so the importance of all of this
is, is this, uh, if we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing diabetes, um, then we're going
to be preventing, uh, everything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be preventing amputations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be preventing, uh, uh, kidney
dialysis and we'll be preventing dot
[SPEAKER_00]: blindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there are studies that prove that
if you use cannabis for 20 years or more,
[SPEAKER_00]: just even smoking it, that it decreases
the incidence of diabetes by 66%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like a miracle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a miracle when you think of both the
suffering and the emotional state of mind
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would also be decreasing in all
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that didn't have to get dialysis is
terrible for people to have to go through
[SPEAKER_02]: that when really they, they maybe they
wouldn't have to go through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these politicians that think
they're doing right by passing laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: make marijuana illegal and arresting
people, they really don't understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to pass a law that would
prevent their own family from having a
[SPEAKER_00]: stroke or heart attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand that they're,
they're preventing science from advancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so just killing people and causing
suffering, but that can't be accidental.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I'm not trying to get into
a big conspiracy rant here or anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they do sell sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it seems more like an agenda than it
does an accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you accidentally spend,
you know, hundreds of billions of dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: on propaganda and lies and somehow like
even guys like Sanjay Gupta, I believe
[SPEAKER_02]: there's more of him out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe doctors are bad people,
but I believe somehow a system has been
[SPEAKER_02]: built to specifically, it prevents them
from talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's famous enough to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your income stream comes from that
realm, then it's hard to challenge that
[SPEAKER_00]: realm because it'll challenge your income
stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he literally got you by the bank
account.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it seems like some of the most
important information going right now to
[SPEAKER_02]: share with a family member or loved one or
friend that you know is in any time type
[SPEAKER_02]: of element right now, there's so many
different elements that can be fixed by
[SPEAKER_02]: simply feeding your endocannabinoid system
just from these deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't even know they have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it really, it seems that these
endocannabinoid deficiencies, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: make you think different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and really the people that are making
the laws, you for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pass laws that they think sound
reasonable, but on further examination,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you smoke pot, you can see
the folly in the laws that they've passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they think they're reasonable,
but people that smoke pot kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that they can't be reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that folly is a real danger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes them look bad too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that, that, that mistake that
they're making, it does make them look
[SPEAKER_02]: bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's just cheesy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't think properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke cannabis, you actually think
better, uh, than if you don't smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're kind of inhibited if you
don't use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention they're putting out
something that's such a lie that when they
[SPEAKER_02]: put out something that's the truth,
how are young people supposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: acknowledge the difference when they see
one thing that's clearly folly to them
[SPEAKER_02]: because they've also perhaps smoked
cannabis or know someone that's using it
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinally or recreationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they know that those things are not
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's stuff like alcohol,
which kills people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a direct contradiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, alcohol is potentially one of the
most dangerous drugs we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of which prime minister Harper,
a huge party to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not an 18 year old girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: My alcohol poisoning is really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can die from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People do die from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely, you should have thrown a
pop party.
[SPEAKER_02]: You went about so much press.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, we would have been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the government is caught in lies,
uh, it makes the population mistrust that
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so what it really does is it
creates a, an animosity between the people
[SPEAKER_00]: and the government, which affects the
government on other levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the government needs to be truthful,
um, for the people to really, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: trust the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if they want their foundation to be
made out of like stone instead of sand,
[SPEAKER_02]: they should be truthful and be honest and
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's a liar, but at least you know
what you get with that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do know what you get with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if only we could get someone that you
get, if we could get someone who you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the same way, but isn't actually like
that, like a good, just a good,
[SPEAKER_02]: this goes back to people that aren't using
cannabis, people that aren't using
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: These generally this type of person,
they, the people that want to rule and
[SPEAKER_02]: control are generally not the same people
who want to grow cannabis and use
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the real people that want
to control other people become presidents
[SPEAKER_02]: and become directors and become the head
of the whatever they're generally in their
[SPEAKER_02]: own right.
[SPEAKER_02]: On a different path.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also the industries that they
control and they're trying to keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they don't agree or don't care about
pot, but they, they sure do care about the
[SPEAKER_01]: forest industry or the pharmaceutical
industry and what it will do to that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you 25 years ago,
it was such a different world in Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: and literally, I'm not sure how long it's
been now about 94, so about 20,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years since we got our first hemp field
growing in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll never forget that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never forget my ex partner from back
then, Martin saying, this will change the
[SPEAKER_02]: way people see it when they start seeing
this stuff growing on the side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: road.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to, it's kind of,
because you know, in Manitoba it would
[SPEAKER_01]: have been like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised so many people don't know
that marijuana and hemp are the same
[SPEAKER_01]: things, the male and the female.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another little fib we had to tell
our government, you know, that hemp was a
[SPEAKER_02]: distant relative of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used that very wording with the
minister of finance and agriculture and we
[SPEAKER_02]: felt like it was a viable, it was okay to
tell that fib.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever gets you growing in your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the THC limits were so low that sure,
you could probably raise the THC limits
[SPEAKER_02]: even in that strain if you bred it over
the course of the amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably 40 to 50 or whatever,
but still, it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's genetics is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the... It's still got a little bit
of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Point zero one, you can never get rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you want it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for us, we wanted that at that time
just to get hemp in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seemed like it was also an okay thing,
because we got slack from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to ruin pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were freaking out about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're growing it to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were our supposed supporters.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just jealous you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what about the ritualistic use of
cannabis for thousands of years and what
[SPEAKER_01]: do you think about how it's only been in
the last 100 years that they really
[SPEAKER_01]: bastardized it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before then, it's been used in tradition
from all sorts of different cultures and
[SPEAKER_01]: races, from the Scythians, the Egyptians.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of mankind, it's only really been
a very small blink in time that it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal and persecuted like it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what I'm trying to say is,
do you think that it's going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: reversed or you think it's just been an
implementation of trying to control the
[SPEAKER_00]: plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy how a government has spent all
this money and energy and built up all
[SPEAKER_00]: these weapons systems and information
systems to fight a plant and the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like it's winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's winning because the war is based on
false information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people think they're passing just
laws, but they're passing laws against
[SPEAKER_00]: something that will stop diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In what bizarre world does that make sense
where you can pass a law against something
[SPEAKER_00]: that cures disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the lack of hard evidence of
physical side effects from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's never been presented.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that just a travesty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no dead bodies, is what I'm trying
to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can this be when there's millions of
people being killed by alcohol and
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you understand what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason we don't know more
information about cannabis and its ill
[SPEAKER_00]: effects is because they don't allow
scientists to study it because of its
[SPEAKER_00]: classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CSA has five schedules and they're all
illegal and cannabis is schedule one and
[SPEAKER_00]: the only difference in schedule one and
the other schedules is if it's schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: one, scientists can't study it without
special permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything in schedule one, a scientist or a
doctor can't study.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was made schedule two, it would
still be illegal for people to own,
[SPEAKER_00]: but doctors could study it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seemed to want to use the excuse that
if doctors were studying it, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: have stashes of it that could be diverted
to the public for non-medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't hold water, but the truth is
the whole scheduling was made to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific study, so we made knowledge
illegal by this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty impressive thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a terrible blow right there when
they did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, I believe, from 1937,
from the Narcotics Peace Treaty?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Control Substance Act came into effect
in 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened was in 1937, they passed the
Marijuana Tax Stamp Act and that made
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana illegal, except for medicinal
use, it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have marijuana, you could have it
legally if you had this tax stamp,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they didn't give out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to have the marijuana in hand to
get the stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened was Timothy Leary was busted
at the Mexican border.
[SPEAKER_00]: His daughter was carrying some marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was busted and he went to jail for her
carrying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard him tell that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened was he was sent to jail for
a long time and he filed an appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: His lawyers argued that if you had to have
the marijuana to get the tax stamp,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that was self-incrimination and
therefore it was constitutionally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The court agreed with Timothy Leary,
so for a short time after that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that court ruling, marijuana was
technically legal in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people didn't know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It forced their hand because they had a
legal loophole that people were not using.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to close that legal loophole.
[SPEAKER_00]: They designed this Control Substance Act
in a fashion that, well, they thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, now how can we make marijuana
illegal so no one can ever make it legal
[SPEAKER_00]: again?
[SPEAKER_00]: They came up with this crazy
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CSA-1 has three points.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has high potential for abuse and since
there's no criteria for what that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes it an undefinable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not currently used for medicinal use,
and as we all know that prior to 37,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was one of the most prescribed
medicines, but they get around that by
[SPEAKER_00]: saying currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the third thing was not safe under
physician guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since physicians can't prescribe Schedule
I substances, that held true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used this triple threat of a criteria
to make marijuana illegally in a really
[SPEAKER_00]: unconstitutional means.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely a pretty near fatal blow
to cannabis for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I do remember Andrew Wheel did a
study in 1965.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I understand is if they're,
sorry to interrupt you, but if it was
[SPEAKER_01]: being prescribed, you said the most,
previous to 1937, wasn't there any doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: protesting like, hey, now I can't
prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was useful?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was, and there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to think about information too
though, how information was passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really slow back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was a large amount of doctors
that were being arrested and thrown in
[SPEAKER_00]: jail for still using cannabis tinctures
because every major pharmaceutical company
[SPEAKER_00]: had preparations using cannabis tinctures
and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctors were still using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened was the AMA kind of made
amends with the government and allowed it
[SPEAKER_00]: to be taken off the pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The year prior to that, they had arrested
10,000 doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The year after that, they arrested like
seven doctors or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking the most medicinal plant ever off
of the pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a bizarre world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where these people for ulterior motives
make something that's healthy for you
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal, something that could save your
grandmother's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy how this law evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so multi-useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say your grandma's life, but I thought
it was your child's seizures or your own
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It saved my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a big heist, an amazing heist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel blessed on one point in the sense
that even though we're still fighting for
[SPEAKER_02]: our rights, we're able to have our little
gardens and we're able to grow our own
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine, but it's still under the threat
of being taken away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they've made it criminally more
illegal to grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one side of the marijuana law here
for medical use, but on the other side,
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvard has been making it a longer jail
term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mandatory minimums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, mandatory minimums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which even some judges have already been
like, we're not doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're not enforcing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense because he wants to fill
his private prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make it illegal if you had a
substance that you could eat and it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get too high and would decrease the
incidence of diabetes by 66%, and your
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor can't give you any other medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other medicine that decreases
the incidence of diabetes by 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your doctor could give you this
stuff that would do this, and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: make a law against that, that makes the
lawyers and the politicians that pass
[SPEAKER_00]: these laws look pretty ignorant when you
examine their laws under the truth of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, but if you examine the actual
true agenda, they're brilliant because
[SPEAKER_02]: their evil agenda needs evil, and they're
really good at their evil, and that's how
[SPEAKER_02]: they can pass those laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not doing it accidentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for such big money, and why are they
doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's because certain companies,
90% of their pain management medications
[SPEAKER_02]: alone, just pain management.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a double threat,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they had hemp for the tree
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the largest industries in
North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50,000 commercial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: From hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of the pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had two really powerful industries
that were lobbying for it, and owned by
[SPEAKER_01]: only a handful of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people need to realize that the
pharmaceutical industry was family-owned
[SPEAKER_01]: basically back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with the hemp, the way we've been
allowed to grow it here in Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were young activists when we fought for
that right, and when we got it,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were so happy to get it, so happy to
change the law from experimental to
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're growing it for seed,
and the seed oil is too expensive to run
[SPEAKER_02]: engines on, so we can only sell it at
high-end grocery stores where you can put
[SPEAKER_02]: it on your salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a failed hemp industry in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that all we have is hemp food,
that's all we got out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: From 15 to 20 years ago, there's still no
fiber being produced, there's still no
[SPEAKER_02]: Crete, there's still no hemp metal,
there's still no all of these products
[SPEAKER_02]: that we should be producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still feel there's a long way to go
for that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same way we're fighting even still for
our... And even if you don't use
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, these marijuana laws are used
against you to restrict your freedoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, this marijuana issue affects
everybody, even if you don't use the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, in Canada, it costs you
money to be able to enforce these archaic
[SPEAKER_01]: laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs you to get the police and the
judge and the sheriffs and the jails.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't even follow their rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make rules and then don't follow
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sovereignty rules that say police from
other countries aren't allowed to come
[SPEAKER_02]: into other countries, and police.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then how did the DEA come up into BC
and take Mark Emery away?
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw them arrest him, Michelle and Greg,
and take them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and they also use our own police
services to execute it with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're puppets.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always think to like, there's a lot
of countries that that would never happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine Japan going into China
and sending police into... And the Guam
[SPEAKER_02]: army just came into the hemp BC or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was also... Always when I
make this point, it's like Mark had no
[SPEAKER_01]: charges in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like he had some crazy charges
that he would get five years for in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was clearly a personal vendetta
with the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: government had against Mark, not only
because of his outspoken activism,
[SPEAKER_02]: but what's more threatening than an
activist is a wealthy activist who will
[SPEAKER_02]: put all his money into his activism,
like sending Americans bail money and
[SPEAKER_02]: helping Americans move out of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: into Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And spreading the word to overgrow the
government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he never gave up his money.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just gave it all back.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were like, Mark charges too much
for seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like he gives it all away to...
Listen, when you go to a silent auction
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's for some cool event that you want
to support, do you think the intent is to
[SPEAKER_02]: pay less for the auction item?
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to pay more.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how a silent auction works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to pay more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get a little something back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Mark was doing with the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't want to have to explain it
to everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, you're paying more because of what
I'm doing with the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you stoked to be watching what I'm
doing with the money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, what you got with Mark is
what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got 20, 30 different strains of
different seeds for Mark and they always
[SPEAKER_01]: were bang on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people realize you actually
got to import those and go get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just go buy them and ship 5,000
different seeds into Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, for one, am looking very forward to
getting Mark back to B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be a star.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have awakened a sleeping giant with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they ever?
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug war is failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is his last gasp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we need to do is make sure people
get involved and make sure that the new
[SPEAKER_00]: laws that come out make sense and don't
punish people for using a medicine that
[SPEAKER_00]: helps their diabetes, it helps their
anxiety, it helps their sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps them eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, either way, from back in the day
when they pulled the teeth out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: hashish eaters in Cairo, in like the 14th
century, that was their version of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Controlled Substance Act or any of these
other preventatives to getting us not to
[SPEAKER_02]: use this magical plant, like spending
billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like David said, I think cannabis
might be winning this war.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pulling their teeth out in the square
didn't stop these guys from eating hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at that point they could have
figured it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, these people really like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are willing to have pulling their
teeth out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pulling their teeth out with like brutal,
probably not even well made pliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that they probably used
cannabis afterwards for the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still used it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still kept using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still gathered.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still use it to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: People aren't going to stop using this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that, you know... That's why
I want to go to Kashgar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard it's in the west of China.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to the north to Turpan where
that old mummy was.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the 789 grams of procured cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the oldest pharmaceutical used.
[SPEAKER_02]: I held some of those seeds from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they came around.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they gave some to Stunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so when I was at his house one day
and he was like, he's like, check this
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, I was like,
what the?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if it was some of the
weed or it was just the seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, those are the oldest
seeds ever found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was the oldest pharmaceutical
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it was in the desert up
north.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had them in a little glass vial.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also has the world's smallest seeds
from, I believe, Nepal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the largest seeds from China,
which look like small walnuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow, I never knew that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that big.
[SPEAKER_02]: But way bigger than any seed you've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, four or five times bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I heard in Kashgar they have the
world's largest outdoor market every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I think it would be cool just
to go experience that sort of feel of this
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy market that everyone from all over
comes into China, that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a crazy big market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, buy some hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: The world's changing, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these places are getting cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some friends of mine that own a seed
company were telling me that people from
[SPEAKER_02]: Iraq have been ordering lots of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, don't they hang it
there or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it must be getting cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the books, but they haven't done
it in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the fact that people are ordering
seeds and going back to Iraq.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even on my YouTube account, I notice some
of the crazy countries that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: watching with the analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, whoa, Saudi Arabia.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all people, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because we live under different
rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was in Sri Lanka, the Mount Lavinia
Hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had been there for a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I came out, and the front desk
guy, he was like, I know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been to Sri Lanka in my life,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a younger guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, my god, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, all the way in Sri Lanka.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have that many subscribers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could have three and still meet
that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the unique thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's how small it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually when I have an experience like
that, I feel like I'm exactly where I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him a $20 tip when we left,
which is... Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I call charity is when you
really need somebody you know the money's
[SPEAKER_01]: going directly to their family and it
means so much to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate donating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind charities, but a lot of
times, it's not very one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see where your money's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going into a charity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've probably got a great
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them are good out there and
have a low, low, low overhead,
[SPEAKER_01]: although some of them sure it's the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you just actually go person to
person and do something nice for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's nice about traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to do nice things for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start by being nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, it's pretty blessed here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know we have poor people here,
but in reality, we have great social
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have welfare check, the food bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of ways to live a better
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even disabled people are in permanent
disability or your Medicare is all covered
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I travel, it's like a lot of
people are...
[SPEAKER_01]: We have it better than most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a perfect system, obviously,
but healthcare alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have a bone rail transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that's a quarter of a million in
the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our governments gave us licenses to grow
wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they didn't get it to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a Supreme Court rule enforcing them
to give us access.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, just applying... Terry
Parker had to take it to Supreme Court to
[SPEAKER_01]: enforce them to allow us to be able to
have access.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never did.
[SPEAKER_02]: For hemp, we wrote in and we were like,
can we get an application?
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, there is no application.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we created it by sending in our kind
of, this is what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they sent it back and they said,
no, you got to do this, this, and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we do all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that went on for like nine months,
just back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did it with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it with Jeff Kahn and Joe Strobel
in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did it with, I believe they were
also... There's some guy in Alberta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario,
I believe, with the three provinces that
[SPEAKER_02]: did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what year was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: 1994, 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's an amazing thing to hold in
your life dear to your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp is only in its miniscule stages in
Canada, like you're saying, with the
[SPEAKER_01]: products it's not producing yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope a liberal government and some
hungry Albertan and Saskatchewan farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: decide to just like, I'm going to plant
thousands of acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand why they're not into
biodiesel and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the oils are in like the five...
Because like I said, I mentioned it
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The way they've got it set up is not...
The oils are too valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I'm in 2008 still.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were hitting 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should show them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were hitting the bubble from 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is six plus years old, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice and it's not quite
shatter consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like taking a time machine in
2008.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was cold, it would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't the right... It's fruit roll up.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should hit a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to go first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lose my little piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe not... Does it not snap off as
well?
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as I thought it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would make it more viable in an
oil farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because of the processing?
[SPEAKER_01]: For fuel?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because of the value they've put on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the supermarket and see how much
that oil is valued.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like $70.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because of the cost as well to
produce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no good infrastructure set up for
that to be on a huge level, like a
[SPEAKER_02]: continent type level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then America is a beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people and consumers are in that
country?
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada could be growing hemp full time
just to fuel America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though America themselves could grow,
I think it's about 6% of their marginal
[SPEAKER_02]: land, not even their good land,
could grow all the BTUs, at least it could
[SPEAKER_02]: back in 2000 for the entire country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a Jack Harare emperor wears
no clothes calculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: RIP.
Biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a couple hours here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're guaranteed to be fully medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt of such things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you always have such a
variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, we deserve it, don't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do deserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We deserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say we, I mean everyone.
Everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of my whole trip on why I'm always
showing people how to dry sift and wet
[SPEAKER_02]: wash and just giving all the tricks and
tips away to people so they themselves can
[SPEAKER_02]: experience what I like to call the
unadulterated cannabinoid high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's such a gentle energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such an incredible energy that you
can't, I've learned that, I mean sure,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing it great is super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm less impressed with trying to grow it
greater than trying to isolate it greater.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the isolation factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well I want to thank these guys
for coming down and talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in bubble world, sorry dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you David.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The knowledge is amazing and you're
definitely a pioneer in the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no real idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've seen a couple photos of you
before, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But wow, just amazing stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Doctor, you're such an expert in the
endocannabinoid system and just your life
[SPEAKER_01]: experience alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel privileged being with these two
awesome guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
