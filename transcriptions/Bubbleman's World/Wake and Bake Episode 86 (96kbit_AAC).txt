[SPEAKER_01]: All right, welcome back, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tried this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technical difficulties, it does occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Wake and Bake episode 86,
and glad to have you all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of problems with my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finding that the encoder with the
phone no longer works properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to go live, it goes black.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turn it on, I go to go live again,
and then it's flipped the phone vertical,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not something I want personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm back, I'm back, and we're making it
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that were wondering what
I was holding up in the last photo,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was, of course, some heavenly days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did show it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the green, God's green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some sweet skunk rosin,
and I've got some Congolese rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all made from some lovely hashes,
although maybe God's green crack was made
[SPEAKER_01]: from herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I figured we'd open up a little and
have some puff puffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have some puff puffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yes, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to be bringing the drone to
Jamaica, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I went through some pictures
earlier today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I posted it on Facebook, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my friends from the years of going
to Jamaica, and there's some great people
[SPEAKER_01]: out there that I've been visiting with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I thought it would be a cool post
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're on my Facebook page,
go check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give thanks to Rastafari, the energy that
brought many of the people into my life
[SPEAKER_01]: through Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely was the Rastafarian vibes that
I've always seemed to vibe out on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this shirt was a gift from Sabo Shen,
from VapeXHale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about VapeXHale the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it nice and close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to have a big VapeXHale
session here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we'll do is we'll invite Sabo in
because he's just a very articulate
[SPEAKER_01]: speaker and he's very intelligent when it
comes to the message that he's sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's who gave me the shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Sabo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, why don't we have a
little puff?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've opened up the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to hit it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hit it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to wake the bake.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little shards of goodness here in the wake
and bake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode, well, 86.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, morning pharmacy bros from Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope life is good up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who Jason S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bingo Lombardi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: No sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone else have sound?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it wasn't Jamaica, why would I be
wearing this hat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about your shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just told you about my shirt a
little bit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: McCann athlete.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure you can,
okay, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I needed to know is that you
guys all had sound and that we weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, talking with no sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to tell you about my
shirt other than what I just told you
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's best if Sabo comes in and shares
that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where he's at today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hit this, shall we?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more of a wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that low temp happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a story, Uncle Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a wicked rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it when I damn near take the whole
rip in one shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime on the low, low, low,
low temp dabs, you end up getting like 50
[SPEAKER_01]: rips out of the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is the pump?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should give some shit away today,
shouldn't I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pump isn't the pump if it's not giving
shit away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, new age utopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The giveaway has not happened yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get something given away
here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice count of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff hitting that green drag and the
real green drag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got some great, great,
great results with working with those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Tony was happy as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't even consider grabbing trim
from just anyone as we really mostly deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had some really, really nice
trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trim that I haven't seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get people focused on taking
care, being OCD, really making sure you're
[SPEAKER_01]: paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, back in the day, I used to make
the top, top, top quality with trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the trim was basically like nugget.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the tiny little leaves just chopped
off the buds, nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that trim produced incredible quality
as well as yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a large surface area on such
materials that you would get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would get yields comparable to bud for
that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Green Dragon's been doing work for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're 20 plus years around, so they're
growers for certain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're breeding,
but they're definitely grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want to bother, Karsten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, every little bit that I've
broken my rule and been like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send some and then it gets lost and
then it's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or then the vat is 18% and everyone cries
like a baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they say, oh, don't put the real value
because the vat is so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we send it without the real value
and it gets lost and it's uninsured and
[SPEAKER_01]: they want me to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of the reasons why I'm not
sending terpenes to Europe from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish it was easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish this wasn't the case, but this is
exactly the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just not worth the energy,
the stress of getting all choked and
[SPEAKER_01]: pissed off, but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going on this banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, David Forker, you are getting me
live right now, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Woody Woody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but trust me, the UK was the same
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: People sending it to the UK, complaining
about the vat or when it gets lost and the
[SPEAKER_01]: real amount isn't on there and they spent
a thousand bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't owe me an apology, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure why you would say that,
but whatever, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like you've done me wrong,
just do me right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do me wrong anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salton ISO isn't as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a rig on my ant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chalice Chugger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I was looking for
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size t-shirt are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can get this damn giveaway over with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chalice Chugger with the win, with the
thoughtful, unique, funny, inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your... Yeah, just do me right,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly didn't mean it in the way I
think you were thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chalice Chugger, medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I do have a medium with your name
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your shirt, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wouldn't mind, this is a medium,
sending me an email at bcbubbleman,
[SPEAKER_01]: bcbubbleman at iCloud.com with your
address and I will send out all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: things I still haven't sent out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's four or five of them
sitting on the table now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try, I try, I try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have seen that, Justin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it together when you told me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it together once you told me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be filming at the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, last year I got very busy and
here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to film at the Karma Cup the best
that I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm speaking, so I'll probably
film that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put a camera up on a tripod.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not sure how much else I'll get to
film.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some sessions, maybe a quick walk
around and some interviews with the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are around or at least Sarah who's
throwing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am going to Jamaica prior to the
Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will be in Jamaica this month and
I'll be visiting the acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be visiting a process facility,
a bottling plant and a packaging facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be visiting the doctor's conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get to talk to a lot of the
different doctors about how they view
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as a medicine in Jamaica and what
the future is going to bring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hey, do you still do videos with Dan?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure who Dan is, Austin LaFrez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might still do videos with Dan,
but right off the top of my head,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Jamaica Wake and Bakes the Island
Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to be bomber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B is coming with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B is going to be telling his
patient story to the doctors and bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: his crazy, crazy information with his
x-rays and all the doctors I think he's
[SPEAKER_01]: got like a 21 page thing that explains
exactly everything that he's gone through
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, Tony V is going to be in
the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our partners will be there prior to that
in Kingston at a different doctor's
[SPEAKER_01]: conference training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a couple of representatives from
United Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're really just all in all super
excited about how this is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: coming together here slowly but surely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true, Adam smokes a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is hard to do videos while at one of
those events.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there at KNAK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be hard for you not to meet me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a booth and you just come right
up to it and introduce yourself and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: have met.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably puff a turp dip dab and
we'll go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you repeat your email one more time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm a stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem, Chalice Chugger.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email is bcbubbleman at icloud.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my email.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on, weed nerd?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you need organic help in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have a pretty incredible organic
gardener, Ernie, who is our master
[SPEAKER_01]: gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew for River Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess like Scott from Rare Dankness,
Dread Smokes Weed and a couple other
[SPEAKER_01]: growers would have been under Ernie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Ernie's sort of grow that he was
overlooking and those guys were helping
[SPEAKER_01]: and operating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an exceptional grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we might be getting the skunk man Sam
to come out and do some breeding for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ernie is very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the herb that jibs and can the melts,
the trichome heavy extracts guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of that herb back in the day was
being produced by Ernie and his knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows how to grow big monster plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows how to do micro teas and brews.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's good to go, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ernie is a good, a great fucking grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a hash maker, those are the kind of
growers that I want to make hash for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to have to go through a
hundred people that think they're good and
[SPEAKER_01]: need me to explain through the bags and
the hash that I make that in fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't want to hear that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get aggressive about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality is the bags are the word of
God.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the quality of what
you've created because it's producing a
[SPEAKER_01]: purity that is the only way you could tell
that quality of product by purifying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I see the evolution of
weed in North America in the next 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, you know, I'd love to see it
available everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see it available everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's the case, a lot will happen
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might get pigeonholed down to three
different things, but it might expand even
[SPEAKER_01]: more than it is today and be, you know,
be hemp was always about being about
[SPEAKER_01]: 50,000 commercial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always bragged about hemp because it
had 50,000 commercial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cannabis will easily have 50,000
cultivars, 50,000 terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the amounts that the ratios exist
in and how they change and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes there are in rare ones that
barely exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the ratios with the cannabinoids,
there are endless possibilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: way more than 50,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really becomes about who wants to go
into that mystery and find something
[SPEAKER_01]: unique and amazing because there's a lot
to be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's be honest, not that many
people have focused their attentions on
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beeman, the pump, the hammer, translating
the word of God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big squirrel nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, because I read your name and then
that makes me laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I see your avatar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if that's you,
but you look like a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely like someone I would hang out
with on the regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your humor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate most of your humors and
all of your energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for coming in guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beeman, why do some Jamaican grow males
with the females?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it for seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some are doing it for seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously some are doing it because they
don't know how to get rid of the males,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to call the males quick enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some just sneak up on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some are very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who are hyper aware,
the people who are paying more attention,
[SPEAKER_01]: they do a better job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just like, obviously,
even if it's something as simple as
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning a window, if you don't pay that
much attention and you don't go tight into
[SPEAKER_01]: the corners, you'll leave water droplets
in the corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you're using not a rag,
but an actual window cleaner and you leave
[SPEAKER_01]: too much of a space between cleans,
you'll actually leave a strip of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: People do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's other people that can't
do that because all they see are the
[SPEAKER_01]: imperfections.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking so hard and they're so
focused that they would never leave an
[SPEAKER_01]: imperfection like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imperfections are screaming to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cleaner they get it, the louder
the imperfection screams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Screams, you understand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Screams is kind of like a little Freudian
slip there as I'm doing a metaphor for
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning resin, but talking about cleaning
a window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, squeegee.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The squeegee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imperfections.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should use DC glass cleaner,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's happened in Samuel
Bench.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you check every plant, it depends on
how OCD you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how much attention you're
paying to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just another day getting better here,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could get my boss to understand
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure how to figure out how to
convince people to understand anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can just repeat things and
then live things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually it'll be written in
the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those people will come to you and
be like, hey, did you hear about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll be like, yeah, I've been
telling you that and living that for 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just saw it in the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's real now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of how some people are living.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not the best idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone have a good strain for bipolar,
too?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any type of those that has anxiety or
mental, where it's a feeling, where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: in your head, where you're like,
I'm sure cannabis could be good for
[SPEAKER_01]: bipolar, manic depression, all those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would definitely be like,
be careful and be wary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, don't, particularly with
bipolar, because one of the things bipolar
[SPEAKER_01]: does is you want to have a really good
support system and you want to have people
[SPEAKER_01]: that you trust and believe so that when
you go, you know, potentially if you go
[SPEAKER_01]: manic, if you go really this high end
energy, it's good to have some people that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can trust and believe who are saying,
hey, you got to come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have those people in your
life and I think it's safe to try all
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of forms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And find the one that's right for you,
but make sure that you don't get lost in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, I'm sure you know
yourself better than anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mental illnesses are always a tough one
because they're so in the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need another rip?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have another rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say no to another rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a rip and a turp dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, for sure, Chris Tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to make sure that you have
good people around you that you're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitely we know one thing and I
would not normally say this, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, my father-in-law was sick with
mental illness most of his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of those pills that were
prescribed to him, I don't really feel,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I would never really tell
anyone to not take pharmaceutical pills
[SPEAKER_01]: because to each their own, we have to look
at all the options that we have,
[SPEAKER_01]: but make sure that you do your research
and look at all the options and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's good for you and it's good for
the people around you because it is some
[SPEAKER_01]: scary shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bong wrap, mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's D420K, let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got 236 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send a little message out and we'll
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me judge your terpenes on your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, one of the easiest ways for
sure is to extract them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really shows you what you've got,
just like anything, just like the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: making.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to let, oh yeah, POV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did that go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would I like to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I like Star Wars?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if yes, who was my favorite character?
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear to God, I must've been like five
or six years old the first time I saw Star
[SPEAKER_01]: Wars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that it's gotten so complex and
there's so many different levels to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: to me, first of all, Star Wars was the
four, five, and six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back,
Return of the Jedi.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is Star Wars to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this other stuff, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It trips me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who my favorite character is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be Han Solo, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was smuggling shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was getting people the shit they needed
that the rule makers decided that they
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to like, of course Yoda's
classic, but Han Solo was smuggling shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the Millennium Falcon.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the name of his ship?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, it's true, Raymond Cowland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it might sound funny by saying
that mental illness, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so in the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I meant by that is that because
it's in your head and people can't see it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's not quite diagnosable like a
tumor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or something visual on your skin or in
your body, holding yourself a certain way,
[SPEAKER_01]: skeletal, whatever, it's tough because
people don't have the same level of
[SPEAKER_01]: compassion and empathy for people who are
sick with bipolar or manic or other mental
[SPEAKER_01]: illnesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm saying about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might sound like funny the way you
wrote it, but really I wasn't meaning it
[SPEAKER_01]: to sound funny at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was meaning it to sound very sort of
serious in the sense that if maybe we had
[SPEAKER_01]: a little more empathy and compassion for
those suffering with mental illness the
[SPEAKER_01]: way we would if someone had a giant tumor
growing out of their neck, I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: might be easier on people who are
suffering with mental illness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that, I think people are
afraid of mental illness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they're afraid of it,
they tend to sometimes be angry instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: compassionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't, I mean, that's just my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Belman, even if I have to pay,
can I set up Skype to talk to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I'm sure we could probably
do a Skype talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I don't like to try and be like the
guy who tries to charge people to talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: them, but I have an enormous amount of
people writing me messages and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one-to-one, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people who are wanting to learn and
educate, I feel like that's always going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be something I spend my time on.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when I realize that it's a
company, a commercial enterprise,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that they're doing for a living,
well, then it seems like it's fair that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a consulting gig and that there's pay
being involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you make most of your decisions out of
intuition or gut feeling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, intuition and gut feeling are
definitely there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watch for the coincidences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watch for these experiences that I
myself have for sure manifested that in my
[SPEAKER_01]: brain are like, oh, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had this happen, you know,
like things that align.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a weird sort of coincidental manner,
I see great value in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never ignore meeting anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's another kind of key
thing that if you're only trying to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: people who you think can help your agenda
and you look at them as a certain level of
[SPEAKER_01]: person and the people who are below that
you're ignoring, you're going to miss a
[SPEAKER_01]: great deal of stuff because personally,
I find the majority of the really magic
[SPEAKER_01]: that happens in my life happens from
random people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are not known or you could never
think of them at a certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just a neutral person you've never
met.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you give these people the time,
you'll see that they're actually people
[SPEAKER_01]: you manifested into your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's up to you to recognize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard to put into words,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pet Medzi and I want to share my truths
with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I do this all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then people have specific questions
that they want to ask me for their time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like I said, if it's like,
oh, I'm helping my dad try to beat his
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer or something, I'll spend hours with
that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's for a commercial enterprise,
it just seems fair that I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable talking about gardening big
squirrel nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remind me of my best friend that died.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's crazy, Andrew Burby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to hear about your best friend that
died, but I'm glad I remind you of him a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he's in here a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giving me inspirations, because I
definitely feel like wherever I'm getting
[SPEAKER_01]: my inspirations from, it's like from
another place other than me, like it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so give thanks for cannabis being one
of the most incredible facilitators of
[SPEAKER_01]: reality manifestation, a facilitator of
positivity and a facilitator of just great
[SPEAKER_01]: vibes, iry vibes, as they say in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to share some of my Jamaica photos
with you guys, man, because I was taking
[SPEAKER_01]: some today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me see where I put them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put them in the CRD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I put them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some pictures I've taken so
many years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the first two dudes that ever
made bubble, that I ever made bubble with
[SPEAKER_01]: in Jamaica now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a batch that I didn't photograph,
and then they made this batch after
[SPEAKER_01]: watching me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, check this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of them apples?
[SPEAKER_01]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the OG bubble makers right
there, James and his helper.
[SPEAKER_01]: James is on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really incredible Rastafarian man,
like totally inspirational dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get another one open for you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red is another inspirational dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show this picture of Red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see where you're at, Red.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, there's Red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure why I'm showing all this other
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of failing at this, but old
school Red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making me feel...
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if I can get the rest to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I even do with you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the chat and now, oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try one more.
Ziggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ziggy won the cannabis cup last year,
two years ago in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I wanna show you right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's Ziggy and I.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an orange hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the soil in the background is
orange with good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are a 20 gallon set of bubble
bags that I'm passing his way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be 15 years later that I would
see him on stage at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me winning best product, first place with
bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him winning first place for best bubble
hash almost 20 years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really great guy right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not Ziggy Marley.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is Ziggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mibredrin from Orange Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me give you one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Bongo Roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bongo Roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you at, Bongo?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chilling with Bongo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can't get the screen share
happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is also about 15 or 16 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chilling with Bongo Roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also giving him a set of bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a medicine man, so he was making
all sorts of different medicines from
[SPEAKER_01]: different plants and coconut oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, well, that's almost 20 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is damn near almost 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we got the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta give thanks to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were some of my original videos with
this gentleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has the dreadlocks that go down all the
way to the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like way to the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke with all these guys, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding me, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole reason they were spending time
with me and not thinking I was just some
[SPEAKER_01]: whacked out tourist is because I was there
making hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a medicine man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm teaching this Bongo Roach guy who's
like a revered medicine man in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm teaching him how to make bubble hash
and giving them bags and not asking for
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in return.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my brother, Mikey.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call him the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at his grow that's on top of a
mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in the picture he carried up on
his head, including 55 gallon drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought Remo here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought Pete Brady from Cannabis Culture
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought all sorts of people to meet with
Mikey.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just an absolute beautiful person,
grew absolute fire, and even Skunkman Sam
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked the resin and met these guys as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he loved it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the real deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the sativa days back in Jamaica
where you could actually go into a field
[SPEAKER_01]: and see a sativa or a narrow leaf drug
cultivar?
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, just sharing a little bit of
pictures with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figured it was kind of a short little wake
and bake today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long we've been on for
already, but it's probably been close to
[SPEAKER_01]: half an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll do one more dab and we'll call
it a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are going to have a good
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday tomorrow is Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do would like to tell you that you
should be there for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a good one, like a
really, really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So come to Hash Church tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start the link right after we
end this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would appreciate it if you take that
YouTube link and you share it throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: your social medias.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how many people we can get
watching live on Hash Church tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a top 10, maybe top five,
maybe top three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's saying a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been 146 episodes, but it's going
to be a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd hate for any of you to miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that it would matter because it will
be recorded and you'll be able to watch it
[SPEAKER_01]: on YouTube any time afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am giving you a hint, Octo Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, it's going to be a super
awesome episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be a hint right there enough
to tell you that you should be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in the meantime, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got 234 people watching right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everyone, for coming and
hanging out, puffing bowls with me on this
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful Saturday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's not afternoon yet, but we are in
the East Coast, then it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, this should just crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into shards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you smoking on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smoking on some Congolese rosin,
a little Congo bongo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's about to go down here
very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last email I thought you sent me,
Chase, was asking if you could send me
[SPEAKER_01]: your book and sign it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just was like, I don't want to have
the responsibility, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, if you meet me anywhere,
I think I went through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this was the email you were
referring to, I'll gladly sign something
[SPEAKER_01]: at Karma Cup or at one of the events that
I'm working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want the responsibility of my
kid destroying it or me losing it or
[SPEAKER_01]: spacing, resending it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little wheeze in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't wait to be wake and baking
from Jamaica here soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to do some good ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get prophecy to do maybe a little
wake and bake sing song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even Richie Spice would do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he's sure talented as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great to have either one of
those guys come on the wake and bake show
[SPEAKER_01]: and play a little song for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to ask them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it'll be too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such good vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such good vibes on him there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly love Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly, truly, truly love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlimited amounts, dicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlimited amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait until that greenhouse is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, everybody, thanks for coming in
today and sharing your time with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did receive your email.
[SPEAKER_01]: He who won the prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't I leave you with,
may the full melt bless your bowl sooner
[SPEAKER_01]: than later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk to you then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me a lot.
You got me a lot.
