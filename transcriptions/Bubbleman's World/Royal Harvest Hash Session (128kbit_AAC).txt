[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
literally we're sitting on my deck here in
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful Lions Bay BC and I'm here with
Kevin from Royal Harvest and First of all,
[SPEAKER_02]: good to see you dude as always brother He
drove up from the Okanagan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a good four or five hour drive
for you That's about a five hour drive
[SPEAKER_04]: this morning, but a beautiful drive and
worth it every time so Kevin and I linked
[SPEAKER_02]: up Through book club.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had an event at book club where he
brought a bunch of his flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you tell them about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I ended up getting introduced to all
doffle there at book club and we started
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about bringing some flour in As I
got involved with the book club chat I
[SPEAKER_04]: noticed that Marcus had reached out with
some interest of looking in to see what my
[SPEAKER_04]: flour could do So we ended up coordinating
a time came down here had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: He taught me I've always been about the
flour I started this at a very young age
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 I'm in a necessity to help family and
I've been focused on really trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: generate and create the best flour I can
so it was very interesting when Marcus
[SPEAKER_04]: reached out to me in regards to making
some hash So I was more than excited to
[SPEAKER_04]: come down bring him some of my flour and
he Showed me the process a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: making some hash and I think we actually
came up with some absolutely Nice product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you think well we have many many
jars sitting over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say about 30 or 28 At least 25 to 30
jars of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran three different varieties a hundred
grams of each so Well below the threshold
[SPEAKER_02]: of the five gallon bubble now and five
gallon bubble bag kit We ran it through
[SPEAKER_02]: the eight bags through the labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it here at my house and
unfortunately we didn't Film that video.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of work to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just noticing as well I didn't wipe
the table, but you know what that's okay
[SPEAKER_02]: The table isn't the focus today the
hashish is the focus so This hash is the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time we're gonna be smoking this
we're gonna check melt tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our puff Co and our focus Carta
2 You are on and I am on so it's just a
[SPEAKER_02]: matter of lighting them up Oh one thing I
will go get which will be very important
[SPEAKER_02]: and shout out to buoy from glob mops is
Some q-tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm learning I'm new to the extracts and
doing it this way, but they're necessity
[SPEAKER_02]: to clean every time Yeah, you don't want
to be not cleaning and then shut it to
[SPEAKER_02]: apex ancillary as well They sent me this
cool little Kit and we'll be using this
[SPEAKER_02]: one today for you Amazing and shout out to
mystic timber for the little scoop for me
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be using that one for me,
and I'm gonna go get the q-tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be right back All right got the XL
glob mops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find these ones with the wood To be
better better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they just don't snap as easy so look
at that just perfection shout out the buoy
[SPEAKER_02]: for that and I guess if you want to pull
in some flavors here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can start loading up some Show it to
Calix to for hooking me up with the jars
[SPEAKER_02]: Got us some great jars there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the 90 micron red velvet runs
Absolutely insane it looks like diamonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's insane Hmm very very nice all
right well Load up a little oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's melting in the sand dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Guess what I'm gonna.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do is just do that To dab out on oh man
look how Sticky yeah, that is insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you definitely Look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even get it off my stick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a good
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not allowed these to grease out at
all they've been in the freezer since
[SPEAKER_02]: production well They wait they dried at a
cold ambient temperature out of the Sun
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the lights and then right into jars
right into the freezer at minus 21 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: Celsius so I guess what we do is you'll
hit this top button twice And then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: just look and we'll watch for the melt
factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll share with this With you on a
different video.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you guys can see the melt factor
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's use mountain Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, that's that's full mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's full mouth Yeah, mine's boiling up
to very nicely
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow what flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a little sweat, but beating on my
forehead there I Only had mine on the
[SPEAKER_02]: second heat seed setting as well as green
All
[SPEAKER_02]: right now a little check on the chas
Always gonna be something left.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why someone turned it into
Full melt is when it leaves nothing on the
[SPEAKER_02]: nail that really wasn't a part of the
definition of full mouth in the beginning
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly if it leaves nothing on the
nail that is the highest caliber of full
[SPEAKER_02]: mouth Since a tiny little bit of chas
probably in the like one to two percent
[SPEAKER_02]: range of what got put in So not too bad at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the 90 micron red velvet runs The
first one we tried now we did go with the
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 to the Upping our our potential
possibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't help it though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks so nice in the jar that it was
calling my name It really did look nice in
[SPEAKER_04]: the jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked great in the pipe, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely We both hit very
different size Rips you hit quite a big
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit a much smaller one probably half
size but still got the Full melt effect
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes with melt the more you put in
the more it will appear to melt Whereas if
[SPEAKER_02]: you put a smaller amount in you won't see
quite a violent melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had still a very nice violent melt and
we'll Make some videos for you guys to see
[SPEAKER_02]: that here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to clean you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it already I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all process
[SPEAKER_04]: You learn that when you use your bubble
bags make sure in between you're taking
[SPEAKER_04]: the client time to clean those bags
perfectly every time it reduces the
[SPEAKER_02]: effectiveness of The bags, you know
They'll start plugging with resin as you
[SPEAKER_02]: leave that resin behind and don't clean it
and it just ends up being a bummer That's
[SPEAKER_02]: unnecessary an unnecessary bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go Wow, that was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about your red velvet
runs red velvet runs it's I got the cut
[SPEAKER_04]: actually from a buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Don't know too much about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just started running and playing with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting great yields and very good
returns off it That's nice looking flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's absolutely a stunner.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just completely caked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does Miss every time beautiful smoke
beautiful flavor and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it brings that quality clean smoke every
time Is it one of the pictures that you
[SPEAKER_02]: had sent and shared with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember like one in particular
that was very like light It was a lavender
[SPEAKER_02]: ash color almost the entire bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may have I'll know that is the Fritter
mitts Oh the Fritter mitts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that one yet Not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's just getting ready to head
to processing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Well right before we sat down for
this we got a shot We got a message from
[SPEAKER_02]: Adolfo saying that he's having a special
hash night on the 28th of this month
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely couldn't be a better time for
that now that we have some hash to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: no and think about the Timeline of make it
like, you know, it's probably take a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple weeks or a week to plan such an
event But imagine you had to grow an
[SPEAKER_02]: entire crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to turn it into hash Yeah,
we had to dry the hash properly then jar
[SPEAKER_02]: it up and only after all of that when we
prepared to get that Message and when did
[SPEAKER_02]: we get that message about like 20 seconds
after we sat down and I put these jars in
[SPEAKER_04]: You were scraping pretty much the last
Slimer hash off the box and you got that
[SPEAKER_04]: message, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like how does it work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to pull my macro camera out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did Microplane these so the heads are
gonna be pretty shredded in that sense
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't be the same beautiful round
heads that you usually see but I'll try to
[SPEAKER_02]: do some macro photography on these to show
a That you can dry bubble on a pizza box
[SPEAKER_02]: and not get fibers in the hash I mean you
did not see a single fiber with the naked
[SPEAKER_02]: eye Cleanest can be wouldn't you sort of
see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But if not, I'll go in with my extremely
extremely powerful macro lens and show you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys one more time that If done properly,
there's no reason you should be pulling
[SPEAKER_02]: any fibers off of the cardboard This is
also specifically for people in tropical
[SPEAKER_02]: countries or in the Pacific Northwest in
Washington, Oregon, British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have very high humidity is not now I'll
admit no not now, but it is extremely hot
[SPEAKER_02]: out right now We have very high humidity
for about eight months of the year nine
[SPEAKER_02]: months of the year So to try and dry hash
without a freeze dryer in an air drying
[SPEAKER_02]: method It becomes very very very difficult
to do So we've learned this over the years
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was telling people you need to use
a desiccant you need to Use something to
[SPEAKER_02]: pull the moisture out of the hash and
nicotine was being like you don't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: do that at all You just put it on
parchment and it'll it'll work fine,
[SPEAKER_02]: which it you know to me I was like he
doesn't know what he's talking about to
[SPEAKER_02]: him He was like he doesn't know what I'm
talking about and then eventually we put
[SPEAKER_02]: it together that you know our terroirs
We're affecting our ability to dry hash
[SPEAKER_02]: and remember when you're making hash as
long as you follow the directions quite
[SPEAKER_02]: simply This is all very simple when you
get to the hard part is when you have The
[SPEAKER_02]: wet bubble and now it's the part that
involves removing as much moisture or
[SPEAKER_02]: water content from that hash as possible
And then getting it broken up into a way
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can actually properly dry it and
not everyone has freeze dryers So this
[SPEAKER_02]: video is in particularly right now Talking
to those of you who are home hash makers
[SPEAKER_02]: home growers who don't have freeze dryers
who don't have a budget for a three to
[SPEAKER_02]: five thousand dollar freeze dryer There
are ways to safely dry your hash depending
[SPEAKER_04]: on where you are And how long does it take
them to dry their hash that way compared
[SPEAKER_02]: to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can always test it and I suggest
that you do test it by putting it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment that you feel is the correct
environment to do the drying and then
[SPEAKER_02]: Accessing it after a couple days or three
days or four days or five days Because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really like an intuition to know if
you take the hash And you put it away with
[SPEAKER_02]: any moisture in it that moisture is going
to cause Problems down the line,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially or really only if you're not
putting it in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely If you're gonna expose it to
you know room temperatures especially in
[SPEAKER_02]: the hot summer If there's any moisture in
there, it's and and you'll learn it very
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a funky smell You know, I have people
sometimes are convinced.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's just the smell of my genetics
and I'm like In all hash that's been You
[SPEAKER_04]: get the same thing with flour when it's
you know, they're almost there but they go
[SPEAKER_04]: to cure before you get that Smell that
it's like it was just too much was left.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a fine line Yes, there's a fine
line and it's almost an instinct that you
[SPEAKER_04]: develop over time to know where that fine
line is Right to really get that
[SPEAKER_04]: difference of that high quality Well,
I guess we're gonna have another sip of
[SPEAKER_04]: water and try another another flavor All
right
[SPEAKER_02]: by now you've probably noticed things have
shifted I pushed pause on the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a phenomenal dab We just enjoyed
a really nice off-camera conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty baked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, but we're ready for Another
variety which is the Slimer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what can you tell us about the Slimer?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Slimer is a Tiva dominant hybrid
Definitely can smell the turpinoline in
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You bet you it's about a 60-40 Very nice
buzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has that very nice as you said that
turpa just hit you When we were making it
[SPEAKER_04]: you could just smell it coming out of the
washer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it really was It was I hate that
though as well as love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it because it smells Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it because I want it to stay in the
resin I don't it's funny how you know
[SPEAKER_02]: sometime I had something in Germany some
honey bananas really nice rosin and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing it was so loud but it was so loud
that I just kept opening the jar and
[SPEAKER_02]: letting everyone smell it like a hundred
times more than I do to any normal jar of
[SPEAKER_02]: anything and It started to dissipate a
little and I remember a friend opening it
[SPEAKER_02]: going And then doing it three or four
times in a row and feeling like I mean I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't because there was another side of
me that I would was more focused on which
[SPEAKER_02]: was like Enjoying what he was enjoying
exactly through him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like and that's a great feeling
Yeah, it's about the experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same with my flower What I do it
for is the experience that the person gets
[SPEAKER_04]: on the other end when they open that Bag
and they smell it and then they want to
[SPEAKER_04]: smell it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: You squish it and smell it, you know It's
all about the experience and then you know
[SPEAKER_04]: You take that with flower with hash and
it's an amazing when you get to this kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of caliber of your hash You get that
caliber of experience, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: True.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah true I gotta hit this thing again on
top twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah every time but not yet
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, you can load it up It's kind of a
funky mess A little bit less sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see how she does
[SPEAKER_02]: Think I hit it right did you hit it twice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look on the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll show you is it is the temperature
rising?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's turned off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to hit it five times There you
go Twice and then twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she blows
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells and tastes so good way less
melty but really tasty I'm terpina lean
[SPEAKER_02]: like that's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the slimer I think the slimer would be
better as a pressed hash I think if this
[SPEAKER_02]: was pressed into hash and let cure for a
while that it would be we should do it
[SPEAKER_02]: actually with a bit Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could also press rosin out of it to
gain a melt factor Which we also have the
[SPEAKER_04]: ability to do So much you can do with a
hash a oh, yeah, it's interesting it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just there's a small percentage of it that
is just Meant for melt Make
[SPEAKER_02]: some shade for that hash Yeah,
so also a very nice flavor like beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: completely different from the first one
much lighter because I didn't put as much
[SPEAKER_02]: in mine as I put in yours and it didn't
have quite the melt effect I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: would still be probably a 50 to 60 percent
return on rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, which isn't terrible I think that
full melt that we hit would probably be
[SPEAKER_02]: like a 85 percent plus Which at that point
once you're getting into the 85 plus 90
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of like Is there any necessity
to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's melting like the way it was
Really nice flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suspect we're gonna end up doing a lot
more myself and Kevin yeah Collaboration
[SPEAKER_02]: so we'll end up running some more of his
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has so many genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous and like he mentioned
earlier He never came from this From a
[SPEAKER_02]: hash perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been a grower perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, which is awesome Yeah, so I mean
it's great to learn that what I'm putting
[SPEAKER_04]: into my program and what I do reflects
into the hash You know I another person
[SPEAKER_04]: that approached and you and everybody
seems to be getting great results so that
[SPEAKER_04]: means a lot to me because Not just my
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want it to be able to resonate through
the whole industry through every aspect So
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what like I said better flower
better product on the deal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exactly how it works for sure
and Yeah, I look forward to running some
[SPEAKER_02]: other cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had some really nice Jars today here
that we'll show you in a bit What was it
[SPEAKER_02]: was frosted fruitcake and sherbo and
sherbo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, both beautiful both very different
in looks and structure and profiles
[SPEAKER_02]: Entering into the unicorn cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they are so I wanted to bring two
completely different flowers again,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is what was ready, but Out of my
rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to bring a Completely different
look to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they go into a store, they have
Varieties of multiple, you know great
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors offer that for certain in fact as
much as I want to show you those flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna show those flowers We'll make
a part two to this video with those
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers all nice and close up in the Sun
which I'll do the video for today because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're so very specific looking buds and
The unicorn cup is an anonymous entry,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not okay, well then we can show the
flowers if it was anonymous I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: feel good about no Royal Harvest is So
when when but okay you're entering but
[SPEAKER_02]: when he gives out the samples,
whoa, I don't know there So we'll find
[SPEAKER_02]: that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I'm pretty sure it's gonna be
what I thought initially and if that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: case We'll show the flowers in part two of
this video as well as announce the winners
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's pretty exciting just to be part
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a special year for it first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really making it a boat wreck As
you know, I've come from pretty much a
[SPEAKER_04]: lifetime of legacy market and it's great
and almost exciting for the first year of
[SPEAKER_04]: The cup being part of a wreck is my first
year being able to be part of this amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: industry So it's kind of everything's a
blessing, you know, it's all exciting
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff coming down the pipe I'm excited
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to go to the unicorn cup and
I'll definitely film at least two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: videos at the unicorn cup maybe some Chat
fireside chats that we did last year with
[SPEAKER_02]: the group, which was really good and maybe
some paddle boarding with my bro out on
[SPEAKER_02]: the Lake absolutely, but late Tyler Ty
shout out to Ty All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, listen That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both those ribs got me completely
elevated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not good at sitting in the direct
sunlight So long, so so we're gonna go do
[SPEAKER_02]: something more fun than this, but we're
happy to have shared some time with you
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely props to Kevin and you as well
Yes Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks everybody You You You You You
