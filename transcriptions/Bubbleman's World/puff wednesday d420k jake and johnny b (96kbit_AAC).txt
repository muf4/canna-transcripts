[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
and welcome to puff Wednesday,
[SPEAKER_03]: is it puff Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, fucking rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad I didn't put my 120 shirt on today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is a 120 day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot box DNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a new one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam party.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an oldie.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to help John grab some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to bring it upstairs and then
we're going to show you what we got.
[SPEAKER_05]: My car just started.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're making it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, welcome to bubble man's world
everybody and welcome to puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B just got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you saw, I graded him at the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a bunch of fun stuff to bring up
and he's going to tell us about the
[SPEAKER_03]: prairie cup in Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot of fun sitting there with
full melt steel and that caught my eye.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was smiling and I was like, what the
fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a microphone thing I didn't know
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got his dab tool full of bubble line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steel tool just loaded with fresh rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm next.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: A double bong rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from the mothership rate into that,
if I'm correct, the Nate Dizzle Swiss
[SPEAKER_05]: perk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dripping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that clear dome on the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a beautiful night.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing we forgot to bring out,
carb cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feeling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got D420K showing up later for a
late night puff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday be very, very, very,
very.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say be very, very careful
when pulling out a tie nail from someone's
[SPEAKER_03]: bong, particularly a mothership.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now people that own motherships are very
particular because they spent the kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: money on them and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever Flav or even if a row is by,
I always let them do it just because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: theirs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's such an easy thing to chip this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I took it out and made it seem
pretty loose and got you so comfortable,
[SPEAKER_03]: you started pulling it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have been playing with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be all of a minute later that you
go to put it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Titanium is very hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just have to tap the glass and
you'll chip it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just keep it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I got John a little comfortable
there being so loose with my unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: With glass, might as well just.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I've learned about glass breaking
is that it's best if the owner breaks it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In all my years of owning glass,
I find that if the owner breaks it,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's your best case scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else breaks glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what it's like to break glass
because.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what it's like to have
glass broken.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my Prairie Cup got broken.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Took it to the Prairie Cup and it got
knocked off a table.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, accidents happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being fixed, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: John Glass is fixing her up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with a piece like this is it's
not really fixable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fixable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really that you could fix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could just replace the cost of it,
which is like who wants to break someone's
[SPEAKER_03]: mothership?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is an interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think about smoking heady
glass with people?
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens if you break their piece?
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you chip their piece?
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you do something that they
wouldn't have done and their piece gets
[SPEAKER_03]: broken?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the responsibility?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, if it's a hundred dollar
piece, I guess we try to fix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe even if it's a couple of hundred
dollar piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you really replace like a twenty
five thousand dollar piece if you break
[SPEAKER_03]: it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think best not touch it otherwise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we are honored enough to be sitting
with people that we know that let us puff
[SPEAKER_05]: on thirty, forty, fifty thousand dollar
bongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And around that, it's like the bongs
handed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I take things for advantage when
I'm sitting here with you all the time
[SPEAKER_05]: because I'm always puffing on this
mothership.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, even the way I did it, if we watch
the video, the way I did it so loose,
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you in the video we could see you
watching me do that and have the
[SPEAKER_03]: realization I could do that because it was
less than twenty five seconds later that
[SPEAKER_03]: you had this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course you were going to do a double.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tough one where it's you know,
it's like especially with a piece like
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Nate Dissel gave me this piece on a
trip that him, myself, Steve Hopps and a
[SPEAKER_03]: few other people were on this trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met them in Amsterdam at the airport.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took them to Amsterdam and drove them to
Germany, to the Frankenthal, the city of
[SPEAKER_03]: Frankenthal, which is basically where the
Ruhr factory is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did collaborations together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nate Dissel gave me this piece as a sort
of thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Nate does not like the Rastafarian
color scheme.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a color scheme he rarely ever does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was kind of cool that he did it for
this particular situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's definitely a nice piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when I was first hitting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we'd love to hear about your
comments in what you guys think about
[SPEAKER_03]: glass and sharing glass and what the
etiquette is.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the common knowledge etiquette?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for me, the common knowledge is
simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I break someone's piece, I replace it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I either pay them the money value or,
you know, offering to fix the piece
[SPEAKER_03]: nowadays isn't as big of a help as you
might think because the piece might hold a
[SPEAKER_03]: particular value.
[SPEAKER_03]: That value will be extremely affected if
not completely lost when someone else
[SPEAKER_03]: touches the piece and fixes it,
especially if they fix it, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in a way that doesn't really give credence
to the piece, which I've seen on a few
[SPEAKER_03]: occasions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pieces that were fixed and I was just
like, oh, almost shouldn't have fixed
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I think etiquette would be if
you break a piece of glass, if the owner
[SPEAKER_05]: of the guy that blew the glass can't fix
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then, I mean, I don't know if it
would go on from somebody else if that
[SPEAKER_05]: would be the decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, personally, if you break a
bond, you got to be responsible for that
[SPEAKER_03]: bond.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tough one, especially when you're
playing around with, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a particular tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have a group of people,
it's almost like a class, like there's
[SPEAKER_03]: different classes of people in the bond
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people that are puffing on $50,000
bonds and then there's people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: literally puffing on like broccoli pipes
that they made in their dorm room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I support both of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you give the guy with the broccoli
pipe a $50,000 piece to hit?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcel did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know others that do on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know others that don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear what you guys have to
think about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always happy to give people the
benefit of the doubt and pass a piece of
[SPEAKER_03]: this over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I was very also eager to be like,
even as I was pulling this out,
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought to myself, John is going to do
this in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I knew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, that's why I was like, no,
no, no, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just such a strong, I can't wait to
get the courts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit I'm, I'm done with the
titanium.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hitting it mostly because it's what I
have, you know, so I've been talking to
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian from D nail and they're hooking up
some new whips, some new prototype bolts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and Sapphire dishes and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be able to try those things out,
give you guys the overview maybe in the up
[SPEAKER_03]: and coming puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you feeling?
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to get that Swiss rip in?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Swiss rip yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I've been, um, so let's get you that
Swiss rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now each time I put it in, I'm like,
what's the dry sift over there,
[SPEAKER_03]: my friend?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same as what's on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I was tasting.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some on the dabber there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: By all means dab it up on this beautiful
sunny day.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are a few plants, Congolese that got
a little too tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we're a little too hot in the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I went to Jamaica those couple of
times, I wasn't really able to care for
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I pulled them out and put them on my
deck.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're producing beautiful resin and
they've got about a 12 to 20 inch nugget
[SPEAKER_03]: on each one of them, a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they should make a nice wash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that'll be a Congo run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, just do the whole two Congo plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's an amazing idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will vote yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes on that vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime, clean that dabber
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not quite.
[SPEAKER_05]: See my throat's a little agitated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying not to cough because
coughing is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you watch our videos?
[SPEAKER_03]: The next video I'm going to do is just
going to be John's coughing for all of our
[SPEAKER_03]: videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do like a split.
[SPEAKER_05]: We already did me dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome though.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good dab out session.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good dab out session.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean jet lag and killer hash dab me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what just happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were running around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a high, uh, it's a, it's a high,
um, bar to keep up with where it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: like nonstop constantly from one place to
the next.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's try that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's John not coughing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a little bit of an agitated throat.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was because I was testing 27 strains
in a period of basically 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we were at the Prairie Harvest Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how did you find the strains for the
most part?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some good strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of stuff that should never
been entered that was not organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you're entering into any kind
of a cup, if it isn't organic,
[SPEAKER_05]: why even bother to be honest?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the flavor is just, you can really
taste it and stuff, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody's got the good gardening
techniques and, uh, some just want to
[SPEAKER_05]: enter into a cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it was very, very visual with
some of the entries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just like, why the even enter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't it be nice if the cannabis cups
were different in the sense that you still
[SPEAKER_03]: got to inflate your own ego, uh,
by growing or processing the best hash or
[SPEAKER_03]: herb by winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the judges were actually people who
were sick using cannabis medicinally,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they were given a three to five day
period where you sent all the samples to
[SPEAKER_03]: their homes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got real feedback, real,
like sort of what's the medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: true person feedback that was,
that was telling you, yeah, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I found that it would be, it was be so
powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: To hear someone be like, you know,
I'm just looking to relieve my glaucoma
[SPEAKER_03]: and that it worked great or it caused an
appetite stimulant, or maybe there was
[SPEAKER_03]: chemicals and they didn't like the
harshness on their throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like their voice would be so much,
so much stronger and it would make cups
[SPEAKER_03]: such a better thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that was the outcome, you could
somehow, how did we do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but it sure would be a cool
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee you, no one's thinking about
doing it that out of the 500 people that
[SPEAKER_03]: are planning to do cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the whole thing is, is like July
1st, we always talk about this cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: day is all about medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you were going to hold any kind of
cup, I think it should be based around
[SPEAKER_05]: medical and it should be based around
medicine and having medical patients that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're talking about being able to
actually judge strains that work for their
[SPEAKER_05]: condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that way we can find out what
strains are working for different
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The result would be more valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you actually finish it with
that information rather than the results
[SPEAKER_03]: of, Oh, the lemon OG Kush one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to go buy lemon OG Kush seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even in chat yesterday, I did a chat
and I, you know, some young guys from out
[SPEAKER_03]: East are like, I just want to move out
West, but I can't even get 2,500 a pound
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, listen, you guys are
completely on the wrong page with that
[SPEAKER_03]: worrying about the price of, you know,
cannabis will take care of you if you
[SPEAKER_03]: require it to, but not in that prohibition
model of like growing it and selling it
[SPEAKER_03]: for like a really high price.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love to see it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the number two Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was getting it from my friend
Justin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back two years ago and put your bubble
next to this bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bubble you had two years ago that you
were like happy with.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell were you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have absolutely no idea what it was
because for the most part, bags are going
[SPEAKER_03]: to make it pure for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, maybe you weren't drying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you were over mixing it because I'm
telling you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was 110% the old days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody was using beaters.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were all getting on our half inch
drills with our big drill bits in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't grown different pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't change the way you grew pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's powerful to see that you were
like, cause really that bubble was not
[SPEAKER_03]: like what I recall.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I talked to people about one thing
that I realized is, is using an eight bag
[SPEAKER_05]: system completely was the game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's a big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The drying techniques, not just like
chunks.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, properly freezing it right away or,
you know, there's, there's, I like fresh
[SPEAKER_05]: frozen variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: The variable here is, is everything I make
now is fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas before he's to dry out the herb,
use the sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was just me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was, I was using the sugar leaf should
still produce a beautiful quality though.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't just, it was the variables that
you were missing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to take all my garbage to try
and make something amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've got something amazing now,
John.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all your bubble is a nine out of
10.
Easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it great that we, it's just a matter
of variables, you know, like I kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: always thought that the real hard part was
growing the weed and it's definitely the
[SPEAKER_03]: more variable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I talk so much about how each
different micron smells and the different
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be really nice to see looking at the
different terpenes that are involved in
[SPEAKER_05]: the 73 90 and the 120 with the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe someone out there has got a machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Different cannabinoid profiles too,
not just terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's this particular done in
the labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and it has to be done in the labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, look at today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Minister Golding, props.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice to see if you guys aren't on
the up and up of this, I will put the link
[SPEAKER_03]: to the Gleamer, the Jamaican Gleamer or
the Observer in the comment section of
[SPEAKER_03]: this video.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go click on it and read about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, Jamaica has written amendments
to their laws because they are part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: 61 Peace Treaty Narcotics Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't just change the laws
completely, but they can amend them and
[SPEAKER_03]: they've amended for like import,
export, medical, transport.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're letting people out of jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're extinguishing criminal records.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_05]: A hundred percent of what's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, people that are in jail or be
charged for marijuana simply possession
[SPEAKER_05]: charges and stuff like that are now
basically free.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happening everywhere and you know,
the world is changing all around this
[SPEAKER_05]: plant and that's just awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really props to Jamaica and all my
Jamaican friends and family over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys really earned this one,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy Moses.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: You brought a couple of toys over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we show a few things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at how beautiful the sunlight is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually, that box that is probably
sitting in the side over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out of the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember I told you I moved it so they
couldn't see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can pull it in there and be,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this box is something new that I can
open her up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can open it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, there's been gifts that have
been granted to a few of us to take a look
[SPEAKER_05]: at a new product.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not really going to...
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, this particular product is a
product, it's different, but it's another
[SPEAKER_03]: LED.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new form of LED.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let John kind of tell you about it in
a minute here, but for those right away
[SPEAKER_03]: when I mention this, they're going to be
like, whatever happened to your 2XL
[SPEAKER_03]: Dominator?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble Man, what happened to your Lush
Light?
[SPEAKER_03]: My Lush Light was in a tent during the
summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't able to care for the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was away on trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife was very pregnant and has other
children and was busy trying to take care
[SPEAKER_03]: of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically they stretched out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't bloom when they were supposed
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've taken them all out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've cleaned the tent right up and I'm
waiting for the cooler weather and every
[SPEAKER_03]: day just seems to be epically beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that sometime in October
I'll be able to light the tents back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I'll get both my LED
lights going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point I'll let John tell you a
little bit about this particular LED
[SPEAKER_03]: light, even though he is taking a bond
grip right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this particular LED light.
[SPEAKER_05]: A for one, it works on a 400 watt power
supply.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got two drivers in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a complete closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this here, which is so cool,
closed loop, I guess the best way,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can see it's got a closed loop system
here that cools the whole system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two drivers on the top that work into a
120.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just plug it right in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what we've read and what we've
seen, it gives basically the same power as
[SPEAKER_05]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all has to do with the deflection of
the LED light in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met the guy as well and he had a little
light monitor and he was showing the
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers and basically testing the sun and
then testing the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely seemed that the numbers were
as high I'm not going to go out on a limb
[SPEAKER_03]: and say that it was scientific fact.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what we were looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Johnny brought me one over and I'll
definitely figure out a way to get this
[SPEAKER_03]: into my tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll have to grow some real little
tiny little plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll do a little sea green over this
LED light or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it shows more lumens than a thousand
watt and it shows it's brighter than the
[SPEAKER_05]: sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to wear some pretty hardcore glasses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Method 7 for sure will be getting my hands
on a pair of the LED ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got my LED Method 7.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thank Paul and James for Method 7.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for these brand new Coop HPS
Pluses with the Zeiss glass lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much stronger than the plastic lenses that
they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I thank you for those ones as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gifts for the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_05]: This gift happens to be
[SPEAKER_03]: the little bong that fits on the Apex pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get my Apex battery and plug it
in here ASAP.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great little concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little bubbler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little mini bubbler that fits on the Apex
pen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fits on a few pens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course you can see that I've been using
mine like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the battery right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the battery right there John.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this actually fits directly on the Apex
which is handy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of picked it up from a gentleman
when I was at the Prairie Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fits real nice on the Apex.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nicer than a long kind of pen
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that you can kind of hold it in
your hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you don't have to carry a torch
with you or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been hitting mine like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have mine all geared up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: These look like you've been puffing an
earl.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been puffing the shit out of
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puffing the shit out of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it a big earl cup?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you find that there was a lot more
earl than most things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Earl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Earl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where people... No this is all bubble
trash dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all 90 micro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: No I mean at the cup though where
people... Lots of shadows around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was pretty much... There was another guy
that had full melt bulbs.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sat in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was handing it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being very generous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course anybody that came by my booth
was able to sample all the cushions and
[SPEAKER_05]: the water around that I had.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Props to Stew.
[SPEAKER_05]: He totally hooked it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had little lights around there and he
made it look all nice and awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: He brought a little microscope from a lot
of drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wicked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Showing people the resin close right up
and taking pictures and people were able
[SPEAKER_05]: to smell that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smell the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smell the different terpies.
[SPEAKER_05]: People love smelling the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really start understanding it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I give them a rip and they went over to
Stew and then Stew got into more of the
[SPEAKER_05]: education on the bags and why and I was
more with the terpies and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I had it with a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that's great to hear that the fourth
annual Prairie Cup went off without a
[SPEAKER_03]: hitch and everyone had a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have to maybe check that one out next
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well maybe we should go have a session
somewhere random.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well this is where we ended up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't left.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't fucking moved.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we decided we would share a little bit
more video.
[SPEAKER_03]: 420 nice hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah you like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just picked up 420 on Puff Wednesday
and I think it just happened that way
[SPEAKER_05]: mysteriously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah D420K and Jake are heading down
from PG.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be going to meet them in a
little bit at the Salmon House on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll bring the camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll show you the view from the Salmon
House on the Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a big session out on the outer
deck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some apex pen hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely looking forward to the Salmon
House on the Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of my favorite restaurants in all
of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never been excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chef is on point and the food is
always really delicious and the view is
[SPEAKER_03]: all basically Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say you're talking about
something so delicious was that Ninja Dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that Ninja Dab was an amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like you need to be a Ninja Dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take a Ninja Dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I'm going to hit it out of the
mothership.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to transfer over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Transfer over.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah it was about the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about the food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry I interrupted you.
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get a flavor of that type of
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do a quick clean of this
because that reclaim comes off instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could see that it was fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freshly dripping down the pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe just give this one a real quick
clean too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always keep your tools clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you recently were talking about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes we were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to keep them clean all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that's kind of why I did the grunge
off video.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a bunch of haters on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh that's the worst advertising I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't trying to advertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just showing you how I clean my
bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not like trying to clean it so
it's gallery clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh I think what some people should really
realize is the reason why we do and post
[SPEAKER_05]: things that we like is because it's what
we like.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not advertising.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stuff that we enjoy using.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stuff that works.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always just say if it works for me
I'm going to tell you because I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when companies are paying us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's paying me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh that was a rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't even finish it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah that was a Ninja Dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that nice?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Brandon Dabflies for the maple
can of candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B just passed that on to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the grape one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry that was the 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking we're just going to continue
down this road of puffing ourselves into a
[SPEAKER_03]: coma.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking about Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really excited for them there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just read that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cultivate, import, export,
harvest, research and development,
[SPEAKER_03]: transport, sell for medical and
experimental purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica just blew it right out of the park
today with that news.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going right to your Facebook
page.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright we'll go right to the main,
right where it's the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it took a few seconds to load on
my page.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going in the direction to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right to the gleaner but even that took a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did the same thing where it showed this
and then in about five seconds it'll show
[SPEAKER_03]: you the article.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically what we're talking about here
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you read it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I'll just read the one part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the Minister of Justice,
Mark Golding, the Justice Minister.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're making changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're amending their act.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay so.
[SPEAKER_03]: While the Dangerous Drugs Act and its
regulations in the Food and Drug
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulations of 75 provide a regime for the
use of extracts, tinctures or preparations
[SPEAKER_03]: made from cannabis, the prohibition of the
Dangerous Drugs Act can make any dealing
[SPEAKER_03]: with the ganja plant itself illegal
without exception and therefore do not
[SPEAKER_03]: allow locally grown cannabis plants to be
used to produce extract tinctures or
[SPEAKER_03]: preparation for medical, scientific or any
other purposes, he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stating that the term of the proposed
licenses are to be determined,
[SPEAKER_03]: Golding said, We need to now flesh out the
specifics of the license and frameworks to
[SPEAKER_03]: go hand in hand once the amendments have
been approved and implemented.
[SPEAKER_03]: A licensing authority is to be established
to govern the licensing process for
[SPEAKER_03]: participation in the medical ganja
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically what he's saying is,
if I can find the one beautiful part of
[SPEAKER_03]: what he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh here it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That among the amendments to the act,
the cabinet has approved our provisions
[SPEAKER_03]: for permits to cultivate, possess,
import, export, transport, manufacture,
[SPEAKER_03]: sell and distribute ganja for medical and
scientific purposes under license.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two thumbs up Jamaica, I support you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to share that again and like
I said the article it's on it's on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Gleaner, gleaner.com in Jamaica and we'll
post it in the comments.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've stepped it up like Chili's gone to
medical and we've looked at Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: Uruguay did their thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uruguay did their thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Italy the Italian army is going to
be going to medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: States are jumping on board every other.
[SPEAKER_05]: States are jumping on board.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it's it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just seeing this plant actually make
some dramatic and some awesome changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Richie Spice would say, you got to free
up the herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to free it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Free up the herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're freeing it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to have to free some of
this resin though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to free some up as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll catch you guys in a bit at the
Salmon House on the hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright guys so we have made it to the
world famous Salmon House on the hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alder grilled fresh seafood it says
underneath.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bring the camera in and I'll let you
guys see as we enter and you can kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: check out the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is truly one of my favorite
restaurants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real beautiful view of just on the other
side of the hedges in front of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically all of downtown Vancouver as far
as like new Westminster and the endowment
[SPEAKER_03]: lands where UBC is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course we beat Darren and Jake here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought the right thing to do would
be to dab it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime there's just like
hilarious okay what is that a brand new
[SPEAKER_05]: LR4 HSE.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the Land Rovers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah it's a nice car.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can honestly say that I've never even
knew this place existed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm super stoked to go in and have a nice
meal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be nice to definitely relax.
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy some salmon of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm going to have here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had salmon earlier at Joey's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh that one's empty too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're down to like oh here's a little bit
of dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh I didn't even bring mine in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: No don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have mine right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll definitely have to grab some for the
after-sush once Darren gets here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just need to have a.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh is that ever a.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Duck on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's stuck on there good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is isn't it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I figured we got to have a dab out in
front of the salmon house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also of course brought the pure hash
joint at any point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured you know we might all probably
right after our meal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should stand on top of that
can.
[SPEAKER_03]: No it'll be right out in front on their
deck of our table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh we have a deck table outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: No we have a table inside and then there's
a deck outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you go from your table inside outside
to the deck and that's where we'll have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we'll have our puff.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right so this is probably bigger than
it needs to be but that's how I'm feeling
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a bigger one than it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that's very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's the boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: D420K and Jake C in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gonna probably jump in the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Driving the big 350.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what a long drive down for Prince
George.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of nice that they happen to be
able to come by and they do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It involves work stuff like that which is
nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just torture up that nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of waiting for these guys to get out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of want to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them to see me hitting the rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I can wait for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see a door opening yet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get the exhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have to catch the next one.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gonna have to catch the exhale.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I heard a door slam.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So of course always full milk quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a brief silence there for the
heavenly bubbly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And does that taste nice?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they see us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey D!
[SPEAKER_03]: D420K!
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if he hears that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime I'm gonna heat you up your
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without burning you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't burn me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't burn you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even any heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tried burning me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No I did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tried burning me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No hey listen if I try to burn you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be burned right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have a burn on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have a burn mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a
picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of us hitting this with his truck in the
background.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sending him a pic.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how we pull things off right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
Ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go sir Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep her going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep her going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we got there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like a bus or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow that's a big pump truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I'm gonna go knock on the window.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring those guys over here for a quick
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're gonna go into the
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right the characters are in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: There they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up dogs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me light you up a little flammer to
go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bam-bammer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: How was the trip?
[SPEAKER_06]: The trip was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice weather coming down today.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well dude we're about to have nice food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah I've been eating here for about 20
something years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just before Monica's born existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me neither man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's impressive restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what they've been
consistently fucking killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah three chefs in the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Monica's 21 now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'd probably be 22-23 years that I've
been coming here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh it's always nice dabbing with some
friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabbing with some friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been dabbing in here in the truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a gold apex.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the one I got given to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very proud of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh there's yours.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you wanted me to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a pipe with hash on it right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more dab for Darren.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh this Astro Boy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah we have Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me have Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give him a dab of Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's some pretty stanky smelling stuff
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's got a really nice smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey we're hot boxing my truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot boxing on the Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right you got the Astro Boy on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one he requested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh you want the Astro Boy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine's at my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B has his here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this big ridiculous thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes I wanted to look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren we are here bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's spelled with an I by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Motherfucker calling me out on fucking my
own YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: With them crazy eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see the guy take a grind into this to
get it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to get it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't bother me either.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get one of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: 90 is the fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it's in the red.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take the fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have to ask him which one he
wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just offered him the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh do you want to heat him up the nail?
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do the dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh maybe less angled downwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're making me nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: First time I ever watched John use a
torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: He set.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well at first we thought it was his wallet
on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was actually money inside of his
wallet.
[SPEAKER_03]: His wallet was like way over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of a sudden it's like dude your
wallet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just money to burn that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you got money to burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Money to burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny B's got money to burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: I absolutely know I'm going to bench it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I had a lot of money I wouldn't burn
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd give it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would make excesses amount lots of hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would then proceed to give that hash
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be a part of that giveaway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like 12 grams of super silver
haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 grams of mullin bimby madness 90
micron.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what we're doing right now is

[SPEAKER_06]: We got chili prawns.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the panseed scallops.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be beautiful.

of the restaurant here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the canoe up top here which is
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really see it with the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh there it's just turned up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful art.

[SPEAKER_03]: We are back after a spectacular meal at
the salmon house on the hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just good all the way around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We picked out harsh.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not buy any desserts because
apparently you guys have brought desserts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this what I'm to understand?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we open these should we do a
quick round of like wicked 90 micron fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: frozen astro boy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love dessert.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dessert hush for dessert before dessert.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have the rag sir.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did it go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did I put that rag?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over by the camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone else is getting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm easy out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well you're the easy out guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm easy out and easy back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got our little dab rag.
[SPEAKER_03]: The funny thing is we had a whole
conversation about this rag.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know and then I just looked up being
present.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to have a present.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to have a clean dabber when
you're digging in with some fine full milk
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to my little guy there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear him?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's crying upstairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my new son.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just wants to be on Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like I need to feed my
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a real quick nice beautiful
banger of some just melty, melty,
[SPEAKER_03]: melty, melty.
Beautifulness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Attempted to go and get the carb cap over
there that I see sitting behind the sink.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll leave it on here just in case there's
the tiniest little bit of residual of the
[SPEAKER_03]: alcohol on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that sitting on the carb cap for a
few seconds is definitely going to
[SPEAKER_03]: evaporate it out pretty hardcore
considering it evaporates at room
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I think I see better with these things
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try and hide.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't hide behind the glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't below that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, after we do some little dabs
here, I've got to make sure that I can
[SPEAKER_04]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sure do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, is this my stand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you love this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you too, so make sure you get a
nice reasonable hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we're just basically going to
have a dessert rip here real quick and
[SPEAKER_03]: then it's going to be into these desserts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll show you what we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick wolf session.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe time for a funny story or
two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny story or two?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's so many good funny stories
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just... Are they going to be about
hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they sure could be about hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there are some funny stories
out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some great stories about hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some great stories about hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a story about hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want a baby one out of the thing,
like a little real small one?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, I want the watermelon one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is it right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever piece you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same one you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a ship?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is another thing we talked
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: John and I talked about the etiquette of
smoking out of expensive bongs and
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially breaking a bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a new type of etiquette.
[SPEAKER_03]: The etiquette of turning people onto dabs
without destroying them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to turn someone on in a way
that's, you know, that's reasonable and
[SPEAKER_03]: within their range of being able to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to fuck the guy up so that
he has nothing but a bad time for a good
[SPEAKER_06]: six, eight hours because he can't handle
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it ruins people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how's that watermelon drinking over
there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hit it the second time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did he ever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he ever?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not much left.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just can't believe the flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that's that's killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I need that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a ripper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's nailing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my lungs just looking at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that's my.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like an eye closer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like full on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to break sweat?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to sweat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, when you break sweat, forget about
things about breaking a sweat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that you've made your full-line
cannabinoid system very habitable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to do that with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just watch you.
[SPEAKER_03]: One for our chef.
[SPEAKER_03]: For who?
[SPEAKER_03]: For passing some of these plates out.
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you put down there, John?
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: A kush for like three months, so it's
going to be number four.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a kush and I dipped it in the Astro
Boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Double dipper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Astro Boy combo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Double dipper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clear domes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clear domes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get this man a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're staring at all that stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like looking at treats.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here are some of the delicious treats
that these guys brought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's like a lemon thing and a
pumpkin thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more beautiful things over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what these pink things are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chocolatey caramel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the cat, cat, cat.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they called?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the ones that fill full of puff
and cream.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm going to try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good reps?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean, no?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have one of these things for
you and your fam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to do all this stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have one of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe I'll have a cannoli later with
my family, and I'll have one of these now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even sure what it is, but it looks
delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like D420 got the good one,
the one he's been waiting for.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the sweat across the forehead,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you guys all for tuning in
and watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see infamiliars like Jake and Darren
showing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B., of course, Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you guys puffed a lot of bowls and
enjoyed the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: We almost forgot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the end of the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll probably take a few more dabs just
because I really want to as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before I forget, and Darren was kind
enough to remind me, the kind folks at
[SPEAKER_03]: Method 7 wanted me to pass on a pair of
their Sun Resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that, D420K.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Method 7 glasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Method 7.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know you will enjoy those on the
Harley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are a Sun version.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not really a light version for HPS
or LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have specific lenses for everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that bearded dragon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you can see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bearded dragon.
[SPEAKER_06]: They fit nice too.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're nice shades.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, again.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Method 7, Sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll enjoy these, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time for a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check them out on the way home to go on
the drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so a little RIPA for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Change the pipe picture a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's some really nice designs on
some of those pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, they're incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I zooming in on the screen or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_03]: See the Phoenix in the body?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the Phoenix is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Phoenix is the bird.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how the top of it is like a bird with
its wings up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't really see it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there it is, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew the head was a bird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was the most awesome Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, epic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good food, good bros, good smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking good time, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to finish it off with a Swiss
Perk RIP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to hit what you got packed
on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it looks so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so compressed, that's going to be a
big dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just greases right up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: For any of you Apex owners, I'm sure you
know this anyways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stick it on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stick it on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see my Apex bong that goes on the
battery?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Apex bong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll have to show it to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a good evening, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a good rip off of that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoyable buzz, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a fucking painful, holy fuck,
this is too fucking much, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still ripping.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, you'll be ripping till tomorrow
morning, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be ripping in your dreams tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got some good dreams,
who knows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why wouldn't they send you something?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the little bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of water coming up that piece
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you've got to be careful not to
get the I'm not going to be using that
[SPEAKER_02]: component anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use the one like right on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you just basically take your
globe off and go right in like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got yourself a little... Do
it, it's freshly packed, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Freshly packed, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go, laddie.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do I get that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they'll be available sooner than
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure where John got it from.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a glassblower in
Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool little unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is fucking awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a go there, Darren.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just white, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to show you a brand new little
addition to the Apex Pen, courtesy of
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: from the Prairie Cup in Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_03]: D420K's in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Jake's in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are packing the OG KUSH full-mount
dry sift into the Apex Pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are going to use this little guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this little guy out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful little piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little bubbler.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically... Take it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, pull the dome off, yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what's that you got stuck on your...
That's a nug.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a nug of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, a nug of hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just got to grab a nug of hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for a quick reload, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick reload.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you warm it up, it softens up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can basically just put it right on
and go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to do the honors?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love for you to do the honors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get the nice... Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a real little ripper, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, what a ripper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm ready to join this party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, it's real like comfortable and
portable in the hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really just fits well with the Apex
pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we
[SPEAKER_06]: go.
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing is so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Apex, too, is something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it's giving some rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give off the big rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greasing right up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, Apex with the little mini bong
attachment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's giving it a two thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Johnny B, for a great gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, D420K, for helping me test it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace, buddy.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to do my own video on
this specific little guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check for it on YouTube, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks for watching Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next time.
