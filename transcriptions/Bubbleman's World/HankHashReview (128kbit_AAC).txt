imagine that I'm a little bit nervous to
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure that it's all good and tasty and
wonderful Not sure what kind of star
[SPEAKER_03]: rating we're gonna see from this I'm
hoping for a 5 but it could come in at a 4
[SPEAKER_03]: you never know lower terpenes than I would
have liked in this particular hash but
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: The terpenes are still you know,
there's still about a 4% terpene range I
[SPEAKER_03]: would have loved to have seen it double
that In and around the 8 range,

doing the best job that we can and I'm

right out the fridge, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what best part about it was it arrived and
the jars were still cold to Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I think that was the only
process only point of the process that
[SPEAKER_00]: those weren't refrigerators when they were
in the truck and they got here quick
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that Beautiful man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm gonna say adios.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my product We'll go out of here and
we'll open it up and we'll check it out
[SPEAKER_03]: and hopefully we'll be dabbing this Within
the hour at home See you guys later Oh my
[SPEAKER_01]: god with my hat All
[SPEAKER_03]: right, hey guys welcome back I have Driven
home from up in smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a very quick and short trip with
Dom or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is One gram of Hank bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your tax stamp right there BC tax
stamp and then this is a child Label so we
[SPEAKER_03]: got to figure out a I guess pinch here
Yeah, there we go So you can see it opened
[SPEAKER_03]: on the front.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a child safety thing where you
got to grab these two things and pull them
[SPEAKER_03]: off So it opens so it opens not on the
top, but it opens right across the middle
[SPEAKER_03]: The jar is nice and cold still there's our
big crazy label that we had to put on Hank
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this is basically the government,
you know making sure that you have your
[SPEAKER_03]: THC warning You can have your your logo
right there, which you can see the Hank
[SPEAKER_03]: logo right there And then it's gonna tell
you, you know your total THC total CBD and
[SPEAKER_03]: then Some funny warnings about toxic and
carcinogenic chemicals found in tobacco
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, okay Well, this isn't actually
tobacco smoke, but we put it on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, there's the barcodes on the back
that they need and then of course it's
[SPEAKER_03]: talks about The lot number that came from
the date that it was packaged on this was
[SPEAKER_03]: packaged on At the end of 2020 so not too
long ago Gonna crack the jar open a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit here kind of exciting I'm excited for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna lie 30 years in the making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh And there we go a little bit of hashish
So there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a decent nose on it for being
cold Generally resin will get a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: See if I can kind of move this around a
bit Oh, it's definitely wanting to have
[SPEAKER_03]: self-pressed a little bit in the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Yeah, that's good sign right there I
like that So you can kind of see this nice
[SPEAKER_03]: scooper that I got from D nail Nice little
scooper what I wanted to do with you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: was I wanted to put a little bit inside
parchment Hit it with the hair
[SPEAKER_03]: straightener to see if we can't make some
dabs out of it So I think we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_03]: that right off the bat I'll just put a
little bit of the gram in here not the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole thing you can see that I had to
scrape it off to get down and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: self pressing itself, so let's Check this
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll turn the old hair straightener on
Incredible to be a part of a system like
[SPEAKER_03]: this that does not allow me to test or do
any of these things from a smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, but that's why I'm here with
you guys today and kind of happy to To do
[SPEAKER_03]: this with everyone to show everyone what's
going on You know show everyone the
[SPEAKER_03]: quality of what we produced here.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if we can't get a nice little Okay
Turn that off does that cut for those of
[SPEAKER_03]: you that don't know this hair straightener
hasn't been used since 2014 or 2015 Sorry
[SPEAKER_03]: when I did my rosin video with the dry
sift so that is the last time that I did
[SPEAKER_03]: that All right, so that's what we got I
Did hit it a couple of times just to make
[SPEAKER_03]: it a sort of dabble product.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what we can do here Okay This
will probably heat this up a tiny bit Just
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit In order to pick this dab up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's my first dab that I'm gonna try
of the Hank That's what the Hank looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like after you hit it with a little bit of
heat and pressure so it looks like The
[SPEAKER_03]: quality is there I'm just hoping
personally for a five-star.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this isn't six-star, but I want to
get up to that five-star I wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_03]: completely disappointed if it turned out
to a four-star and for those of you that
[SPEAKER_03]: are wondering this is really in relation
to the Melt factor, I'm sure we're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: see some chas left over on this which
means it's not gonna be a six But let's
[SPEAKER_03]: hope we can fit it into that five and if
it is into a four I'm gonna be honest
[SPEAKER_03]: about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first hash that we've
produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very proud of the entire Team.
[SPEAKER_03]: We worked our butts off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was incredible hoops to jump through
Just finding cannabis that was grown in
[SPEAKER_03]: enough weight and numbers that we could
Produce enough so that provinces if they
[SPEAKER_03]: sold it and sold out of it We could re up
them because there's a penalty if you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't so many different hoops to jump
through not just for us But the people who
[SPEAKER_03]: are selling it as well that it's kind of a
miracle that I'm here now able to finally
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke the Hank hash and Let's light up
that bank
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, what I just noticed was I don't
have water in my bubbler So we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: do a quick little fill up on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take this out Because we haven't
filled it gotten it too hot yet Tap Give
[SPEAKER_03]: this some water out of my new memo bottle
for those of you that are wondering why I
[SPEAKER_03]: have this square bottle The company is
called memo bottle Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in Australia to make these really
cool Square water bottles that fit in bags
[SPEAKER_03]: go in your laptop bag lay on tables really
nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty awesome They're big
supporters of water org, which is also a
[SPEAKER_03]: great organization that helps get clean
water to people that need it And so every
[SPEAKER_03]: time you buy a bottle you support that
Love to see Hank and embark find similar
[SPEAKER_03]: things to do in the future when we can get
To a positive and be producing and making
[SPEAKER_03]: sales You know for more than just a couple
of weeks because this is literally our
[SPEAKER_03]: first product that we brought to market
All right So we got the temp tech here,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're gonna have a little dab little dab
of the Of the Hank product We'll check it
[SPEAKER_03]: out All right, I'm pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been waiting For 30 years to be able
to make hash sell it in the store and then
[SPEAKER_03]: go and buy it So I'm excited to try the
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect you guys will be excited as well
I'm looking forward to hearing what
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone's thoughts are you can get Hank
on the BC cannabis stores calm But more
[SPEAKER_03]: importantly you can get Hank at some of
the legacy stores here in British Columbia
[SPEAKER_03]: like THC like up and smoke shops that
transferred over to the legacy market
[SPEAKER_03]: brought all that great knowledge and are
now In the legal market and I felt
[SPEAKER_03]: compelled to sort of help those those guys
out because they've been doing it for for
[SPEAKER_03]: so long So here we go Time for a little
bubbly boobily
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that definitely melted and bubbled
But I don't know if it's gonna make a
[SPEAKER_03]: five-star.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to see I'm gonna heat it up a
little bit more on the side here Looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like it could be more like a four See what
happens
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got that deep Afghan flavor for sure
There it is
[SPEAKER_03]: I Put just the tiniest bit too much water
in so what I want to do is Pour a little
[SPEAKER_03]: of that out And go for another little rip
so we're gonna clean this out definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: have a little bit of chas here There's no
doubt about it
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too too bad on the q-tip there,
but definitely some chas I'm gonna hit
[SPEAKER_03]: another bowl and Really kind of give that
full I definitely felt it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a strong head space to it You can
feel immediately after the first rip that
[SPEAKER_03]: you are indeed getting high Second one
took me right to where I usually like to
[SPEAKER_03]: be I normally wouldn't probably take
another One right after the first one like
[SPEAKER_03]: this, but because we're doing a review I
think it's probably pretty important that
[SPEAKER_03]: we do it so I'll break a tiny other piece
off right there of some of the hank so you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it was a real joy to run this
material and Just know everything from
[SPEAKER_03]: start to finish and now to be here kind of
as you know my own bubble man guy now
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing a review on product that a company
has produced so I was Close to buying some
[SPEAKER_03]: hash in the legal market over the course
of the last couple of months of course
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B And I went and got the gram of
Whistler Medical's hash rosin for $150 a
[SPEAKER_03]: gram this is less than half the cost of
that this is $70 a gram with tax and so
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice that we could be coming in at a good
price.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see it even get to a better
price But with the amount that the
[SPEAKER_03]: province puts on it and The amount that
they force us into packaging and
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations and all the framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just been a really sort of cool thing
to be a part of and I just can't tell you
[SPEAKER_03]: how Absolutely excited I am to be sitting
here now with the high Coming on very
[SPEAKER_03]: nicely now and just realizing that you
know my team They made this happen like we
[SPEAKER_03]: did this it took years of our hard work,
and I just really want to shout out
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone On that team because you know
this did not come easy and shout out to
[SPEAKER_03]: you know to the growers of course as well
We couldn't do it without them oh This one
[SPEAKER_03]: bubbling melted nicely you can see that in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bubbling up good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that dab was nice Not gonna lie that
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoyed I Think I let the banger
cool down a little bit too much for the
[SPEAKER_03]: last one so I got a really Nice low temp
hit I heated it up a little more and I
[SPEAKER_03]: just didn't get the bubbling effect like I
did off of this one This is definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: between a 4 and a 5 star I want to give it
a 4.5 Because I don't want to you know be
[SPEAKER_03]: biased, but the way that was bubbling and
melting I'd say that's probably between a
[SPEAKER_03]: 4 and a 4.5 I will try to do a macro video
so you guys can see it close up bubbling
[SPEAKER_03]: and melting It's definitely leaving some
material behind and this is 120 micron 90
[SPEAKER_03]: micron 73 micron and 45 micron All mixed
and homogenized nicely together,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it'll be nice to see how long a gram
lasts me I don't generally buy hash by the
[SPEAKER_03]: gram so this is kind of new to me as well
This is my first experience with
[SPEAKER_03]: purchasing for in the legal Regulated
framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a license and been able to grow
my own and produce my own for quite some
[SPEAKER_03]: time Gonna give this another little hit
[SPEAKER_03]: All right Beautiful Beautiful,
so we'll clean that up Yeah, you can see
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you guys some more of the chas
here So a little more of the chas on that
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of see chunks of leftover
material Certainly not the six that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: always looking for but the fact that we
got a melty dabble bubble To market during
[SPEAKER_03]: a global pandemic Shout out to the team
that embark Shout out to Hank whoever you
[SPEAKER_03]: are wherever you are Thanks for the good
times, buddy You can pick that up in any
[SPEAKER_03]: of the BC stores But I would urge you if
you can and you're local go support the
[SPEAKER_03]: guys that have been legacy You know,
there's some beautiful stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really did enjoy a lot of the Vancouver
shops that I went and visited to but I am
[SPEAKER_03]: a little biased to want to help out the
the legacy people that were doing it and
[SPEAKER_03]: pushing the envelope and Practicing the
civil disobedience that really allowed us
[SPEAKER_03]: to get to where we are today with
regulations So thank you to those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the guys at THC I'll be
buying a gram from you and shout out to
[SPEAKER_03]: Dom and Max over at up and smoke on West
Broadway, I believe great guys great shop
[SPEAKER_03]: and really was it felt great to be
supporting them and simultaneously
[SPEAKER_03]: supporting my own self in the sense of my
my journey and How long it's taken to get
[SPEAKER_03]: to a point where you know where I can go
buy hash that I was a part of making so
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to hear what you guys all
think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love to hear your opinions If you think
the star rating is lower, let me know if
[SPEAKER_03]: you think the star rating is higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know I definitely want to hear your
guys's opinions and we're willing to take
[SPEAKER_03]: constructive criticism we're gonna be
working very hard to constantly uplift
[SPEAKER_03]: quality and get things better,
but This is cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, may the full melt bless your bowl
Sooner than later Peace out everybody You
You You You You You
