[SPEAKER_04]: We're about to hit the moonshine haze

[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take it from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't suck up the beeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're blowing the hits out the window
because it's three in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really feel like dealing with
security, but we'll have more from the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis cup later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
