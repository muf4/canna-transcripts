[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, welcome to Embark Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't really brought you guys in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just one room that we're going to
be going into today, room 108.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our water extraction room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of chaos in there right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just preparing for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the machines getting all set up
to the pumps and to the hoses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's been cleaned perfectly
yesterday, so it's all just sitting there
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have hash that's being prepared and
dried in the freeze dryers that we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: sieving later today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go get 6,000 grams of
dried, cured black cherry punch flour and
[SPEAKER_01]: throw it into the reactor with a bunch of
ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take you guys in here real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little tag there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's our Whistler equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the SPX pumps all need to
be hooked up and dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our Whistler Technologies unit
that we'll be filling up today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our bubble bag lights in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our two 32 gallon tanks here that
we'll be putting our bags into.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our cleaning tub here and then
we've got a recirc tub back here,
[SPEAKER_01]: 65 gallons that Craig's setting up right
now to another pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: That allows us to remove the water from
the 300 gallon tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it into here and then pump it through
and create a closed loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The freeze dryers are of course right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working with yesterday's material
and we'll go through those and do a final
[SPEAKER_01]: dry in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then of course the cold draft ice machine,
which is making our beautiful ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see this ice is absolutely
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect, perfect ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: This process is basically calibrating the
scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to calibrate the scales with
our weights that are right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This lets us just know that the scales are
working properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they're calibrated, they won't be
moved for the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Uli's doing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to head over to the vault and
grab the flower that we're going to run
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vault's just over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another room.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we used to run water
extraction right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BFDs are still on the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we used to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are in one of our vaults.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a nice big deep freezer right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That deep freezer has 6,000 grams of black
cherry punch right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is generally paperwork that you're
going to be wanting to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry guys, I'm zooming in a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is paperwork that you're going to
want to do with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the paperwork over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craig will come in and do that after me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just grabbing the flower for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that say, hey,
that's not how you're supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are still doing our paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very, very compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get this 6,000 grams back to our room that
we're going to be running the hash in
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit difficult holding the
bag and the camera, but we made it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 6 kilos of black cherry punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to open these bags and get
them into the reactor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see the quality of what we're
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice frosty, crystal-y nuggets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very consistent in every bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice bouquet on this flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to dump it into the reactor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six bags of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually give them a little rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of trichomes stuck in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I think I turned the water off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go back to that once we look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it even.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the weed is dry especially,
it's good to get the ice on top and
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing it down to soak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting up high, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad I shut that water off.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is good ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ice and the material has soaked
because it's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We let it soak for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also start the impeller mixing at a
lower rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a little re-circ here with Uli
and Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filtering through the 2190s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the agitator going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pump number two is pumping everything out
of these containers back into the reactor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reactor has pump number one,
which is Uli's pump right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's filling up the bags with hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash will be filtered through the
screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the water will come out from the
bottom and go back into the reactor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called a re-circ.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do this for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll do our pull really soon here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just pulling the 190.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little catch bag for catching the
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: See that, Uli?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get too close to the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the 190, so that's the lowest
grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really just used to catch
everything you don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will still probably be around 50% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could still be used for plant fat
extractions or any type of solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction if you so choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to rinse and clean out the hash
still too though, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a job we're doing for a company
that wants just the 45 through 160.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want the 190 or anything above
160 and anything below 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why you're seeing only two bags
get pulled here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see a nice big pile of 45 here for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll lift it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice big log in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I
[SPEAKER_02]: got this side up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably good for the pre-wash
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep as much as we can in this
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're lifting it, you just want
to... What I would suggest is if Uli pulls
[SPEAKER_01]: it a little higher for you, pull it on all
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like that, but like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting it pulled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you want to use this and just move
the hash around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of hash in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll clean this last little bit up after
because if you keep putting water in,
[SPEAKER_01]: see how the... There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see the... Sanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns into sand, muck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's big chunks of hash in here,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I get it, you see how it's slowly but
surely turning into hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Turning into an oatmeal?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the water, yeah, thick oatmeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can do your squeeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to keep it up though so that I
don't get more water from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't flip it all the way over this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a huge, huge ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just squeeze the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get the water out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more water we get out, the faster our
freeze-dry time is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just squeeze that ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that excess water out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people call this bruising the
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not so.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stronger than you might think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can dump this water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go get your tray?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put that back in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then lift it out and you can scoop the
hash onto the tray form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can just pick it up with your
hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you need to split that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to split it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut it in half with the spoon while we're
holding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just put it boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even for one tray, are you sure it's not
a... Well, we can bring it over and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can put half of it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get another tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can use the hose again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get ourselves nice and adjusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this, Craig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we pulled a bowl that big ever?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a big bowl, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have got a picture, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this part, you can pull it out a
little wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just agitate it with your spoon
and then scoop it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, some of it gets in here and also
washed into the next bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to clean it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll rinse this bag inside the next 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is only one 45 we pulled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opening up the valve on the freeze dryer
to release the pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see right here, the pressure
around the gasket is very tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will get thinner and thinner and
thinner until it disappears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll pull out the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scroll pumps for the win.
[SPEAKER_01]: No oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scroll pumps for the win.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, pull it right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice big, fat tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dry one.
Check, check, check.
Check, check, check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check, check, check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check, check, check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check, check, check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check, check, check.
