[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting here with John B.
[SPEAKER_02]: and we are at the Vapor Lounge on the top
floor, right above the CCHQ, kind of next
[SPEAKER_02]: door and above.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the Mini Queen, Joe Peter's
Banjo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely impeccable piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was puffing it recently, as you saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took some photos of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: John has hit the larger piece before,
but today we're going to hit the Mini.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I'll hold that up so they can see
you torching that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the dome right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's upside down in my hand, but it will
be right side up when I put it on,
[SPEAKER_02]: I assure you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a pleasure to hit such a beautiful
piece of art.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we're hitting the beautiful
MK Ultra dry sift that I cleaned out the
[SPEAKER_02]: other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool, I can watch how it's
coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, wow, it's an amazing hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait on next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tiniest, tiniest, tiniest little
amount of water in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's see if you have time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely that MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally get to pump all this juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bowl is quite deep, the dome,
so you really want to... See, John,
[SPEAKER_02]: see where it'll fit?
[SPEAKER_02]: The top of it will be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The spark's going to put the dome on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I'll do the whole thing for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just basically take the rim.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the flame turned down nice and
low so we don't really want to create too
[SPEAKER_01]: much heat around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, and then we'll get into
position.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice little piece that just hits so
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again, lab421, for letting us hit
such a beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here with John B.
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Vapor Lounge upstairs, and about to
hit the Vela G, one of the pioneers,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the pioneer, I'm told,
by spliff underscore dafts on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is his piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a collector on this particular floor
of the lip raps.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, it looks very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to show you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the quality of that little piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really a small amount of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes with a really nice dome,
but I'm old and can't really see good in
[SPEAKER_02]: it, so he put the domeless on for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to hit a little sweet scum
from the House of the Great Garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's trying to remember all these things
to shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: While simultaneously doing a little
torching, something you don't see me do
[SPEAKER_02]: very often,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, if you can see that,
it bubbles like you know so much,
[SPEAKER_00]: like everything goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the perk on this one in particular,
it's just so, he'll tell you, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: admittedly amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There really is something to be said for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the smallest amount of water,
almost like nothing is there at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think definitely one of the things
he's got going on for him is that he
[SPEAKER_02]: pushes up the bottom a slight bit to
definitely give more access to the perk
[SPEAKER_02]: for the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful little piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check him out at spliff underscore dafts
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks for watching.
