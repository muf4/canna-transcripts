[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Buggleman's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just actually going to clean up a
little sift that John B brought by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a low quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what it is, but it had all
this hair in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I got it onto my screens,
I figured I was just going to do a real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick cleaning out of the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought you guys might be interested
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to set the camera up so you
can see a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to see my ugly mug,
but you're going to see what my hands are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and how we're working the sift
through the screen to fall down on the
[SPEAKER_00]: catch and then hopefully be left with the
hairs on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so generally what I would do in this
situation is I would kind of gently let it
[SPEAKER_00]: rain down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it already leaving quite a bit
of dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very large screen, so it's not a
small screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use the brush a little bit to
kind of brush it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to contaminate the brush quite
a bit, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am using in a really large amount of
sift here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't normally do this, but I thought
it would kind of make a neat little video
[SPEAKER_00]: where we just watch all of this sift get
worked through the screen and eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: be left with just the hairs, which is what
should be happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I've gone and I could have
showed this same trick with a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, but that's not how Bubble Man
rolls, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice pile falling through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low quality though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop a little bit there on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not overly worried about the quality
because it's very dirty, needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some dark sift
[SPEAKER_00]: falling out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeez, get all this other good sift out of
the way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want that sort of contamination
now, do we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful while sifting low quality sift
around your high quality sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be brutal?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to take a nice rip of your 99% barb
dry sift and you've got this absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: shwaggles that's contaminated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To think that someone considers this a
final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is almost not worth being a first
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a starting product, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost not worth the starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just salt and pepper shaking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start seeing the little pieces,
the little balls here in the bottom that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not quite breaking up, but have
pressed themselves mildly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be left with a lot of
those in the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, we're getting down to the
nitty-nob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get down lower, the brush will even
push it through faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's a big screen like this,
you can use the brush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to try to use the brush on
the smaller screen, you're going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the rigidness of the card and
the flatness comes in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine when they're making the Moroccan
hash, how much of this resin and small
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate is flying around in the rooms
that they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nose is so itchy right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because people often ask me if
it gets itchy, and usually it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's high quality, it doesn't at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more likely when everything's broken
down to these small or low quality bits of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant matter that you feel that little bit
of itch in the nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so we've run a good solid 200
grams through this little colander.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get down lower, it'll make it even
more difficult, and you'll start seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants that would otherwise be in
the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I'd call this hash just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's call this a mild cleaning,
a de-haring of the farmer's grade sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmer's grade, farmer's grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with farmer's grade,
that's what you start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's something wrong if you're
putting it in your pile as your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but if you're starting with
farmer's grade, that's nothing wrong with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so this is starting to,
you can't really see, but it's feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: different under the brush now,
and it might look different on the camera
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've got now is we've got a
collection of capitate stalks and systolic
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think I'd be left with this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be more like a small
pile, but it does feel like the majority
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we have here on top is a
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the heavier heads will have fallen
down by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to say, you know, because it's a
big screen, I could still get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: this to fall through, but it's not
necessarily something we want to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'll take it down a little bit more,
see if I can clean it up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more, and then yeah, it's pretty wild how
the consistency has changed completely,
[SPEAKER_00]: and left me with this just weird
paper-like material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely different from the rest of the
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, we've just got a real
terrible quality of shit that we just took
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that hash, and look how much we
took out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fair bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well now that everything in my
office is covered in resin, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was what I worked through the screen,
and it's still, you know, a terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: quality by most people's standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: but much cleaner than it was before we
started the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a bad sign that some of the resin is
sticking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so we'll probably get to
screening this over the next little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for now, that was just a little tip on
how you can remove this unwanted stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: from your hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope you guys can see the quality
of that and how it's not even hash at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weird-like substance that is not
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thanks for watching Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
you
