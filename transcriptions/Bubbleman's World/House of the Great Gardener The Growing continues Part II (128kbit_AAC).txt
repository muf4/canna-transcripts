[SPEAKER_00]: We will see you guys in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so we got a nice little pile of
sift sitting on our top screen here,
[SPEAKER_11]: screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the 250, the 60 LPI.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the resin will be mildly contaminated.
[SPEAKER_11]: We could give it another flick and collect
resin underneath.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one way of producing a nice variety
of head.
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course we already have collected
over on this and the extremely nice gentle
[SPEAKER_11]: light sift of pure heads.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got some nice photos on the macro
lens.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to show you those.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well unless you want to flick it a couple
more times, it's totally up to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have so much, I would just card it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a killer grade and if not it can be
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's like literally one or two
stigma hairs in there and that's it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice to see the purity as always.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man, look at it on the card.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's coming up.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to be careful, you'd almost need
a brush for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I would have kept that separate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, keep that separate.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because it'll always cause problems
for cleaning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Still perfect for puffing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just cause more problems for cleaning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see if I got a card.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the high grade siftmon.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a little brush obviously if you had
one.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could clean this all up much nicer.
[SPEAKER_11]: You definitely don't want to let it well
plug your screen eventually.
[SPEAKER_11]: It can sit as long as you just get a card
and clean that because you can see how
[SPEAKER_11]: that resin is already creating a bit of a
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we call quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another day at the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: Another day at the office with the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: He has some pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm going to bring it down and take
a few.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or I can take it right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's my camera.
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, Matt has a ridiculous amount of
bud all binned up and he's going to be
[SPEAKER_11]: playing with these screens for a while and
you guys can check him out on his Facebook
[SPEAKER_11]: account.
[SPEAKER_11]: The House of the Great Gardener and his
Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to be posting the photos
that we end up taking but there's tons
[SPEAKER_11]: more sifting to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we will show you that we're going
to take that herb down and put it in his
[SPEAKER_11]: large tumbler for the 10 minute run.
[SPEAKER_11]: The 1 hour run and then finally the 24
hour run.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, I think that's about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll show you a few more things here and
we'll be done with our visit to the great
[SPEAKER_11]: gardeners.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bud is furry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Furry nugget.
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so we just lifted that screen
that we just sifted over and basically
[SPEAKER_11]: have another level of sift.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this came through the 180.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've got our 250 micron and our 180.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one came through.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll card it up gently.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's ridges.
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you call this one?
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess this would be the second flick.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was we carded up the resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think it would be more
contaminated than that other second
[SPEAKER_11]: version.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I were a betting man.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it does look pretty damn good color
wise.
[SPEAKER_10]: A little pile of the barb.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guaranteed it will melt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, lighter than the stuff that's on top.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that sparkly effect, eh?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it sure does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lost in the cosmos.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you know about dirty scissors?
[SPEAKER_11]: How's the great gardener nose?
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, great gardener.
[SPEAKER_11]: And bubble man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why didn't it work?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just carding up the resin that
didn't go through the 90 lpi 180 micron
[SPEAKER_07]: screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little pile of hash nuggets.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hash nuggets.
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I would definitely suggest you
getting in the future is a nice big brush.
[SPEAKER_11]: It will blow the card idea away.
[SPEAKER_11]: With these ridges and stuff, it won't be
an issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll be able to brush all the resin up
so much faster with the carding.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'll also be able to clean this
screen with a nice big brush.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, a big static free brush.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time you're using these screens,
you're basically making hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, whether you're using the 250 micron,
the 180 micron, or my regular size
[SPEAKER_11]: screens, which is the 150 and the 70,
which always come in handy when you want
[SPEAKER_11]: to clean the resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is more of a, if you're going to do
an initial screening, use a few nice
[SPEAKER_11]: screens and do it right.
[SPEAKER_07]: My card gets smaller and smaller.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those screens get bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's it, eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: See you with a big, huge scooper soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: A giant 8.5 by 12 card.
[SPEAKER_11]: Special business cards that are for
commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_11]: The size of an album.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, nice album cover.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably like a painter's palette more.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, I like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're thinking the drywall thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I pictured.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know those drywall finisher guys?
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, you need me over there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_11]: Another pile of resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: It feels like a big heart.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can also see it falling like rain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like being in a pollen room.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a certain person that wouldn't like
this.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I guess we're going to go on top
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: What we want to do here now is be
extremely gentle.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't touch the screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't rub this stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can touch the frame, no problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: But don't rub the bud on the screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: All we're going to do is a bounce.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once again, the quality of this herb is
definitely on par.
[SPEAKER_11]: On par.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they don't fuck around at the
house of the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dab-a-doo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dab-a-doo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dab-a-doo.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a fun event, eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: We want the Dab-a-doo to come to Toronto.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just keep the stalks in the pile.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big nuggets flying here at the house of
the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is definitely Afghani dominant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at that thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this has been a strain you've had for
quite a while?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we had the shish-ke-berry for,
oh man, since the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my favorite smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a heavy smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a social.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you smoke it with your friends
when you're having good times.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a great social weed,
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I came across the Afghani strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Afghani strain was by far the best
painkiller that we had come across for a
[SPEAKER_07]: long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm breaking the rule here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the cushions and stuff now that
are better, but that Afghani is the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big fat nugget.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we crossed that really good Afghani
male.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for structure purposes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we used it in the basis of crossing a
bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the shish-ke-berry was on that list.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the 2004 raid of the RCMP on
the Vickrey facility that we built,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was lost.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of the strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the other strains was the Princess.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Princess was the number one
strain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that a C99?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the Princess was...
[SPEAKER_07]: Bubblegum Romulan?
[SPEAKER_07]: What else was in it?
[SPEAKER_07]: There was something else in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was three genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The seeds were given to us by one of the
old shop owners.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Bubblegum?
[SPEAKER_07]: Romulan?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't think of the third one right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was the other one lost.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always hate this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my favorite shish-ke-berry.
[SPEAKER_07]: She lived on in the shish-ke-berry Afghani
cross.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we started those seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just looking, looking for the hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: It sure brought it back to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also know the shish-ke-berry from the
mid-90s.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hadn't seen it in so long.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then coming here and seeing the barb,
I was just like, there's shish-ke-berry in
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And not just like the smell or something,
but it's like the structure of the bud,
[SPEAKER_11]: the way the bud kind of looked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the growing of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing crazy about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no extremes on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody can grow it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like some of those buds out there
that... You gonna do the whole thing?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course we're gonna do the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We should almost shift this.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is fun work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smell is so good.
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't talked much about that,
have we?
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the last time we were here,
as many of the people watching right now
[SPEAKER_11]: will be thinking, yeah, weren't they
supposed to close down?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, obviously our injunction was
accepted and went through.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Crown was of course appealing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a grandfather.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Grandfathered in.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I was somewhat confused by it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was something between, as long as your
license went to at least March 21st,
[SPEAKER_07]: you were... Well, there's a whole bunch of
things that are wrong with the decision in
[SPEAKER_07]: itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that it limits people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think you had to have a production
license as of... Or a production license
[SPEAKER_07]: as of September.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it September 31st, 2013?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a personal license that was active...
March 21st or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a bunch of people that,
because their production license...
[SPEAKER_07]: I think more DG's that were affected by
that ruling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because what happened was there wasn't
enough time.
[SPEAKER_07]: They knew the program was ending and then
there wasn't enough time or they had
[SPEAKER_07]: trouble and didn't, you know, got delayed.
[SPEAKER_07]: That they said, ah, forget it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think the people didn't renew
their license.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they got stuck in that little void.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as long as you had a valid license as
of...
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's September 31st.
[SPEAKER_07]: I may be wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: 2013, you're grandfathered in until... As
long as you got it before then?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, as long as it was valid as of.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if your license expired on September
30th, it would extremely suck to be that
[SPEAKER_07]: person.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine just expired on March 31st.
[SPEAKER_07]: So mine's actually written to expire May
23rd or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I got it the week before Health
Canada sent out the news about the ending
[SPEAKER_07]: of the program.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not the letter that exposed us all
to the mail people.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a separate letter.
[SPEAKER_11]: They do all sorts of offensive letters
when they're dealing with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I'm not sure, I mean...
[SPEAKER_11]: We are really the easiest kind of people
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just let us do what we want to do and
we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not causing problems, we're not...
Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a strange situation.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm very glad to say that that
injunction is happening for now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The injunction is happening for now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The crappy part is that the government
came back and they're appealing the
[SPEAKER_07]: injunction.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everyone sort of sat back and they're
like, oh, awesome, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trials take forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine took six years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So injunctions are awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appeals, not so awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the government appealed it and they
could hear that case within a month,
[SPEAKER_07]: a couple weeks.
So here we go again.
The government's coming forward and
saying, oh, the judge went too far.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I sit back and I'm like, what are you
talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: The judge went too far.
[SPEAKER_07]: The judge didn't go far enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_07]: They put a 150 gram limit out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's individuals that have licenses
that are more than 150 grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what does that guy?
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy can't leave his house for the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, let's go skiing in Whistler for the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't because that guy would have to
carry more.
[SPEAKER_07]: He would have to carry, say two days.
[SPEAKER_07]: 300 grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: If he gets caught by the police,
he's a criminal.
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy would be arrested and charged
under the criminal code of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And our criminal code now is pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: For having two days supply of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are, I know, we've already got a
list of over 200 people that have moved
[SPEAKER_07]: because you can't move your license
anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your grandfather did, but your license
stays to whatever location it was attached
[SPEAKER_07]: to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did you move?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I guess go make a deal with the
people that moved into your house.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't move it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's gently lift this before we get too
violent.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Both of us, it's our nature to grab this
pot and move it around, which there's,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing saying that you can't do
it afterwards when it's been moved over
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess we'll put this over the pile in
the far end.
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_12]: These are good.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, once again, a good amount of
sift, way better distributed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you kind of see here where you see
these little black bits and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: How do they get caught on the screen?
[SPEAKER_11]: You just come down on a 45 and all of a
sudden you see them all.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all there, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more than you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you see them sticking straight up?
[SPEAKER_11]: Go right down to the right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that nuts?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the trick, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why now here's what we don't want
to bang this screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: This screen we want to lift very gently
and put over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we know what we have underneath
is going to be of the utmost quality.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the top of the screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if you guys can see if I get
down at the angle the way we were looking.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can kind of, let's see if we can
get some fancy camera work happening here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if we can,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're good to show you what's going on
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_11]: All those little bits and pieces,
all those little contaminants are lodged
[SPEAKER_11]: into the screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then underneath the big screen we've
got what I would say is going to be
[SPEAKER_11]: probably 99 plus percent heads.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it hurts me to card these up,
but next time I come you're going to have
[SPEAKER_11]: your brush and you're going to be all
about brushing.
[SPEAKER_11]: At least for this grade.
[SPEAKER_11]: Carding everything else is not a big
problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: My card is so gummed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, I have a clean one right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the right quality right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd say we're looking at about pure heads.
[SPEAKER_11]: And not just a hit of it either.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's the cool thing about
coming to the Great Gardener's place and
[SPEAKER_11]: sifting it up with Matt.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, his genetics just rain sift.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just produce resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Haoma, the Afghani, the JT,
or is it JT?
[SPEAKER_07]: JT15.
[SPEAKER_11]: JT15.
[SPEAKER_11]: And isn't there another one?
[SPEAKER_11]: Jean Guy or something?
[SPEAKER_07]: Jean Guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jean Guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet Skunk and René.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now all of his kind of tonic.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to say what I'm most excited about
is to come check out in the near future of
[SPEAKER_11]: hash making is to come check out the high
CBD hybrids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I hear a lot about CBD and high CBD
markers and how it's the best medicinal
[SPEAKER_11]: for a lot of different people.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I haven't really experienced it for
myself but I'd like to start experimenting
[SPEAKER_11]: and hitting the high CBD strains that
you've developed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we got CBD Haoma, CBD Afghani,
CBD Sweet Skunk, CBD Deepweed,
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD Warlock, CBD René.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll be hitting the clubs soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll be hitting, you know, we got
inquiries all the time for the high CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: The CBD seeds are going to be coming right
behind them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just in the final phenotype
selection.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be experimenting as we were
showing Bubble Man a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the one CBD René has flavour.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the whole project for us is about
getting flavourful CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially the Digweed and the René
are totally top notch in that category.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you guys produced CBD Barp?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I have it?
[SPEAKER_07]: We will.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be on the list to produce a CBD
Barp.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it wasn't in the room of the initial
cross at the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well that's... We'll get on that
though.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you might have just given me a
project from the breeding room that just
[SPEAKER_07]: became available.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm doing right now is I've femmed
the CBD Warlock and I'm crossing it in
[SPEAKER_07]: with the Jean Guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jean Guy is a huge heavy hitter.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's a potent strain, huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's literally one of those strains where
I personally do not smoke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wrecks my day.
[SPEAKER_07]: These can't get anything done.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, John Profella would probably love
that as a pain management... Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no doubt that it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: It works.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got it from the Montreal Club as their
number one painkiller.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we were switching... Well,
not switching, but sharing strains in
[SPEAKER_07]: amongst the clubs, that was the one
that... They sent us a whole bunch at the
[SPEAKER_07]: time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was the one when we put it to the
members here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know when people are coming back sort
of the same day saying, yes, I'll take
[SPEAKER_07]: some more of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on to something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we're going to lift up this sift.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is our first grade.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll probably give this a quick flick,
which will give us another second grade
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'll show you that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, we're going to keep working
here and get through these tubs,
[SPEAKER_11]: get this ready for the big machine.
[SPEAKER_11]: So see you guys back in a bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do your thing, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny to watch Matt do this because I
know in 20 years from now, he'll still be
[SPEAKER_11]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the day he learned it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Done.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really do see it.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's that B grade looking?
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty good for a B grade.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whispy it is, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you got to do it too fast and you
like almost create like a wave.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of the good way to do it too.
[SPEAKER_11]: You do it too slow and you melt the resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Put a brush.
[SPEAKER_11]: Future references.
[SPEAKER_11]: A brush.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I want to photograph this happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and she goes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's right on the top of the screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's still fairly contaminated,
but probably cleaner than 90% of most
[SPEAKER_11]: people's sift.
[SPEAKER_11]: Barb doing it right since, since when?
[SPEAKER_11]: Early 90s?
[SPEAKER_11]: Early 90s.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just checking out.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll leave that one on there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause now you got your two.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, terrible.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not terrible.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause once again, each time you've done it
today, it's been completely saved.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the other one though,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the other side.
[SPEAKER_11]: Push it over a bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it looking?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit higher and a little few,
a few more hairs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiny little bit more contaminant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gardening it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this was an empty room when I got here
today and the house has basically half
[SPEAKER_11]: filled it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The clones have a little bit of droop
right now, but they looked amazing when
[SPEAKER_11]: they first went in much like this guy
right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I have no doubt that these will
become beautiful, big ass plants in the
[SPEAKER_11]: near future.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: A little droopy though.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just mentioned that, but I mentioned how
good they looked when they first went in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at this one already.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of these are standing up now.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't get as much seed as we wanted
to, so we have to do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we just keep collecting our first and
second grades and then we end up being
[SPEAKER_11]: left with, I guess, a secondary secondary
grade, which is on top of the 250 screen
[SPEAKER_11]: here.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see the way we're carding right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing it purposely like this because
the resin moves nicer when you almost blow
[SPEAKER_11]: it across the screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: If we start carding like this,
you'll see instantly that it sticks to the
[SPEAKER_11]: screen and it becomes a little more
problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five thirds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is our thirds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Flicked it right on him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's good when you're doing this
process that you clean your screens each
[SPEAKER_11]: time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mentioned it before.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll mention it again.
[SPEAKER_11]: It brushes even better.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll clean out all the holes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then of course guaranteed what we just
did was we created another level of sift
[SPEAKER_07]: underneath.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that one then?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we called this seconds before
exactly because when we collected it,
[SPEAKER_11]: it wasn't firsts.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it still had a little bit of
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing that usually will hit down
here is going to be the first grade,
[SPEAKER_11]: but that's only off the first initial
bounce on the two screens when you move
[SPEAKER_11]: them both and collect.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already collected that, moved the
bud a secondary time on that screen,
[SPEAKER_11]: to get it to collect and then collected
the screen off this screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we're collecting now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a seconds for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: These sifts are still much cleaner than
what most people's sifts would be
[SPEAKER_11]: considered.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we're calling it first and second,
but really what they are is like,
[SPEAKER_11]: this is 90 plus percent heads.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that other stuff that we, that we made
was literally like almost a hundred
[SPEAKER_11]: percent.
[SPEAKER_11]: I never like to say a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_11]: I call it 99.9, which is what I used to
call Sam's cleanest dry sift.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which carding techniques we'll do.
[SPEAKER_11]: This trick we'll do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam can do it with his technique.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are ways to get resin to this level
of cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you really want to just do it and not
be worried about the cost, go get yourself
[SPEAKER_11]: a Rotape machine.
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple grand for those.
[SPEAKER_11]: You might be able to get one for under a
grand at an auction.
[SPEAKER_11]: What?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's a Rotape machine?
[SPEAKER_11]: A Rotape machine is one of those round
pharmaceutical grade separation vibrator
[SPEAKER_11]: machines.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The stacks of screens that I have.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have one of those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: They fit into the Rotape.
[SPEAKER_11]: They, they usually, if it's a good unit
and you can dial it in pretty,
[SPEAKER_11]: you can get.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a small one at the other place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can usually get a pretty good grade as
well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's all these different ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, for what, what Matt's doing
here, big screens like this makes sense
[SPEAKER_11]: because he's already using screens over
this.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's already collecting the resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's already seeding out bud and growing
bud.
[SPEAKER_11]: It needs to be de-stocked or trimmed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is, uh, this is something he's
already doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now he just has a trick to remove some of
the nicest heads first before he collects
[SPEAKER_11]: the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, but hopefully I'll get to clean up
later.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're back.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our last tub of the shishka.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: The shishka ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: The barbola.
[SPEAKER_11]: Serious barbola.
[SPEAKER_11]: Barbed in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The color.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really just everything about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of can't say enough about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like this is reminiscent of, I guess,
I guess because this is what I had in the
[SPEAKER_11]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is like, when do you get to see stuff
you had in the nineties?
[SPEAKER_07]: I sort of went into a bubble, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't, for me it was just, I was
devouring my own flavors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once in a while you find something that's
like, wow, man, I'm going to add that to
[SPEAKER_07]: the can.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, I missed the whole sort of Kush
era.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stoked that you did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kush is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand how potent it is,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a Kush fan.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I've always been a bit harsh on the
Kush vibes in the sense that Kush is a
[SPEAKER_11]: great productive, um, commercial strain in
the sense that people that might not be
[SPEAKER_11]: able to grow other things could come out
successful with growing the Kush.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was always into sativas.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I damn near broke into tears
when you hand me these sweets gunk
[SPEAKER_11]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just, uh, I had it years ago,
[SPEAKER_11]: but lost it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course everyone's always like,
oh, you can have anything you want.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right up until you ask for it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_11]: Super stoked on barbs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cher.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cher.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not Cher?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if it's good, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go there and I can use it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It brings a whole new meaning to Sonny and
Cher.
[SPEAKER_11]: You ever, uh, interested in doing some
greenhouse work?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm interested all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm interested in going to Denmark and
seeing some of those outdoor fields and
[SPEAKER_07]: going to, you know, going to places in the
Middle East you're allowed to go to,
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cher, Turkey and things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing the hash production.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that would be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big world out there and it seems like with
cannabis that, uh, it seems to be opening
[SPEAKER_11]: up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I even had friends of mine that are seed
sellers out of, uh, Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_11]: tell me in just this last year that
they've been getting lots of people from
[SPEAKER_11]: the Middle East coming and buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're, you know, they're kind of
like, don't they like put you to death
[SPEAKER_11]: there for that stuff?
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I guess to a point they do,
but I guess even there it's getting cooler
[SPEAKER_11]: because for people to even consider such a
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you start, why don't you start
healing people?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily healing people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you bring comfort of life back
to people, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to deny.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to deny the grandma that,
you know, is in pain and someone gave her
[SPEAKER_07]: a tank chair and she's not in pain
anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a huge eye opener.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the big story for me was always,
uh, Lester Grinspoon talking about his son
[SPEAKER_11]: and how, uh, you know, after he basically,
this was years ago, decades ago,
[SPEAKER_11]: and he was using it medicinally.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm pretty sure he was quite young,
like 11 or 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lester's son.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't quote me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think his son and his son's name would
have been Danny.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, he was sick, getting chemotherapy and
every day after chemotherapy, every time
[SPEAKER_11]: they would go back home and, uh,
you know, he would retch for hours because
[SPEAKER_11]: it was harsh poisons poisoning his body.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so when he finally broke down and
allowed him to, you know, to consider to
[SPEAKER_11]: use cannabis as a medicine, there weren't
all these fancy vaporizers or all these
[SPEAKER_11]: things.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he had smoked a joint just out in front
of the hospital.
[SPEAKER_11]: And after chemotherapy that day,
instead of going home and retching for
[SPEAKER_11]: eight hours, he was, he asked his parents
excitingly in the car ride home,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, could, could we stop for a
submarine sandwich?
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is like, that's a pretty huge
quality of life change, particularly for a
[SPEAKER_11]: child.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause we never want, I mean, we never want
to see people suffer generally,
[SPEAKER_11]: but something about a child suffering that
is even more devastating, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: you just don't want children to suffer.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was always, I found that to be a very
powerful story that Lester told.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it must've been an interview because
I've heard it in his words, him telling
[SPEAKER_11]: the story.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some pretty powerful stories out
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember a guy named Ronald Ranger from
the Vicks and Ronald Ranger, he was just a
[SPEAKER_07]: regular guy, but he had glaucoma and he
had glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had a bunch of other things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it wasn't, you know, it wasn't the
healthiest guy, but his glaucoma would
[SPEAKER_07]: take his sight away.
[SPEAKER_07]: And back in the day, he knew cannabis when
he smoked it, he could see, like he,
[SPEAKER_07]: like he couldn't be able to see you or I,
but he can do shapes and he could maneuver
[SPEAKER_07]: around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if he didn't have cannabis and the
pressure on his eye would build up to the
[SPEAKER_07]: point where he couldn't see.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and in the scope of this guy's life,
he in the, in to find cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: he had to go out on the street,
sometimes blind, looking for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was dragged into an alley on
Newman's times, raped, and sodomized
[SPEAKER_07]: because this guy wanted to find weed so he
could see.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we came across that story.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like to this day, I can't tell the story
without, you know, feeling the emotion.
[SPEAKER_07]: This dude just wants to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't want to smoke weed to get high
or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy just wants to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, we came, we came across that
story and we supplied that guy weed for
[SPEAKER_07]: free for the rest of his life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Until Ronald Ranger passed away,
he smoked weed for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he just wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's worth it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, when it's your eyesight too,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's easy for a prohibitionist,
some sort of government types who are,
[SPEAKER_11]: have great eyesight and his family is all
healthy to not even consider things like
[SPEAKER_11]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you say to that guy?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't have, or you can't grow your
own.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't have the money to buy the large
production licenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your option?
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it away.
[SPEAKER_11]: We still have it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We still have it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We could still grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Such a nice bug.
[SPEAKER_07]: We could still grow the purple-y,
almost blue.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a blue aspect.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like a blue tinge to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially on some of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just your eyes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice fall colors on that canvas.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get those colors.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want those colors like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta learn to flush your weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't flush your weed, you won't
see the crazy colors.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get the plants to go yellow first.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then once they all go yellow,
that's when your reds and your purples and
[SPEAKER_07]: your oranges and all these amazing colors
that lie within these plants come out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And are you getting that in a two,
three, four week flush?
[SPEAKER_07]: Four, yeah, five.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a room right now that's on its
eighth week of just water.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a John Key room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've fed it for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It flowered.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fed it for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the last eight weeks of its life,
we just gave it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just gave it to the water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm giving my crop just water now.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in its last four and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Finishing up the last few.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's gonna be a nice one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they all are.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll try not to move the bud too much.
We're back.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've lifted up our 180 micron screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: We put the bud over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see there's resin on top of this
screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: We put it over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is our number one grade.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is our first grade.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the light, light, light sixth
grade.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the first thing that we got from
breaking up all that bud over those two
[SPEAKER_11]: screens.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, there's more to get,
but this quality will be near pure heads.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those ripples are throwing me off.
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep hitting them when it's like a car
accident.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a dry sift accident.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, this is nice quality.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a great way for anyone who's
already sifted or sifting or growing to
[SPEAKER_11]: collect a really incredible quality of
sift.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that is really a nice quality
without too much, really without doing
[SPEAKER_11]: much different at all, just specific
screen sizes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Press that in your hand that fast.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, drop it on there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love to see the contrast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Snaked right up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's basically the first thing you
want to do if you're dry sifting and you
[SPEAKER_11]: want to collect the best heads possible
from there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can bash the herb more and collect it
under the screens and then basically do
[SPEAKER_11]: what we're about to do, which is take that
bin or that tub full of the barb that
[SPEAKER_11]: we've destocked and done this like dry
sifting with.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I guess we'll be taking it down
to Matt's industrial size machine and
[SPEAKER_11]: giving it a 10 minute, a one hour and a 24
hour.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to be here for all of those,
but I'll definitely be here when it goes
[SPEAKER_11]: in for the 10 minute and show you what we
get out of that as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can clearly see that contaminant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it'd be cool to get that picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice Easton second season of Trump with
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Officer man, what do you want from me?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you dreadlock.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to stop people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't respect the law when the law
says stop people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an ancient tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a gift to the wise and a long time
they must be in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention African.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best indeed in the West Indies burning
by the rivers of Babylon.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, boy!
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastaman willow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you have it with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastaman willow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, I feel so eased out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you have no fear?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel so eased out and don't you judge me
by my hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was walking down the street and I woke
up in an old B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Said that I smell of the good old trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastaman, what can you do for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastaman willow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you have it with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastaman willow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, I feel so eased out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you have no fear?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel so eased out and don't you judge me
by my hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was walking down the street and I woke
up in an old B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Said that I smell of the good old trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: One man to make up the road with me and
the old blue sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you expect upon get priest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ready for D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't disturb my peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, how's it going, everyone?
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the Warlock Kanatonix High CBD
Warlock.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got hit in the face by this one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it was this one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I smelt it and it was awesome,
but then this one brushed up against my
[SPEAKER_11]: shoulder and I could smell it from over
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any fans of the Warlock out there?
[SPEAKER_07]: We've acquired a High CBD version of the
Warlock.
Warlock fan.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a Warlock fan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything up there is High CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: High CBD version.
[SPEAKER_07]: High CBD Rene?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's the RC7.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the only phenotype out of 500 seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the only phenotype that we kept that
doesn't have a High CBD content,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's a beast.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such a beast that we were like,
we're keeping it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only keep so many plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you don't get rid of one that's that
special.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those times you run into a strain
like that and you keep it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_07]: If everybody remembers, that was the one
that had the Afghani bed structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the one.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it flowered, it produced the
Kanatonix bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sure has the Kanatonix bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other plants that had the Kanatonix
bed to grow, actually created the Afghani
[SPEAKER_07]: bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the beautiful thing about
genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are our three tubs of barb.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just mostly use my hand and arm to
block.
[SPEAKER_12]: Geez, I'm not a big enough person to block
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: This, for us, has two purposes.
[SPEAKER_07]: One, obviously, we get hash from it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other one is the tumbling action.
[SPEAKER_07]: It breaks the buds apart and releases all
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not all of them, but a good chunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: As anybody knows, that's cleaned seeds
before.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a long and slow process sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially on one of those fancy machines.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's some pretty fancy ones,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Green and glands.
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting dirty at the house of the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good solid, I don't know what,
but many pounds of weed just went in
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say two.
[SPEAKER_11]: Two pounds?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably only two.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll call that two plus.
[SPEAKER_11]: Two plus.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you're right in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Four forty-two.
[SPEAKER_11]: Four forty-two.
[SPEAKER_11]: Geez, it's only been twenty-two minutes
since we hit our 420 rep.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll plug this in, so at four fifty-two,
see what we get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back in ten minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I always used to do is knock that
off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that we've done that double screen
technique, I'm thinking, because if you
[SPEAKER_05]: look at this, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like hairs, and you can see them poke
it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always used to rub it, but now I don't
want to rub it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe collect it separately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, get everything out that's underneath
it first.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, pull the tub out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Never a bad idea to be learning new
things.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't really have to change much
and just be a little more careful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, that is a healthy pile of resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought a whole stack in, but I think I
gave half of it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite thick enough yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not bad at all.

[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Afghani Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Afghani Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it had the Afghani structure,
but it grew out to a Kanatonic style
[SPEAKER_11]: shape.
[SPEAKER_10]: They filled it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: A ten-minuter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember from the stuff that I've cleaned
in the past of yours, ten minutes was a
[SPEAKER_12]: joy to clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming to Toronto.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring us to Toronto with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suspect if you're there that some of it
will be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: With like a hundred different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you tried this bar before?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be like, yeah, where did you get it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I just met the guy on like an
elevator.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just gave me this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are some of the funniest stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

them out.

Vancouver Island, but I got to head back
[SPEAKER_11]: home.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go see Matt.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's just working in one of the far rooms
that they've been building up.
[SPEAKER_11]: And since we got here, when I got here
earlier, they were literally cleaning the
[SPEAKER_11]: bases for his tables, for the draining of
the water.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were cleaning those.
[SPEAKER_11]: The room was completely cleaned.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now they've actually got plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, some several hundred plants
transplanted and planted into this room.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm all packed up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been an amazing trip.

future.

skunk.
