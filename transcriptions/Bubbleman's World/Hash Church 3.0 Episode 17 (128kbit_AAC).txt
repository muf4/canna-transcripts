[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome everybody to Hash Church 3.0
episode 17.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still going.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just can't be stopped.
[SPEAKER_09]: These people just have nothing else to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just need Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all need Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so here we are on a Sunday morning,
bright and early.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we're not on Clubhouse right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: So welcome to everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to Johnny B and Etienne.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Hemp Guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And everyone else that's going to show up
here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_09]: How the hell are you guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Rock, paper, roll.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm loading up a bowl and doing the first
thing we need to do.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is my first rip of the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Super Bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it Super Bowl Sunday, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_17]: In this bowl it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got some first bounce cleaned up nicely
and hitting it on the old school.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's kind of like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lighten it with the lighter old school
style.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember doing that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I need matches.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for the tip there.
[SPEAKER_17]: The matches are the best way of actually
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I used to use the hemp line all the time,
but I kept going out.
[SPEAKER_17]: I kept tasting the hemp lick and I was
like.
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta be careful with the hemp line.
[SPEAKER_17]: When you use the lighter, you gotta use it
and then you pull.
[SPEAKER_17]: Taste that butane.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it really, really is kind of like,
I know.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm using Remo today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remo.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the Ames Institute.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be Dr. Allison in the
house, balancing out all this male energy
[SPEAKER_09]: with some wonderful female energy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_17]: This temple flow, raws and bubble is a
killer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning, Allison.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: I am recovering from a long day of
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can hear it in your voice.
[SPEAKER_09]: You had a really good day, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at a ladies retreat.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, it wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_07]: No spiritual enlightenment was found.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody stayed grounded.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started the day with I led a
ketamine assisted spiritual journey for
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody but myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was the sitter and then I don't think
we ate breakfast and went straight into
[SPEAKER_05]: MDMA and LSD and enjoyed the snow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that I think carried on into really
way into the night.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we ate a meal yesterday,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like AC Braddock made, we did eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: AC Braddock made this amazing African
peanut soup with prawns in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was our meal for the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was an interesting day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a group of ladies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had peanuts in it, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever heard of staying away from
peanuts before an Ayahuasca trip?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've heard of going vegan before an
Ayahuasca trip but not peanuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I've never.
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend Sean got pretty into it and he
was really focused on the diet and he
[SPEAKER_09]: started creating a list of foods that
should absolutely be avoided through his
[SPEAKER_09]: own bioassay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And man, he said that the eating of
peanuts was probably one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_09]: mistakes he ever did before an Ayahuasca
trip.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess it just, for whatever reason,
those particular peanuts interacted in a
[SPEAKER_09]: bad way and just caused him just an
excessive amount of purging.
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably the worst thing to eat before an
Ayahuasca is the musical fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, the musical fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't Ayahuasca kind of like ketamine in
the sense that you usually get nauseous?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know when I was given ketamine,
I was moving so fast in my brain that I
[SPEAKER_07]: got nauseous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ketamine, there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think everyone yesterday who took
all the other drugs as well was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: ketamine is very different than any drug,
including Ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ayahuasca can tend to cause an evacuation,
either the front, the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so having a diet that has like no
dairy and no meats can help minimize that
[SPEAKER_05]: evacuation process, if it will.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're still holding on to a lot of
emotional and psychic material,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to purge or get nauseous
either way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I find that with ketamine,
especially with my chronic pain patients
[SPEAKER_05]: who've been holding on to pain and
emotional trauma on a cellular level,
[SPEAKER_05]: they tend to get nauseous and throw up as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of purging.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yesterday, thankfully, nobody got
nauseous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody threw up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a really positive beginning to
the start of the women's retreat.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we like to hear.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just so glad you could pop in for
a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'd hope that like some of these
other ladies would.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, I left them at like two
in the morning because I had tapped out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, doing that many different drugs,
I think they might be sleeping right now,
[SPEAKER_07]: considering you started off with the
ketamine and MDMA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a robust day of
psychonauting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was snowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was also some snow trail walking
and some hot tubbing and some other art
[SPEAKER_05]: making.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was we set pure intentions for the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started out where we talked about what
we wanted to achieve and we're achieving
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning, Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you consider ketamine a true
psychedelic or is it just a very strong
[SPEAKER_14]: depersonalization drug?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's a really good question,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the intent and purposes of our clinic,
I would say that it causes an ego death
[SPEAKER_05]: and that therein lies the property of
psychedelics that we can use
[SPEAKER_05]: therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that it depends on who you talk
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a veterinarian probably wouldn't say
that, oh, yeah, I can't immune
[SPEAKER_05]: psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the Ames Institute, we consider it
psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was quite.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, I remember going to a
psychedelic conference in Whistler that
[SPEAKER_09]: had everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the it was the whole gamut.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it might have been in like the
early 2000s or the very late 90s.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I met a guy there who is a very small
community in the 90s in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_09]: The psychedelic community was just this
fraction of the cannabis community that
[SPEAKER_09]: would kind of travel around.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you could meet these key people and
very easy to meet almost the entire
[SPEAKER_09]: community at a single one or two events.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I met a guy, a real tripper,
and he would he told me, like,
[SPEAKER_09]: by far his favorite psychedelic experience
with intermuscular injections of ketamine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was literally like, I leave my
body.
[SPEAKER_09]: I fly through the universe.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can go and visit planets.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can I can go around stars.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was just like, holy shit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I thought I was hardcore with five
grams of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: This motherfucker's intermuscular
injecting ketamine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ketamine really gives a separation of
like, especially I mean, some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: ladies yesterday did have out of body
experiences.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them who are more psychonauts tend
to will probably want to move forward with
[SPEAKER_05]: an intramuscular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to experience that real true out of
body experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say that any of I've done a lot of
psychedelics and ketamine is just very
[SPEAKER_05]: different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yet and yet I would consider it
psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any any assistance she would suggest for
the come out for one thing I didn't like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I only did it once and it was
intermuscular.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Lilly's assistant gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hated the come out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took so long because I guess if the
dosage were given one tenth of what they
[SPEAKER_07]: give a child for surgery, I guess was what
was administered.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any suggestion for the come out
of that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it took so long.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just was very uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you take any Zofran or any type of
anti nausea with it?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all got nauseous during it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always keep that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I always keep some Zofran on me,
just a dissolvable tablet of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In our office, we give dissolvable tablets
and we also do, especially if someone's on
[SPEAKER_05]: their journey and they're starting to get
really nauseous, we'll give them an
[SPEAKER_05]: injection and it helps dramatically.
[SPEAKER_14]: I found that what ketamine reminded me the
most of was PCP.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's exactly like this, that, and the
other.
[SPEAKER_11]: And well, I suppose it can be at times,
but it's very much on its own at times,
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, in terms of a chemical.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I agree.
[SPEAKER_11]: My first time taking it, I concur with
Sam, it was pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just too heavy.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the next few times was much more
manageable because of the just a lower
[SPEAKER_11]: dose.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was more accurate.
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't, here, try this.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't because it was too strong.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was not, I mean, I've taken STP,
for God sakes.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's just a really different high than
what I consider psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: LSD, DMT, all of these type of drugs,
mescaline, psilocybin, they're absolutely
[SPEAKER_14]: true psychedelics without anybody's doubt.
[SPEAKER_14]: Whereas I have my doubts about ketamine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that people are actually
experiencing what they think they're
[SPEAKER_14]: experiencing?
[SPEAKER_14]: Or do you think it's all just an illusion
as a result of their ego death?
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have an opinion?
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have an opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they really are experiencing
what they're experiencing in their mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it takes them into the
other reality, the other realm,
[SPEAKER_05]: wherever that might be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's enough people and studies that
show that with that ego death,
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're inside their unconscious
mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I hear what you're saying,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were able in our office to use true
psychedelic plant medicine, we would be
[SPEAKER_05]: using it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're trying.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because ketamine does have psychedelic
properties and it does show the healing
[SPEAKER_05]: properties for people with trauma and
mental illness who are seeking relief we
[SPEAKER_05]: have to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of our gateway into
psychedelic assisted therapy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I always called ketamine the Cadillac of
PCPs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear what you guys were saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember in my 20s taking it at a club
in Miami and people were like,
[SPEAKER_05]: don't take too much because you don't want
to end up in a K-hole.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember it was really heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like I was my legs were
disconnected from the floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now as I'm older and I take it for
like a therapeutic purpose, I'm actually
[SPEAKER_05]: wanting to be in that K-hole.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to go and delve into my mind.
[SPEAKER_16]: Angel dust, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Fencyclidine was always like sprinkled on
bowls or there was always the rumor about
[SPEAKER_16]: weed that was laced with Fencyclidine.
[SPEAKER_09]: You like to get wet now?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I just always fretted that if you
look at the compound itself or just the
[SPEAKER_16]: structure of the compound that it's not
going to be thermally stable and it's
[SPEAKER_16]: going to degrade versus vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the cannabinoids, when you heat them
up, they vaporize.
[SPEAKER_16]: But these things contain nitrogens.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you heat up compounds that
contain nitrogens, they often degrade.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why all the psychedelics normally
like the phenethylamines are just water
[SPEAKER_16]: soluble and they're ingested and you don't
necessarily need to smoke stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just remember people getting all
spaced out because they were sprinkling
[SPEAKER_16]: white powder on their bowls.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm like, oh, no, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_16]: It just didn't seem right, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but you don't have to do it that
way.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can turn PCP into a base and use
ethanol to soak it into any herb.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, like like the sophisticated
deadheads who used to drop.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I remember Ketamine on Grateful Dead
tour in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I remember specifically people who
enjoyed taking it during in the second set
[SPEAKER_16]: of The Dead Show.
[SPEAKER_16]: There was always something called drums in
space and it got really spacey like they
[SPEAKER_16]: went into their percussion solos and there
were just lights.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just really it was like the most
psychedelically intense part of the show.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's when people busted out the K.
[SPEAKER_16]: And usually it was like an Afrin spray
bottle, like a nasal spray.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they take it and you see people like
they'd be like this and then they'd be
[SPEAKER_16]: like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you know what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mark, can you actually smoke or vaporize
ketamine?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I don't know, Sam.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I just when I look at the so the
chemical structure of those are related.
[SPEAKER_16]: So phencyclidine and ketamine are not
phenethylamines, but they're so they're
[SPEAKER_16]: not like LDOPE and they're not like
amphetamines.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're they're actually benzalamines and
they're they're different in that they
[SPEAKER_16]: have just a different set of chemistry
they hit.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think, Allison, don't they hit the NDMA
receptor and methyl deaspartic acid
[SPEAKER_16]: receptor?
[SPEAKER_16]: Which has peripheral impact on the whole
central nervous system, which is why they
[SPEAKER_16]: use these things as as animal
tranquilizers.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to say that I was young and
stupid and I'm not recommending anybody
[SPEAKER_14]: smoke angel dust PCP.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe there's any redeeming
factor in it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's just too much of a
disassociative.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I saw this news blurb where that guy
Marcus Rogan up in BC, his little R&D
[SPEAKER_16]: thing is going to start looking at vape
smart.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like he's got like some kind of GC set up
that they're going to actually pull air
[SPEAKER_16]: through vapes to actually quantitate
different types of impurities and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_16]: You think they'd want to try to try that,
like put little bit of PCP like on some
[SPEAKER_16]: herb, burn it or something and see like
really what comes off because I always
[SPEAKER_16]: thought just looking at the structure,
I'm like, man, those things are going to
[SPEAKER_16]: degrade as soon as they heat up.
[SPEAKER_16]: So all those people who were smoking PCP
laced weed again, I think it has a lot to
[SPEAKER_16]: do with the same thing that people who
smoke that synthetic spice.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at that compound, that
compound, unlike cannabinoids is got a
[SPEAKER_16]: nitrogen in it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when those nitrogen compounds heat up,
they thermally eliminate through something
[SPEAKER_16]: called a cope rear.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_16]: What is the name of that degradation?
[SPEAKER_16]: It's called a Hoffman degradation.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hoffman degradations happen with nitrogen
containing compounds when you heat them
[SPEAKER_16]: up.
[SPEAKER_16]: Can't keep it from happening.
[SPEAKER_16]: You heat up nitrogen compounds in the
presence of air.
[SPEAKER_16]: They degrade to these really toxic
compounds called nitroso and nitrosamine
[SPEAKER_16]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of the most toxic shit we know in
mankind.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I mean, like that's what those people
were all freaked out seeing Jesus on back
[SPEAKER_16]: in the day when they were sprinkling that
shit on their bowls.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's funny because again, I think they
thought that this, wow, that's really
[SPEAKER_16]: potent.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, dude, you're probably smoking
all kinds of degradation, toxic
[SPEAKER_16]: degradation products and not even knowing
what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I don't think you can smoke it
to answer your question.
[SPEAKER_14]: No clinical trials were ever done.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, maybe a hundred of them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_16]: But you bring up a good point,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think, I think most of these,
because they're water soluble,
[SPEAKER_16]: you can make just a, like a, a spray and
internasal spray, you know, and just take
[SPEAKER_16]: a couple of hits and you're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, man, Mark, when you start with
these like science, you know, experiments
[SPEAKER_05]: so early in the morning, I'm like,
wow, I just get, I love it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a whole six hours to be thinking
about shit, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead, Colin.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, since we're talking about
compounds and as a young buck,
[SPEAKER_11]: when I was really into Otis Huxley and,
and reading more about what they were up
[SPEAKER_11]: to and his whole crew, I read about AMT,
right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, I took it and I read, when I read
about it, he described it as the Rolls
[SPEAKER_11]: Royce of L.A.
[SPEAKER_11]: LSD.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanted to just ask the question,
you know, Allison, what's your take on
[SPEAKER_11]: that?
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sam and everyone in the room as a
chemical, what's going on there?
[SPEAKER_11]: And can anyone shed any light on that?
[SPEAKER_11]: If it really is the Rolls Royce.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't hear, I didn't hear what compound
you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
AMT?
[SPEAKER_05]: AMT, not DMT?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, AMT.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not familiar with AMT.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not familiar with it, but I thought I
had taken everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, maybe I'm the only one.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's extremely long.
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got the initials wrong or
something.
[SPEAKER_14]: What does it stand for, AMT?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's, let's, let's look it up.
Google.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do some Google research.
[SPEAKER_11]: So alpha methyl tryptamine.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was described by Aldous Huxley as the
Rolls Royce of LSD.
[SPEAKER_11]: And at a time in my life, I was very much
learning about myself.
OK.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what you're saying is instead of
dimethyltryptamine, DMT, it's alpha methyl
[SPEAKER_14]: tryptamine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had some of the other tryptamines.
[SPEAKER_14]: In other words, like DET.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never seen a.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, neither have I.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I want to try it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very, very intense and long.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've taken it a few more than a few
times.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just, you know, I've had a couple of
times with a close friend of mine and we'd
[SPEAKER_11]: make music on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just remember him looking at me and
being like, is this forever?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, at one point it was so long,
abnormally long.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it was a very intense process.
It was very hard to control.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when you smoke it, does it smell
and taste better than DMT, which smells
[SPEAKER_14]: like burning plastic or burning metal?
[SPEAKER_11]: So the way that we did it, you know this
was not controlled.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was not controlled at the time when we
were getting the stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we would make it we would really study
the dosage and we would get it and make
[SPEAKER_11]: pills out of it and take it that way.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the onset was a much cleaner version
of coming on a cleaner onset than I'd ever
[SPEAKER_11]: seen from any other substance like this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was a very clear, almost
unbelievably psychedelic experience,
[SPEAKER_11]: but you're very cognitive and you're
riding that line of like surrealism.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you say it lasted a long time because
DMT or if you smoke it, it doesn't last 15
[SPEAKER_14]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's really fast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is like huge pink and valleys and
very expansive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I started to understand what Audis
Huxley was talking about immediately in
[SPEAKER_11]: the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, wow, this guy really knows
what's up at the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it was really incredible,
but I haven't heard much about it since.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really hear people talk about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I went through a phase of my life where I
was really into these compounds and
[SPEAKER_11]: started.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a time when you could disorder
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there was a time when you could
order DMT and 5-Myo and all these other
[SPEAKER_11]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was a very interesting point in my
life, but I think it was just curious.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just very curious.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really hear much about it,
but it truly was like sitting in that
[SPEAKER_11]: Rolls Royce, if you will.
[SPEAKER_11]: I started to understand it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if DMT is the working man psychedelic,
what would you call this one?
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you call it?
[SPEAKER_07]: The serious overtime?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like, well, it's like my buddy
Dan said, it was like, this seems
[SPEAKER_11]: abnormally long.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so that's all I remember.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so long ago, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like almost, you know, 15.
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you able to actually access time to
know if it was an hour, two hours,
[SPEAKER_07]: five hours?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You would be so out of sync with time and
then you'd be, you know, you come in and
[SPEAKER_11]: out of these peaks and valleys.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you will, whatever analogy we're going
to use.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you would just be like, wow,
it's like, what time is it?
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I do remember of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's been quite some time since I've
revisited this part of my journey.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I read about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Audis Huxley was someone I was reading a
lot about at the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And him and his whole crew just talked
about it like, hey, this is the Rolls
[SPEAKER_11]: Royce of LSD.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that analogy always stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, so that's why I asked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd never heard about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's in T-Cyle and he's got a prep for it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So those chemists who want to be out there
and be cowboys, he could actually make it
[SPEAKER_16]: if you want from tryptamine.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it has that alpha methyl group,
which is similar to NDMA, right,
[SPEAKER_16]: which has got an alpha methyl group,
too, as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it reminded me of AMT.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it reminded me of MDMA when the
onset is very much like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's all it's like it reminds me of
it was like this hybrid of all these
[SPEAKER_11]: things.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I started to understand why they were
talking about it in that light,
[SPEAKER_11]: because you're like, wow, the onset's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it just like all the blocks fit.
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't like, you know, like when you
eat mushrooms, your body's like,
[SPEAKER_11]: what are you doing to yourself?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there's this moment of this push
and pull and that you just I never
[SPEAKER_11]: experienced that with this.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I always like DMT because when you
take a big inhalation of it before you let
[SPEAKER_14]: it out, you're already on the top of the
rocket going a million miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's my question for the for the
chemical question for the day.
[SPEAKER_17]: I did try ketamine because when I was told
it was a horse tranquilizer and it might
[SPEAKER_17]: help with with pain.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then when Alison was talking about how
it felt disconnected, I felt like I was on
[SPEAKER_17]: the floor and I couldn't move and I was
moving at like a turtle speed minus like I
[SPEAKER_17]: couldn't even do anything.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thought like, how can I function
using this in life?
[SPEAKER_17]: So hence hash is the go to for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But well, but I would tell you use smaller
amounts, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just curious because everybody's been
talking even about what psychedelics we
[SPEAKER_04]: utilize.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do utilize ketamine for chronic pain in
our clinic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we use what's called like troches or
lozenges.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I usually work with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, of course, it's Dr. Agarwal,
who's the one that prescribes it and tells
[SPEAKER_05]: them what to take.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I work with them on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: To make sure that like you're on the right
track.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we usually start with a quarter of a
troche.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be like maybe twenty five
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm curious now because between I've
always taken lots of mushrooms and then
[SPEAKER_17]: like a reset, but I've never done the
micros and I've always done excess amounts
[SPEAKER_17]: of different drugs to try and see if it
would help me.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I've never done small amounts where I
can't feel it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So now I'm kind of reassessing things by
listening to people on clubhouse and
[SPEAKER_17]: talking here.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm kind of in this whole new OK.
[SPEAKER_17]: I take two hundred fifty milligram caps
like three times a day.
[SPEAKER_17]: And my my my my points are getting that
I'm taking too much.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm trying to like I take in like
resets on days where I don't like do
[SPEAKER_17]: doubts or smoke weed for the whole day.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now I'm doing this every month and stuff
like that, trying to find things that are
[SPEAKER_17]: going to work more.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm kind of curious about this next
step of being able to deal with with
[SPEAKER_17]: chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say that if you're using
plant medicine, and plant medicine,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're able to get it to work for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would use plant medicine until you max
out on that medicine is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like let's talk about adding
ketamine if plant medicine no longer works
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have options now, even with a
psilocybin can also help with pain.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to welcome Josh into the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw him just kind of sneak in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going, buddy?
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy Valentine's Day to everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And my lovely Valentine will probably be
down here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And wonderful conversation this morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: So good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Valentine's Day.
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy love to you all.
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy V-Day to everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be taking my wife for a romantic
walk in the forest later tonight up in
[SPEAKER_09]: through the trees and the snow.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my Valentine's Day plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not buying cards and flowers and
candies and chocolate and teddy bears and
[SPEAKER_09]: all that sort of, you know, pardon my
French bullshit, but I am going to spend
[SPEAKER_09]: time with her and appreciate her and
appreciate our vibes and do it in nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: My wife and I are going to out to a fancy
restaurant at the drive-through at
[SPEAKER_07]: In-N-Out tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, type of in-service dining
that I can accompany me during this COVID.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, my partner, he gave me the
freedom to be with my ladies for this
[SPEAKER_05]: weekend as my Valentine's Day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's out with his men friends,
all camping.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we just try to express love
every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rather than one day a year.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one day we're going to have to
have our wives do an episode of Hash
[SPEAKER_09]: Church and not any of us and just have our
wives on here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be absolutely
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just telling stories, talking shit about
us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kelly could moderate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's always here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the women that are on Hash Church,
do they bring their husbands?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, why not?
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be pretty, I think it would just be a
fun fun thing one day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I know, I mean, has anyone ever seen
my wife, that's Chan's wife, Dr. Park's
[SPEAKER_09]: wife, like Colin's wife?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam, I bet you, I bet you your lady would
like to come on Hash Church and bust out a
[SPEAKER_09]: few old Sam stories.
[SPEAKER_11]: She'd be talking about herbalism the whole
time and how I, you know, pack too many
[SPEAKER_11]: balls.
[SPEAKER_17]: You've been with your wife since high
school, haven't you?
[SPEAKER_17]: Like when you guys like first dated and
you guys have been together ever since.
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys have quite a love story,
actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I think Sam is in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've seen his pictures of him and
his wife.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were kids.
[SPEAKER_11]: 53 years?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations for her being able to put
up with you that long.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, what a trooper.
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be 53 years.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 52 right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: How about Wade?
[SPEAKER_13]: How about Wade and Monica?
[SPEAKER_17]: She's a skunk.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, here's to you guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: 31 here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm 31 as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm 31 as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: 1989.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'm 32.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have had long-term relationships.
[SPEAKER_09]: Had a long-term relationship.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can't tell Allison, most of the
guys on this panel, are extremely
[SPEAKER_09]: committed to what they are committed to.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just committed.
[SPEAKER_09]: We should all be committed.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, whether it's hash or marriages or
relationships, I love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nine years before we tied the old knotter
and we've been together for a really long
[SPEAKER_11]: time, like almost two decades.
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to know when you're content,
right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that like one of the secrets of
life?
[SPEAKER_16]: Like really separating happiness from
being content.
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything in life is just a matter of
choices.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the choice of being right or
being happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Choose appropriately.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to make compromises.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're smart, you have some idea of
what life is going to be with that person
[SPEAKER_14]: in five or 10 years, at least.
[SPEAKER_14]: In America, marriage is just another
throwaway consumer item, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_14]: More than half the people who marry get
divorced.
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you know people who got married were
one of the partners consumed and the other
[SPEAKER_16]: one did not?
[SPEAKER_16]: Those marriages never lasted, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Want to make a bet?
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm asking that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_14]: My wife does not puff.
[SPEAKER_14]: If she was to puff, she would puff CBD to
go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_14]: She does not smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just at this age, she's not into Delta 9
or GHCA.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me rephrase that.
[SPEAKER_16]: The marriages where one was pro and the
other was totally against.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know several marriages where weed
consumption was basically the reason why
[SPEAKER_16]: the marriage ended.
[SPEAKER_07]: My original marriage, which I got married
at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_07]: we were both proponents of cannabis,
but after we were married a few years,
[SPEAKER_07]: she stopped and we grew apart.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a problem for us and it didn't get
any better until we finally divorced.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think alcohol would be number one in
that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think we should be talking about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: We should talk about how alcohol ruins
relationships.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think cannabis saves relationships,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I could be with anyone who
didn't use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried and it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's neat about that is that people use
cannabis differently now.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use cannabis by eating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to be getting high to be
using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: My wife does all three of those things
that I just mentioned, but she has no
[SPEAKER_09]: interest in smoking cannabis to alter her
consciousness with THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's a little sensitive to the THC,
but she enjoys all of the other things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess in that sense, people still enjoy
cannabis.
That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have someone that supports you,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call them a square.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a square and they find out you
use between two and five grams a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: To them, that is like, whoa, you've got a
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You smoke too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was talking about this recently with my
wife in regards to how we celebrate our
[SPEAKER_09]: celebrations and our successes,
but we don't really celebrate the hard
[SPEAKER_09]: road and the things that define us to
becoming who we are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because my successes do not define me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my failures, my difficult road that I
took.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all the bad pictures I took that
create the good ones that I take.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a mentality I wish human beings
had a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_09]: We love to promote the podium and the
pedestal, but we don't really promote the
[SPEAKER_09]: whole difficult, hard, gnarly road that it
takes to get there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think sometimes manifesting that
experience where you're a user and the
[SPEAKER_09]: other person is not a user is all part of
that defining who you are.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's interesting that a lot of us
have been in long-term relationships.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even our son, Sky, and then Sierra,
they've been together for almost 10 years
[SPEAKER_13]: now.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're 24 years old.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think it is a good quality that we
have.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wade, how long have you been together with
Monica?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming on 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a previous marriage with the mother
of my children.
[SPEAKER_00]: She and I have managed to maintain being
good friends, but we came to understand we
[SPEAKER_00]: just couldn't live with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the mother of my children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you called me out, I wanted to jump
in here and say all this conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: about psychedelics and all of the alphabet
soup of various compounds that induce the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, not that it really matters,
but I personally only have experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: with LSD and mushrooms and cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all quite different,
but the central point that we keep making
[SPEAKER_00]: reference to has to do with ego death.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just look at each of us in turn
who have experienced these psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think any of us have a shortage of
ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our egos are still present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that we've come to realize that
all of this three-dimensional reality that
[SPEAKER_00]: we live in is just a construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really haven't been vibed in
psychedelics in probably as long as I've
[SPEAKER_00]: known Monica.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually recently sourced some high
quality LSD that we're considering sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: that experience together.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years, I have tried to remember what
the psychedelic experience taught me and
[SPEAKER_00]: build that experience in my head through I
suppose you could call it meditation or
[SPEAKER_00]: just really what I do is spend a lot of
time looking at nature and things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the garden and around us on
the farm and trying to see where I fit
[SPEAKER_00]: into that and where humans fit into it and
how we can work together with what we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to make this world a little sweeter place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to encourage and recommend
to people who have not tried the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic experience to do that because
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dramatically quick way to
understand the illusion that makes our
[SPEAKER_00]: world seem so real and to recognize the
true essence of who you are as a human
[SPEAKER_00]: being and what the opportunity for that
life is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems important to recognize that
all of these drugs including psychedelics
[SPEAKER_00]: really only help us glimpse the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't help us live it and you have to
do that work of living what's real for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs can help us see that and that's true
about cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I'm a missionary about cannabis and
its potential benefits for humans but
[SPEAKER_00]: what's true is it's an aid just like in
healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite analogies about healing
is that just like healing can happen in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital or as a result of taking some
prescription drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really true about healing is it
comes from within ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bodies heal themselves and in that
same way spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spirit can happen in a church or a temple
or a mosque but it really comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: within us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our experience of spirit that is
real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the church itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry to heavy up on you on a Sunday
morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can talk all day long.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is church.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate that too.
[SPEAKER_13]: We consider it an essential thing on our
property.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you want to say something else Wade?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that I feel such a deep respect for
this group of people and the platform that
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus has created and the way that each
of us is willing to be who you are and
[SPEAKER_00]: feel welcomed while doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well put.
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone in the chat just said Wade's voice
just lifts away all anxiety.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would suspect that Allison if you're
using ketamine currently to walk people
[SPEAKER_09]: through their journeys you might want to
look into using Wade's voice for some of
[SPEAKER_09]: the integration because man that is it's
all just rings true and it's all love and
[SPEAKER_09]: kind.
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone said it the other day Wade comes
out and opens his mouth and just showers
[SPEAKER_09]: everyone with love and gold nuggets and I
just you know what that's really funny as
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sitting here I'm waiting for my coffee
whatever I shared with one of the ladies
[SPEAKER_05]: that like you know about about Wade and
how beautiful his words come out and and
[SPEAKER_05]: how it's easy to be drawn because it's
just everything is with love and
[SPEAKER_05]: positivity.
[SPEAKER_07]: He has a warmth about him when he speaks
but it also it comes from a well of
[SPEAKER_07]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: It isn't just spouting anything if you can
hear the wealth the wealth of knowledge
[SPEAKER_07]: and the depth of the person within.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is yeah I would recommend having him
narrate anything you need.
[SPEAKER_14]: To tell you the truth I patented all of
that knowledge so I actually own it and if
[SPEAKER_14]: anybody wants to use Wade's knowledge they
have to pay me royalties.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you Sam.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the only way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you take royalties and hash?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll take good karma.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had someone ask that I would go on
my podcast mic so hopefully that sounds a
[SPEAKER_08]: little better.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've turned off the air pods and I've
turned on the raspberry microphone.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't sound like you're in a tin can.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent well I should have known that
earlier thanks for mentioning that BDNF
[SPEAKER_08]: guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on my good mic now.
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you smoking on right now man?
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey guys how are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_15]: You're rolling it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah man I'm loving the conversation you
guys are getting more into the
[SPEAKER_15]: psychedelics like every every week it's
it's awesome man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a little I take I take microdosing
almost three four or five times a week of
[SPEAKER_15]: psilocybin and I've had a few journeys but
I don't go too much past that acid a few
[SPEAKER_15]: times but the microdose for the psilocybin
really is something that's proven really
[SPEAKER_15]: beneficial to me to you know like usually
I use it when I'm really tired and and I
[SPEAKER_15]: don't have as much patience within myself
to be kind and I take the psilocybin and
[SPEAKER_15]: it just gives me that empathy and that
understanding of kind of where I am in the
[SPEAKER_15]: scene and so it's been a good practice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to be that empathy does not lie
in the ego.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome Josh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Etienne I have a message for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: AC says to tell you hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_05]: She said to tell you she loves you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much love and great respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Much love and great respect she said.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get any hellos from AC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh and now Marcus is upset AC because you
know she said she loves you too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well just from the Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragonfly Josh from Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean you guys are in my in my ear so she
can't actually hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: She hears me talking to you but she can't
actually hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hold on I'm going to take my earbud out
and let her hear you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great AC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your how was your psychedelic
trips yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh it was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know then there's tonight now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rinse, lather, repeat huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I had never done a ketamine session
like that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had one gal who'd never quite made
the connection between psychedelics and
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine and healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she made that connection yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's that's all part of the
connection that we need in this time and
[SPEAKER_13]: this difficult time that often wants to
connect us from the sacred and disconnect
[SPEAKER_13]: us from our self empowered place.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think psychedelics breaks that chain
right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like the mycelium just like the roots
just like fungi as a whole breaks rules.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no rules in fungi and also
psychedelics follow that line.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's part of that just breaking
the programming.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're in like an everyday programming of
news and food and medicine and all this
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it takes the power of
something like psychedelics and all the
[SPEAKER_13]: different forms to truly break that chain
and show us what's important which a lot
[SPEAKER_13]: of times resides in the heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: My intention going in was something a
little different but where it took me was
[SPEAKER_02]: all about connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything you're just saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have lost our connection to so many
things and each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a good way to get it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: If only everyone would do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny that bands that work.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny like bands like the Grateful
Dead and Fish and some other bands have
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of figured this out that you know
there's a there's different ways to get
[SPEAKER_08]: connections and plant medicines are
definitely on the list.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know the experiences I had
particularly at fish shows certainly
[SPEAKER_08]: weren't alcohol influence.
[SPEAKER_08]: They seem to be psychedelic influence like
lots of people just not only looking to
[SPEAKER_08]: connect through the set and setting which
is the show but also that parking lot vibe
[SPEAKER_08]: and just you know like people just looking
for that so desperately.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean people followed that band around
for 30 plus years for a reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know like not just because because
there was a hole there was something
[SPEAKER_08]: missing and when you go on tour I felt it
myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt like that hole got filled.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like oh my god these are my people
like there's so many like minded people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can have so many amazing conversations
and experiences and I can do it while fish
[SPEAKER_08]: is melting my brain with a beautiful split
open and melt jam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all the kindness that
surrounds it the kindness and the
[SPEAKER_02]: creativity and just openness to actually
meet other people and make those kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: connections.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for us who didn't have access to the
drugs or the scenes I mean we heard about
[SPEAKER_07]: the scene and that's what drove me to
shake down street was dude they've got
[SPEAKER_07]: every drug available.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's people walk around with mushrooms
and I'll be damned if some guy doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: walk around with a 25 gram Anita going
mushrooms mushrooms you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget your balls with armpit hairs
in them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: In your Guatemalan shorts and your tie-dye
t-shirts and your jewelry and yeah just
[SPEAKER_16]: anything that you need to look like a
hippie.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_16]: I started at the age of 14 seeing those
guys and it was just yeah I was like wow
[SPEAKER_16]: and you know and living in northern New
Jersey it was easy growing up in the late
[SPEAKER_16]: 70s early 80s to go see the Grateful Dead
by just traveling like a two hour circle
[SPEAKER_16]: around New York City.
[SPEAKER_16]: Literally see hundreds of shows and not
have to travel too far but there was like
[SPEAKER_16]: a spirit of adventure because you didn't
always have tickets right and you're like
[SPEAKER_16]: driving and it was before cell phones so
you're unable to hook up with people until
[SPEAKER_16]: you got there and unlike today it wasn't
broadcasted to the world so to be there to
[SPEAKER_16]: witness the magic you had to be in the
building.
[SPEAKER_16]: You needed a piece of a little ticket that
got you into the building and if you're
[SPEAKER_16]: lucky like with dead and Mark or remember
with fish you're actually got a tape of
[SPEAKER_16]: the show like the next day and you're
listening to the show that you just saw
[SPEAKER_16]: that just blew your mind and now you have
it on tape for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just such an incredible adventure
to live and Fish had this incredible
[SPEAKER_16]: crescendo after Garcia died in 95.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they were certainly the heirs
apparent for like the next traveling
[SPEAKER_16]: circus the next large traveling circus.
[SPEAKER_16]: They already had an incredible body of
music and they were being incredibly
[SPEAKER_16]: creative at the time and just like the
dead they weren't the commercial success
[SPEAKER_16]: but they let people tour and they let
people tape and that whole shakedown
[SPEAKER_16]: street like when the fish show rolled into
town it was just like the dead.
[SPEAKER_16]: They needed to give them their own parking
lot.
[SPEAKER_16]: There were campers there were teepees.
[SPEAKER_16]: There were just all kinds of just this
traveling circus that would travel around
[SPEAKER_16]: and that was part of the culture of the
music and you hit it on the head Mark.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was really unique because if you went
to like I don't know like an almond
[SPEAKER_16]: brother show or Neil Young there is never
a traveling circus associated with any
[SPEAKER_16]: other band.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean I guess on the jam band maybe at a
much lower level some of the bands had it
[SPEAKER_16]: but you know Fish had this sort of
crescendo all the way up to the Millennium
[SPEAKER_16]: and when they played their show at Big
Cypress in the Everglades it was the
[SPEAKER_16]: largest gathering on the planet for the
Millennium.
[SPEAKER_16]: The largest gathering was the fish show
that I was at along with my lovely wife a
[SPEAKER_16]: bunch of my friends.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was just it was incredible because
they played from midnight all throughout
[SPEAKER_16]: the night.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: How many people.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think was like eighty five thousand
people Marcus.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a big one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't at Seminole but I had bubble bags
there and I had friends there and Marcel
[SPEAKER_08]: brought the fish two thousand bubbler
there which was like at the time a ten
[SPEAKER_08]: thousand dollar pipe that he like
literally said he lit and he passed and
[SPEAKER_08]: then he didn't see it for hours and he
would just catch glimpses of it moving
[SPEAKER_08]: around the place and then at the end of
the day at night it kind of came back to
[SPEAKER_08]: him.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that cross-eyed and painless that they
did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God man that cross-eyed and painless
from Seminole Indian Reservation Big
[SPEAKER_08]: Cypress was pretty much my favorite
version of that song.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just incredible to witness the sun
the sun coming up that day Marcus was just
[SPEAKER_16]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was like velvet sea was right at
sunrise and you know you're just there and
[SPEAKER_16]: you're spent but you're in this new
millennium.
[SPEAKER_16]: And remember everyone thought like
computers were going to take over the
[SPEAKER_16]: world or computers were going to crash or
something.
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's actually a famous YouTube clip
up on YouTube that shows like Peter
[SPEAKER_16]: Jennings who was I guess hosting ABC's
Rockin' the Millennium New Year's and they
[SPEAKER_16]: actually cut to fish and they do heavy
things.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah it just it was really surreal to
be there.
[SPEAKER_16]: But the reason why I was mentioning that
is it seemed like that was kind of like a
[SPEAKER_16]: crescendo that was hit.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then after that it was just like like
what do we do like what can we do that
[SPEAKER_16]: would possibly top that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they did like there's always after he
wrote sketches of Spain you know like
[SPEAKER_11]: musically it was like the pinnacle for him
like he was like where do I go from here.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then he came back and ripped bitches
brew at 42 years old and changed again
[SPEAKER_11]: changed music changed the world in which
we perceive you know being the Grateful
[SPEAKER_13]: Dead and playing a hundred thousand person
event in 1973 at Watkins Glen in New
[SPEAKER_13]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like after 1973 you'd think oh shit how
are we going to go bigger than that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Next thing you know you make the Wallace
Sound which is eighty nine thousand watt
[SPEAKER_13]: you know system with every single string
on its own channel and Owsley just coming
[SPEAKER_13]: out of jail to create the largest sound
system that's ever been known to mankind.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm pretty sure humans are you know
capable of creating the new best thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know I'm just thankful for that
creativity.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would also add to the psychedelic lore
that barter fairs were really important
[SPEAKER_13]: back in the day too.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think to that year 1974 which I call
buttery buttery soft Grateful Dead is like
[SPEAKER_16]: 74 to 76.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was that they sounded so great.
[SPEAKER_16]: They were so on their game.
[SPEAKER_16]: Really you think we could create that
again now.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean even when you listen to all of the
music back then Steely Dan all the Motown
[SPEAKER_16]: all the R&B stuff that was happening in
the 70s to the 70s we'll never be able to
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think music will ever be like that
again ever again.
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll be different.
[SPEAKER_12]: George Clinton in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_16]: It seemed to just get distorted to the
point where now somebody you know doesn't
[SPEAKER_16]: do a studio release or a record they do
some recording on tick tock.
[SPEAKER_16]: And next thing you know they're the next
you know international sensation.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean I think what we witnessed in like
the 70s and the 80s I mean that groovy
[SPEAKER_16]: music when you go back and listen to that
I mean all that great good Steely Dan and
[SPEAKER_16]: all that great stuff even like through the
80s with like bands like Los Lobos.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean we'll never see that level of
creativity and really goodness and music
[SPEAKER_16]: again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well that's what they said about Sabbath
and Zeppelin and the Beatles and the
[SPEAKER_08]: Stones and all these incredible bands.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the bottom line is is we will.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a guarantee.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to be like musically blown
away like truly like not not so much the
[SPEAKER_08]: music but lyrics like I've been tripping
on this guy Harry Mack lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even say enough about him.
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy does live freestyles.
[SPEAKER_08]: He writes entire songs from the top of his
head in an instant with three words that
[SPEAKER_08]: given to get given to him and he's doing
it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's doing it on Omegle.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very very different from what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it goes to show that there are things
that have never existed that are just
[SPEAKER_08]: starting to exist.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if that can exist then something else
can exist you know in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm I have faith that human beings are
only going to get tastier and better.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean when I saw this young rock band
that came out I'm probably going to forget
[SPEAKER_08]: their name but they sounded so much like
Zeppelin and Rush.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you heard these these young kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember you talking.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also like Kevin Parker from Tame
Impala.
[SPEAKER_11]: That kid's a killer songwriter.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean you know it's newer but I mean he's
got a lot of creativity with his guitar
[SPEAKER_11]: pedals and he's a baller.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean he he knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know I agree I think music in
different ways is going to reshape the
[SPEAKER_11]: future.
[SPEAKER_11]: And look that you know we were talking
about the wall of sound.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean think about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if many people realize this
like the reason we have noise canceling
[SPEAKER_11]: microphones is literally because of the
wall of sound.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we like in terms of live music the
wall of sound was the beginning of where
[SPEAKER_11]: we're at.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like that was live.
[SPEAKER_11]: They the they were the first band to
really think about the live experience in
[SPEAKER_11]: terms of why don't what do I experience in
the studio is not being experienced to the
[SPEAKER_11]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how do we translate that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the wall of sound really took those
ideologies and they they use their brains
[SPEAKER_11]: and their their passion to get get us
where we're at today with festivals.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean before we had any of this stuff we
had just terrible sound.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't I don't you know we don't
realize that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Colin that was due to Owsley.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it but it was working with the band.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like and then working with McIntosh in
upstate New York to actually design the
[SPEAKER_11]: drivers to amplify everything correctly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_13]: The entire creation of selling the whole
entire population LSD on top of it all
[SPEAKER_13]: really helps.
Seriously.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well and a steal your face logo as well as
the buckles because the first thing he
[SPEAKER_07]: tried to do was sell me a buckle when I
made it and he's like hey you want to
[SPEAKER_07]: buckle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know there's still musical
geniuses out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean go check out this piano player
Harami.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean she is absolutely amazing as you
know there's prodigies and those amazing
[SPEAKER_07]: you know jazz players that are still
rising with each generation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know it's also about staying
plugged in and looking and listening
[SPEAKER_07]: because I think what is it the average
person stops listening to new music at the
[SPEAKER_07]: age of 32.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know you have to always be reaching
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it sounds weird but that's if you
go look at psychology a lot of people cut
[SPEAKER_07]: off their music around 32 33 and
everything below that for their
[SPEAKER_07]: generations they listen to.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just you know it's also about
plugging in and checking in because
[SPEAKER_07]: there's still amazing musicianship out
there that will raise the level.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're starting to see rock music just
starting to make it back.
[SPEAKER_07]: So step by step.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was Greta Greta van Fleet was the
band.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah Greta and they're dude those kids
rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean and while we're on the topic of
jazz we lost an absolute visionary this
[SPEAKER_11]: past week Chick Corea.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean you want to talk about an
innovator.
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy was the first person to take an
electric piano with Herbie Hancock and
[SPEAKER_11]: really incorporate that into jazz.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean that's that's a sounds like a small
feat but that's literally like Dylan
[SPEAKER_11]: plugging his guitar in for the first time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know Romy Romy did a jam with actual
Chick Corea.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Chick is a major inspiration to me and we
lost a legend.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean what would be like that again.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know like that that's what I'm kind of
like if you look at the change in popular
[SPEAKER_16]: music that happened in the three decades
between the 1930s and the 1960s and then
[SPEAKER_16]: you look at like the three decades like
that have unfolded since today.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's hardly any change right.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll agree with what ATN said is that
there are incredibly talented musicians
[SPEAKER_16]: out there.
[SPEAKER_16]: One of my current favorites right now is
none other than William Apostol aka Billy
[SPEAKER_16]: Strings.
[SPEAKER_16]: Billy Strings is just you know Doc Watson
reincarnated Doc Watson and Clarence White
[SPEAKER_16]: reincarnated.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you don't know who those people are
look them up again.
[SPEAKER_16]: He is a true bluegrass player through and
through but can shred anything and he's
[SPEAKER_16]: just an incredible talent.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's Bill Monroe bluegrass which you
know was invented back in the 30s and 40s.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm just wondering like what's next.
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the next big thing that's going to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well they're talking about Zappa in the
chat room.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know there's Zappa's long gone yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I seen Dweezil Zappa play Zappa Zappa play
Zappa a few years ago and that shit tore
[SPEAKER_08]: my head off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I sat in the front row.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely flabbergasted at the quality of
his ability to play the guitar but also
[SPEAKER_08]: the ability to pull people from Frank's
groups into his group.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just everything was so so on point
that I have an appreciation for that as
[SPEAKER_08]: well.
[SPEAKER_16]: Frank Zappa maybe that's out there right
now Marcus.
[SPEAKER_16]: Which one does Zappa movie that's out
there.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a documentary on Frank Zappa.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a few.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it like a new one.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you say the same.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah I've seen that too Mark.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also Rupert Neve passed away.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean Rupert Neve is responsible for
pretty much every record in existence
[SPEAKER_11]: that's been recorded if they were in any
major studio.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's you know the Neve console was a
mixing board that had very specific
[SPEAKER_11]: components that allowed a very dynamic
richness to be captured from through
[SPEAKER_11]: microphones and you know that was that he
was a major contributor behind the curtain
[SPEAKER_11]: to a lot of our our favorite records that
we all listen to.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah the first wall of sound was actually
put together in studios by Phil Spector.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no way.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Phil Spector who just recently died.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: In prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: In prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all his cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: He sort of went lowly to the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean right before he murdered his wife
his wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people did he actually murder
them because he only got caught for one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about a shout out to Stevie Ray Vaughn
if we're going to talk about genius
[SPEAKER_08]: musicians.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to catch him.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw him.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw him jam together on the riverboat
president.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the same guitar.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a one was a short neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other was a long neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they ripped that shit apart man.
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole place was just jaw dropped
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to say a lot a lot of it is
access and access to to media and access
[SPEAKER_15]: to create media.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's totally changed from from the era of
the 70s and the 80s and even the 90s where
[SPEAKER_15]: every iPhone and iPad you get has a sound
engineer system in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know garage band.
[SPEAKER_15]: We could all create fucking epic music
right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we can also put it out really
easy with a couple clicks.
[SPEAKER_15]: I could put it on iTunes and it's
available.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that has like spread out the interest
and who's listening to what.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I think a lot more people are
listening to a lot more diverse music.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a lot of people kicking ass
right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a lot of influences that are
being melded.
[SPEAKER_15]: And man I just you know that's just kind
of what I was thinking when I was here and
[SPEAKER_15]: all that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I listen to all the great stuff
too.
[SPEAKER_15]: In high school I was listening to the 70s
bands and fucking rocking out and thinking
[SPEAKER_15]: man that was the era of music.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know people were really melding sound
and the guitars were ripping.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what we kind of modeled our
music after.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then it changed you know because we
had influence from the stuff of our time
[SPEAKER_15]: you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: And music has changed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah the stuff that's coming out right
now.
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of think is mimicking the 80s 80s
stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I kind of love it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know but it's muddled with hip hop and
beats that are different than we had in
[SPEAKER_15]: the 80s.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got people being exposed to music that
weren't being exposed to music.
[SPEAKER_08]: So YouTube has this entire culture of
reaction videos where you have people who
[SPEAKER_08]: have never heard of these bands getting
suggestions through their YouTube comments
[SPEAKER_08]: to go on and you know oh you got to hear
Texas Flood by Stevie Ray Rivan.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've never heard and seen that you
just won't believe it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been watching all sorts of these
reaction videos because it's just like
[SPEAKER_08]: really unique people from where they could
be from like the inner city of Chicago or
[SPEAKER_08]: Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're just like hey what's up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a I'm a YouTube reaction guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stevie Knight is one of the guys I watch
that I really like.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a big kind of muscle dude and he's
always.
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched Jamal Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is Kelly talking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to make sure I wasn't talking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah Jamal I watched Jamal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamal is amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's from South Central LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to tell you a story really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see Frank Zappa in Chicago in
1988 and we were out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was like a in the middle of
summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a Bears show and I had traded a
bag of weed to this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said hey I'll give you a ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go see this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's after hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't start till midnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know the guy's name is Frank
Zappa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like I don't even know who that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really didn't even know who Frank Zappa
was in 1988.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I didn't know who he was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went into this little underground bar
and they were handing everybody fans at
[SPEAKER_01]: the at the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like some of them were really beautiful
fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them were paper fans and they were
handing out fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we went in Frank Zappa came
out onto the stage and he said all my fans
[SPEAKER_01]: I love all my fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all my beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he continued to rock the house
down for a 50 person show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really think that Fish needs to have a
permanent picture of Frank Zappa on their
[SPEAKER_13]: stage on every single show that they play
because without Frank Zappa you know Fish
[SPEAKER_13]: is unique.
[SPEAKER_13]: But wow they always prop out Frank.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean Peaches on Regalia that's their ode
to Frank and they crush it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I suspect if Frank ever saw them play that
he would be like he'd be impressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Sam weren't you Frank's neighbor at
one point Sam?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah for several years in Laurel Canyon.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I dated Dweezil's babysitter Christina
from Hot Rats in the swimming pool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Frank was the only one allowed to even jam
with like Pink Floyd.
[SPEAKER_07]: They wouldn't jam with anybody but they
would let Frank come up and jam.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well I've also heard Frank play cover
songs of like Jimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton
[SPEAKER_14]: and Frank can just run circles around.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean Frank was a genius guitar player
without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been to about maybe 50 of Frank's
concerts and about maybe a similar number
[SPEAKER_14]: of him just practicing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a true composer.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a true composer's composer.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was a musical genius.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what it's hard to mention Frank
without mentioning Sun Ra who was another
[SPEAKER_08]: musical composer and if you don't know who
Sun Ra is I really you know Space is the
[SPEAKER_08]: Place is his autobiography which is
absolutely spectacular and he has quite a
[SPEAKER_08]: few stories about Frank in that book.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah Sun Ra, Space is the Place.
[SPEAKER_14]: So is that sort of psychedelic punk?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Big Steve Parrish who for many years was
Jerry Garcia's roadie has got a show on XM
[SPEAKER_16]: called Big Steve Hour and just last week
he was recalling a caller called in and
[SPEAKER_16]: asked why The Dead never played with Zappa
and Big Steve basically said the reason
[SPEAKER_16]: why Zappa didn't like The Grateful Dead is
because Zappa hated cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah he hated a lot of drugs.
[SPEAKER_16]: He hated cannabis having to deal with
music and rock and roll and the fact that
[SPEAKER_16]: all rock and roll musicians were kind of
categorized as stoners.
[SPEAKER_16]: He said the reason why he didn't come
around us because he couldn't deal with
[SPEAKER_16]: the level of cannabis use and when they
did come together he was a total not
[SPEAKER_16]: social you know kind of asshole.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well he did like two drugs.
[SPEAKER_14]: He liked nicotine and caffeine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and sex.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah but he hated cannabis and his
cannabis use is well or his hatred for
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis use is well documented.
[SPEAKER_08]: It talked about in Space is the Place as
well they talk about it in the
[SPEAKER_08]: autobiography that because people who
played with Sun Ra also played with Frank
[SPEAKER_08]: and they had strict rules to not hang out
with not just The Grateful Dead but a huge
[SPEAKER_08]: amount of people and groups and musicians
that were doing all sorts of drugs because
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah Frank it altered his you know he was
an OCD genius that wanted everyone to be
[SPEAKER_08]: doing kind of you know composing what they
wanted and they were tripping balls on
[SPEAKER_08]: acid.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't coming together for him I guess.
[SPEAKER_11]: Zappa reminds me of like a more accessible
John McLaughlin.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always kind of associated their work
very similar but he was just more
[SPEAKER_11]: accessible and was more together in terms
of the way he put music out.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just going to add the only thing
about the movie that I found a little
[SPEAKER_16]: disappointing was you know there were so
many players in and out of the Mothers
[SPEAKER_16]: especially in the earlier years that were
fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_16]: Lowell George got kicked out of the
Mothers because of his drug use.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean he's went on and made Little Feet.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know there's just the list is endless
of musicians that were around Frank Zappa.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't forget Jimmy Carl Black.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the Indian of the group.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how about a shout out for Bill
Laswell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out for Bill Laswell.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got I mean he's been involved in
thousands of recordings.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you mentioned John McLaughlin I
immediately clicked to Bill Laswell and
[SPEAKER_08]: he's got some.
[SPEAKER_11]: John Zorn a lot of those guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh Zorn.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah the downtown you know Zorn not
mentioned the stone in New York.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean you know there's a huge you know I
was involved in the downtown scene a bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I you know this guy like I think Bill
lives in San Francisco now.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's still doing shows.
[SPEAKER_11]: Much smaller settings.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah an incredible player and someone
that's inspired myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that he's really moved music
forward in terms of what you're saying
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark through the 90s.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he held the torch in terms of
experimental stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who takes a Miles Davis album.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or who takes a Bob Marley album.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to fuck with this and see
what I can pull off of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that that I can't remember the title.
[SPEAKER_11]: Panthalassa is the Miles one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Panthalassa is so good dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Incredible albums and really deep you know
very psychedelic in a lot of senses.
[SPEAKER_11]: I highly recommend Panthalassa then.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dreams of Freedom ambient translations of
Bob Marley and Dub.
[SPEAKER_08]: Robbie Shankar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I was saying Robbie Shankar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one that was not OK with cannabis
smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't OK with drugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: And was influencing the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he decided that he was going to just
open himself up to it because there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also he had a healer who he had been
working with his whole life ever since he
[SPEAKER_01]: was a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the healer had told him you know I do
think that you need to open up your music
[SPEAKER_01]: you know for him and open up your arms to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that because he did that it
really made his music so much better so
[SPEAKER_01]: much more rich.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well and he gave he gave us he gave music
an incredible gift right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nora Jones is his daughter and she's
incredible.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you've ever seen her.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah she is just she's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about we shout out Usta Alhaka Hussain
if we're going to shout out Robbie Shankar
[SPEAKER_08]: and his son Zakir Hussain who is probably
one of the greatest players of the tabla
[SPEAKER_08]: to ever walk the face of the earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: That man brought me to tears at several
concerts that I've recorded of.
[SPEAKER_16]: I saw him with the Grateful Dead back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their music really changed for the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that it became so much more
worldly and so much more palatable when
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis became sort of part of you know
the tuning of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he even talks about it sort of
intimately in an interview of how against
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs he is and how he does feel like
playing with other people under the
[SPEAKER_01]: influence did help his music did help him
actually he says reach Shiva in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was open like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would just add an opposite end of the
spectrum and just give a lot of love to
[SPEAKER_13]: George Clinton and the people who are
really funk all stars and funkadelic and
[SPEAKER_13]: their whole influence on the culture and
spoken word.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bootsy Bootsy Bootsy came from that
traditional James Brown style and then
[SPEAKER_13]: just blew the top off with George Clinton.
[SPEAKER_13]: So like by the time we saw George Clinton
in the mid early 90s I mean that was five
[SPEAKER_13]: to six hours straight.
[SPEAKER_13]: No breaks total church.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know just rhythm down to the core.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it weren't for LSD it would be
really hard to go to one of those shows.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember seeing him come out on stage
with a cape that just said inhale on it
[SPEAKER_11]: just like arms wide open.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so rad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome Debbie.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's it going.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw you on Clubhouse the other day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like Debbie's on Clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi Debbie.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey Colin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was on there this morning talking about
a heavy topic.
[SPEAKER_10]: Should white women be considered equity
under these cannabis regulations.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_10]: Equality.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're working for equality but equity is a
different thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So oh man that's a fun way to wake up your
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw you in that room and I was like damn
that's that's going to be some heavy
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was it was fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fun though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well welcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been talking about music all day.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've talked about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah we started out talking about ketamine
and psychedelics as we have the Ames
[SPEAKER_08]: Institute Dr. Allison and A.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: Braddock and some other women did some
journeys there yesterday and I guess
[SPEAKER_08]: they're going to go again today.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they started us out talking about every
drug but cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that kind of led us into all of
these amazing sort of musicians.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've it's been an interesting like
I'll say like once again you know even
[SPEAKER_08]: when we're just shooting the shit like if
you want to learn about some great
[SPEAKER_08]: musicians and bands the last 45 minute
conversation in here dropped like I want
[SPEAKER_08]: to say 50 plus musicians and I'm guessing
not everyone knew the names of each person
[SPEAKER_08]: that we dropped.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah just talking about all these great
musicians and the sort of effects that
[SPEAKER_08]: psychedelics and cannabis has had on these
musicians.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my contribution.
[SPEAKER_10]: I ate an edible a couple of weeks ago and
I made a seven hour Spotify playlist.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you know you can go get that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll check that out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Send that to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Send that to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put it up in the comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking the dead Debbie.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I bet you there is there's one or two
songs on there because as we know how
[SPEAKER_07]: beneficial or influential the the lots
were to you know can and to getting the
[SPEAKER_07]: message out on canvas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I put one eleven minute long Grateful Dead
song on there and then I realized well I
[SPEAKER_10]: can't do that again because that's when
people turn off the playlist.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's when some people turn on the
playlist.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Star that dark star is too short.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like alligator.
[SPEAKER_10]: I put alligator on there because that's
the ultimate LSD recording.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know like that's the one where they
were just so high on every drug possible.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like let us in the studio.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know I love that one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Viola Lee blues from back in the day to a
good old Viola Lee blues where they hit
[SPEAKER_13]: that drop at the end and they just get
right back in the room.
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys listen to the XM channel the
Grateful Dead channel on XM they have
[SPEAKER_16]: today in Grateful Dead history.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well the last couple of days they've been
playing the shows from the Fillmore East
[SPEAKER_16]: February 11th 12th 13 14th New York City
1970.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've had these on cassette tapes since
I was probably a sophomore in high school.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going back to nineteen seventy I
don't know eight ish.
[SPEAKER_16]: So oh my God to hear those in such great
sound quality is just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the almonds came out during I think it
was Love Light or something like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can hear Greg Allman singing
because Greg Allman takes the mic and you
[SPEAKER_16]: can totally make out Dwayne 's playing
because Dwayne just sounds different than
[SPEAKER_16]: Garcia.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just not Garcia at all.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean I've been listening to this piece
of music.
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that where the almonds really got
influenced by the dead to really go into
[SPEAKER_13]: the German shred.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah I feel like that was the show.
[SPEAKER_16]: They always had they had the two drummer
thing going on too.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think both of those bands mutually
influenced each other.
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you think about that as such a
magical period for the dead because they
[SPEAKER_16]: were just about to go into the studio and
record a work in Man's Dead.
[SPEAKER_16]: Then you know later on in the year they
get busted in New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so now they got to you know quickly
put American beauty together.
[SPEAKER_16]: So those two albums came out in 1970.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know and I was only eight years old
when they came out.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I was on tour you know a handful of
years later and it was just oh my God.
[SPEAKER_16]: So so magical.
[SPEAKER_16]: They were so great.
[SPEAKER_13]: You Vanita Oregon Country Fair show where
they did a Springfield Creamery benefit
[SPEAKER_13]: which was Ken Kesey's brother has a
Springfield Creamery which is Nancy's
[SPEAKER_13]: yogurt which is the first yogurt in
America to have probiotics.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks Ken Kesey for and family for
introducing probiotics to us in our
[SPEAKER_13]: yogurt.
[SPEAKER_13]: Back in the early 70s and then to have
20,000 people show up at the Oregon
[SPEAKER_13]: Country Fair a lot 1972 minimal cars in
the parking lot because most people came
[SPEAKER_13]: in and school buses are hitchhiked and it
was like 110 degrees out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that was during the gas lines too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nobody wanted to wait in the gas line.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all hitchhiking out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway Sunshine Daydream is the name of
the show.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah the movie.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah that movie.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that movie is either on Amazon or
something.
[SPEAKER_16]: You could watch it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there's clips of it on I know the
Birdsong is up on is up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_16]: And again yeah that really weird you know
naked completely stark naked hippie that's
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of like behind Jerry right.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the camera every once in a while you
get Jerry and you get this naked hippie
[SPEAKER_16]: who's kind of like doing that sitting up
on a pole.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: What an incredible.
[SPEAKER_16]: Again had those tapes for years.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of my most played cassette tapes that
I have in my collection are the those
[SPEAKER_16]: Vanita shows.
[SPEAKER_10]: Randomly put on my my dancing bear scarf.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you guys can see this but
I just apparently came right in at the
[SPEAKER_10]: right time.
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way I remember all those farm kids
that came and helped us a cannabis action
[SPEAKER_10]: network like the second generation kids
from the farm in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah we actually went to the farm in
Tennessee and they made us fresh mushrooms
[SPEAKER_07]: and fresh tofu and yeah they're great
amazing people man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steven Ina May Gaskin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah Steven Gaskin actually married me at
my original wedding at the high times
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Steven and I know also midwifery cool
because of our midwifery connection and
[SPEAKER_13]: anyone who doesn't have the books
spiritual midwifery that is a must have
[SPEAKER_13]: book whether you're having a baby or not
there is a beautiful stories in there of
[SPEAKER_13]: people that took their power back and had
home births.
[SPEAKER_13]: They created a whole line of buses and
school buses that went around the country
[SPEAKER_13]: and then they finally settled in Tennessee
and created a thing called the farm and
[SPEAKER_13]: the farm still functions to this day as a
let's say a women and children's health
[SPEAKER_01]: clinic along with educational outreach for
midwives.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not talking about the seven tribes
buses are we crazy brown and white buses.
[SPEAKER_13]: Extremely different.
[SPEAKER_13]: The 12 tribes is the group that got the
people that were too high.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was Joshua.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they they've comforted them with
Jesus and and Christianity and food.
Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: The family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say I pulled I pulled my
girlfriends off of those buses all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first modus operandi was if anybody was
missing I would go and see Joshua in the
[SPEAKER_01]: buses and be like all right someone's
missing and they're they would be drinking
[SPEAKER_01]: chai in the back telling me they were
having the best experience of their life
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were going to go home to Oklahoma
with them.
[SPEAKER_13]: So also you know the tribe also is a very
amazing group of self-sufficient people
[SPEAKER_13]: that creates really good food at festivals
like common ground which is now more of
[SPEAKER_01]: the common.
[SPEAKER_13]: There is even 12 tribes up here in British
Columbia and they have places that are
[SPEAKER_13]: really powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know it's it's definitely a cold a
lot of the mustard seed cafes and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: are still run by them but they're not
they're not so scary.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're like earth loving Christian
anarchists.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the common grounders that moved
into Winnipeg and they were definitely
[SPEAKER_08]: very much the same people that had those
buses on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_08]: They like come and eat our bakeries goods
and you couldn't have to stay away from
[SPEAKER_16]: those.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_16]: You definitely want to stay away.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I wanted to see the people that
they that they that they were able to
attract.
[SPEAKER_11]: Same Mark.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd go and I'd check them out but yeah I
was told the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiddle music in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so endearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spinners.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder how many of those people still
are around with their little followings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I would I haven't seen spinners
in a long time but that's definitely where
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hang out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll say this much they couldn't keep up
the fish tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a five and a half hour spin once and
that was pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I entered a new realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk a lot about you know drugs and and
and meditation and things that get get you
[SPEAKER_01]: into other realms and into you know other
lines of thinking and spinning is
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievably incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know the whole Sufi religion is is
sparked off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyone who hasn't anyone who hasn't
taken a moment to spin in a really big
[SPEAKER_01]: open field and spin past where you're
scared spin past where you're dizzy and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's this incredible calm in the center
and you know people spin to find that
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible calm and they say that it's a
place where you can clearly speak to God
[SPEAKER_01]: and it really is like a true place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that balance so many times
that at dead shows and I never even knew
[SPEAKER_01]: these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never even spoke to these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just go and spin for four hours
next to them and feel this vibration and
[SPEAKER_01]: and and find maybe some questions that I
was looking for in the week or you know in
[SPEAKER_13]: my life between sets at Oakland there is
the spinners percussion players.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just beyond the confines of Shakedown
Street usually toward the end they had the
[SPEAKER_16]: disco bus.
[SPEAKER_16]: You remember the disco bus.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so the disco bus would put these
really big speakers on top of the bus and
[SPEAKER_16]: just blare the loudest disco music and
just attract this crowd of really spun out
[SPEAKER_16]: people all around just grooving disco.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was great man.
[SPEAKER_13]: So fun out is when you don't find the
center of the spin when you find the
[SPEAKER_13]: center of the spin you have fun out.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's interesting you know how
these are you know extremely you know
[SPEAKER_13]: they're Muslim you know and I think they
also smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very open to cannabis use in the Sufi
religion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So connection and and the disco bus for
sure because it always made you say yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: after the show OK I'll have another hit
and you know the disco bus was going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: on for another four more hours and you
were safe and taking it out of your bags.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were found at the disco bus.
[SPEAKER_16]: And eventually the nitrous mob would find
would find the disco bus.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so then the people would start buying
balloons which would feed the disco bus.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you'd have all these things all sucking
on nitrous all dancing disco.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder how different the scene would
have been if the full melt bubble could
[SPEAKER_08]: have been there on the early Grateful Dead
days.
[SPEAKER_08]: They never had it.
[SPEAKER_13]: There was there was there was bubble and
Keith at Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just wasn't popularized in the same way
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: There were heady insane hash oil makers in
Eugene at the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: So just not hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: You never saw a full melt hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have seen hash oil but you
weren't seeing full melt hash at those
[SPEAKER_08]: shows.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you dry sift.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those dry sifts melt.
[SPEAKER_12]: They do.
[SPEAKER_08]: They absolutely melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just aren't full melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: They melted what they thought was the
meltiest of the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were probably 50 percent heads but
there was just there was beautiful origins
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll say yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The old.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was still an import business at that
point with the hashes coming through.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean none of it seemed very good but
you can still get the kind of brown and
[SPEAKER_10]: black hashes that came in in bricks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally totally.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the more likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that that would definitely
bubble up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anybody that tours you would
buy it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would just measure it out not have a
scale because having a scale at that time
[SPEAKER_01]: either was difficult or it was always the
triple beam and you didn't really want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a scale on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had the long coils and then they
would just measure it out to like a half
[SPEAKER_01]: inch or an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what the weight of it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you lit that up right at first it
definitely had a sweet bubble to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really quite no no not even
close to full melt but it would bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: just for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember talking about how cool that
was.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know I just remember being at the
whole enchilada country fair like really
[SPEAKER_13]: early 90s and some crazy amazing hippie
coming out and pretty much knocking us
[SPEAKER_13]: over with Keith.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know like we were just like what the
hell is this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was just it was really special.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know it was unicorn tears back then.
[SPEAKER_13]: Country Country Fair was the collection of
the most heady people.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you know you were going to find you
were going to find the best the best
[SPEAKER_13]: either there or at the Southern Oregon
Barter Fair.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the two.
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot about the days when we were all
experts at eyeballing the weight of
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis just by looking at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The art of eyeballing the gram an eighth
and quarter an ounce.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many fingers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Taking it back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Time for a dab everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do this up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got some cookies and cream going down in
my bowl right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: All this talk of hash got me excited.
[SPEAKER_10]: Me and Etienne spun off from Dead Tour on
to the other tours.
[SPEAKER_10]: We did Vans Further.
[SPEAKER_10]: We did Lollapalooza Hoard.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fishbone took us out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Primus took us out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Primus took us out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_16]: Were you guys at the festival.
[SPEAKER_16]: Was it the last outside lands where they
actually allowed cannabis sales on site at
[SPEAKER_16]: the festival.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Greenlands or something like that it
was called.
[SPEAKER_10]: I missed it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Susan's doing that I think.
[SPEAKER_16]: Susan Soares.
[SPEAKER_16]: Was that a success or did the people who
put that together.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean are they going to.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there going to be more things like
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know I think they'll definitely be
more things like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as you know they would have had
one this time I think it would have
[SPEAKER_10]: happened again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Susan was also doing it at.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh what's the big festival down in
Southern California in February.
[SPEAKER_10]: Coachella.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coachella.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coachella.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they're going to do that there as
well.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they're going to have stupid
things where you have to buy your cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: over here and you have to smoke it over
here.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not going to be able to mingle in
the rest of the crowd.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean is it going to be like really
restrictive on where you can use it you
[SPEAKER_16]: know.
[SPEAKER_16]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know people are trying to get kiosks at
like Shoreline and other places so that
[SPEAKER_07]: whenever there are shows they can actually
show up and actually have a cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: kiosk.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've only heard the discussions of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've not actually seen it in real practice
because that was all getting ready to kick
[SPEAKER_07]: off pre-COVID.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah my fear is the same as you Mark
is that you wouldn't be able to bring in
[SPEAKER_07]: your own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would have to buy this expensive ass
you know whatever weed we decide you have
[SPEAKER_07]: to buy and to consume it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's a.
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to consume it in the beer garden
area that they're telling you to consume
[SPEAKER_16]: it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not like you can buy it and take it
back to your seat which is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is even worse with cannabis because
they want to put up a wall because like
[SPEAKER_15]: somehow it's okay to see someone drinking
something because you know that could be
[SPEAKER_15]: water it could be juice it could be
alcohol but smoking like in Washington
[SPEAKER_15]: they've done a few events and then they
can put up an eight wall eight foot wall
[SPEAKER_15]: in the park.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have a band over here and then you
have the sectioned off eight foot wall
[SPEAKER_15]: where everyone's smoking weed and they
can't see the band.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there's two people in front of
the band like.
[SPEAKER_07]: CC here at the Emerald Cup in California
they have the alcohol people penned up in
[SPEAKER_07]: their pens and you can smoke cannabis
anywhere pretty much.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it should be and that's how
hopefully it will become.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah this separation of church and
state yeah alcohol they need to be penned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis they should be allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed agreed here here.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that Sam?
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the biggest music event that folks
have been to?
[SPEAKER_14]: With me it was four hundred thousand
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have to say my biggest event was
certainly not a music event it was the
[SPEAKER_08]: Maha Kumbh Mela and I think there was like
two point eight million people there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you meet most of them?
[SPEAKER_08]: I met like a good chunk of them you know
all the ones with good hash anyway the
[SPEAKER_08]: ones that I needed to meet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there a porta potty in sight?
[SPEAKER_08]: No you're just shitting the Ganges dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was in the north it was quite clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone thinks the Ganges are so
disgusting and dirty because of Varanasi
[SPEAKER_08]: where they burn the bodies.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is up north in Haridwar near
Rishikesh.
[SPEAKER_14]: No the water's quite nice up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was people were like oh my god you went
in the Ganges.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like yeah dude it was like looked like
North Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was just like water coming out of
foothills of the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was it was it was really
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to kind of.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: I swam in the Ganges in Banaras and I saw
pieces of body burnt by.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah like a hand.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was actually less than a hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh it happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of wanted to change the subject a
little bit because recently what I did was
[SPEAKER_08]: I went on a three-day tour here in the
interior in the Okanagan.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to Penticton and I went to Vernon
and I went to Kelowna.
[SPEAKER_08]: I cruised around to some other little
smaller spots like Oliver and I went and
[SPEAKER_08]: visited all these different people with
shops.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of wanted to get your guys's
opinion on this because you know these
[SPEAKER_08]: people have some of them are legacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way both sides have like spent an
enormous amount of time and energy to get
[SPEAKER_08]: to where they are by now first being
potentially civil disobedient but now kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of saying OK we're going to follow the
rules.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get in line.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to jump through these burning
hoops.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they've got their shops.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course you know all their shops are
there's some difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely didn't come to the coots.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have been at your place.
[SPEAKER_08]: You kidding me.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Josh and Kelly texting me
privately better not have come to the
[SPEAKER_08]: coots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be talking to you for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know to get this out basically you
know there's you can kind of create
[SPEAKER_08]: different vibes in your shops but every
single package looks exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you know it's this Canada
packaging thing that really kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: affects you know your ability to stand
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will give it up to the cottage.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe in Penticton.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was so cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go on my Instagram you might still
be able to see the shots.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a little cottage and then you walk
in and it looked like the foyer of a
[SPEAKER_08]: little old lady's home with these
beautiful couches and plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was plants growing down the
walls and then you walked into this great
[SPEAKER_08]: room that was all hardwood floors and all
wooden kind of walls and beautiful
[SPEAKER_08]: wallpaper like what's behind Josh and
Kelly.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know really cool all around the place.
[SPEAKER_08]: It set a vibe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt like I was visiting my plug who
stayed at his grandma's house the night
[SPEAKER_08]: before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you walk in and there's just a
guy standing there behind a couple of
[SPEAKER_08]: counters and he was super nice and super
cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you've got all these people working
really hard trying to get this done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you have this other element.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the indigenous people who are
like well we want to play too.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got our sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to play.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should be allowed to play.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wish I remembered her name Selena who
is in Vernon had told me the story of a
[SPEAKER_08]: good friend of hers who is a native woman
and was trying to go the route of the
[SPEAKER_08]: legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just like one obstacle wall
after another.
[SPEAKER_08]: And finally she was like you know what I'm
going to throw a sea can down right on
[SPEAKER_08]: native property and we're just going to
start selling weed like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think she even created something called
the Green Mile where there's like a bunch
[SPEAKER_08]: of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: All kind of together.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you drive through the Okanagan
they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are literally everywhere and they
don't have limits.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can sell as much as they want.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can advertise so they have signs all
over the highways and on posts and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And let me tell you it was a point of
contention with a lot of the shop owners.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the rep that I was with was
extremely surprised when I said what I
[SPEAKER_08]: said.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think you guys might have an idea
what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said they were like well it's not fair.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not fair there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know they don't have to follow the
rules.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like really it's not fair.
[SPEAKER_08]: So but what about when you stole their
children and murdered their ancestors.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about when our ancestors did that.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That also was not fair.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well I thought the rep was going to have a
heart attack when I said that to the first
[SPEAKER_08]: store owner in I think it was in
Penticton.
[SPEAKER_08]: I found the conversation to be
enlightening.
[SPEAKER_08]: I told them that they need to get behind
the indigenous population and the natives
[SPEAKER_08]: and they need to support them in every way
that they can.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do not want to stand against these
people on this issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis is actually making something a
little bit right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somehow cannabis is making things right
for the native populous right population
[SPEAKER_08]: right now in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just thought holy fuck this is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also convinced each and every one of
those stores that I had this discussion
[SPEAKER_08]: with that it will help you believe it or
not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the government's going to see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to realize there's no
competing with these no limits and edible
[SPEAKER_08]: no limits and go in and buy a quarter
pound if you want and advertise on the
[SPEAKER_08]: street.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really am a firm believer that
that's going to leach over into the legal
[SPEAKER_08]: federal program that we have now because
there's no getting away from it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This loophole is so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: The government is absolutely fucked on
this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's also the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Materials are not analyzed for safety.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say some probably are and some
probably aren't.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to say but yet they
definitely don't have to follow all the
[SPEAKER_08]: same regulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact any of them it's their own thing
and the shops are busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are definitely buying at those
shops and you know finding loyalty there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that not standing it standing
against them is one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_08]: mistakes you could make as a cannabis shop
owner right now in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say we have we have such an
incredible opportunity right now to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to work with the indigenous nations
in Canada to be able to get radical
[SPEAKER_01]: education in there because they have sort
of a wide open slate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're finding that these shop owners
and a lot of people the First Nations are
[SPEAKER_01]: so incredibly open to doing it right and
stepping in in a way that is really
[SPEAKER_01]: empowering the First Nations and also
empowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working with the ministry right
now we're putting together so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different SOPs different pilot projects
that's working directly with the First
[SPEAKER_01]: Nations peoples because this is a loophole
that cannabis can have a higher better
[SPEAKER_01]: voice and a higher effect on the federal
laws so that we can put things into place
[SPEAKER_01]: to say see look at how this can actually
be done better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be really silly for the LPs to
go against anything that's happening there
[SPEAKER_01]: because they also have the ability to go
through this direction to change the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis commerce is being done today
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really incredible opportunity
and thank you so much Marcus for both
[SPEAKER_01]: defending that and also bringing up this
because we've been living and breathing
[SPEAKER_01]: this in our home right now and working
with the ministry and writing down SOPs
[SPEAKER_01]: and really working hard to you know give
cannabis more of a medical stance which is
[SPEAKER_01]: where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of deep issues on that and I
would encourage people to look up what
[SPEAKER_13]: residential schools are in Canada and also
Indigenous women going missing and
[SPEAKER_13]: murdered in Canada is a really huge thing
and also in First Nations and tribes
[SPEAKER_13]: there's a lot of issues with addiction and
cannabis is helping that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a lot of tribes and nations
that are coming together to accept it to
[SPEAKER_13]: help them you know with their addictions
so we see it as a really positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also you know for any people who are
associated with LPs in order to have LPs
[SPEAKER_01]: there has to be a portion that you've been
you've made a commitment towards education
[SPEAKER_01]: you've made a commitment to the
communities that you're set up in and I
[SPEAKER_01]: really want to plead and encourage these
LPs to reach out to these Indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: nations to reach out to a lot of these
different shop owners and let's start
[SPEAKER_01]: swapping education let's use that federal
funding to make bridges for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really important and we still have
doors open to create more education for
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public as well as for the
First Nations as well as for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: addictions that Josh was just mentioning
that are just super incredibly high here
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_13]: Addictions and opioid deaths are killing
more people than COVID if I'm not you know
[SPEAKER_13]: oh yeah on that and yeah it's it's way
higher so it's like oh great we're all
[SPEAKER_13]: wearing masks but that does is not
stopping deaths but uh Johnny B looked
[SPEAKER_13]: like you had something to say and I'd be
interested to hear what you what you were
[SPEAKER_17]: thinking when it comes to medical and
you're talking about this and and and you
[SPEAKER_17]: can go into and to say Chilliwack and that
can go in and buy chocolate that's 10
[SPEAKER_17]: milligrams but I can go down the street to
the reserve and buy a bag of gummies
[SPEAKER_17]: that's 250 milligrams so I mean there's
quite a difference when it comes to
[SPEAKER_17]: medical so I mean if you're in need of
those type of edibles that's where you go
[SPEAKER_17]: because they actually have what you need
they actually have those high doses so I
[SPEAKER_17]: don't have to sit here and eat like 25 of
these I'm taking 250 milligram caps I go
[SPEAKER_17]: to the store here I can only buy 10
milligrams at a time so that's really
[SPEAKER_17]: disgusting and then if I if I buy more
than four items well that's over my 30
[SPEAKER_17]: grams so I actually have to leave and go
back in right so I mean you got to go home
[SPEAKER_08]: and then go back in because you can't have
all of that on you out in the world you'd
[SPEAKER_17]: have I'm medical so I can carry 150 grams
so right I can go in and out a few times
[SPEAKER_17]: because I am medical but once again so I'm
gonna have to walk out with a huge bay in
[SPEAKER_17]: order to get my so that's why I like
what's going on with with uh what's
[SPEAKER_17]: happening on the tribe stuff is they're
actually able to cater to those high doses
[SPEAKER_17]: edibles that are needed and and that's one
other thing that the government's really
[SPEAKER_17]: got to lighten up on because that's
another encouragement for people to go
[SPEAKER_17]: there and get proper dosaging for
themselves because you can't get that in
[SPEAKER_17]: the legal system in reality but that is a
legal system so let me rephrase that you
[SPEAKER_17]: can get this only in certain parts in the
system that are legal you know what also
[SPEAKER_08]: johnny that there's there's this real
limitations with the legal system for for
[SPEAKER_08]: lps and the limitation is that if we want
to supply a province they're going to
[SPEAKER_08]: require that we you know make some product
you know sell it to them and then if they
[SPEAKER_08]: sell that product and it's good and people
like it they want to be able to order it
[SPEAKER_08]: right away and if you don't have it
available to order right away you can fall
[SPEAKER_08]: to the bottom of the queue and so people
are desperate to make sure so right away
[SPEAKER_08]: that limits you massively now there's no
way that you can support a craft grower
[SPEAKER_08]: who's only growing small amounts because
what i'm going to buy 50 kilos from this
[SPEAKER_08]: guy and he's not going to have it again
for three more months like this might sell
[SPEAKER_08]: out in two days i might need to have a
reorder available in seven days it's
[SPEAKER_08]: another reason why we're limited to not
seeing 90 microns 73 micron how the hell
[SPEAKER_08]: am i going to produce 10 kilos of just 90
micron and then have another 10 kilos of
[SPEAKER_08]: it available in a month or a week or or
two months so what happens is all of that
[SPEAKER_08]: other small lot gets funneled into medical
the very place it shouldn't be because
[SPEAKER_08]: when medical people find something that
they like they love they need and you're
[SPEAKER_08]: never going to make it again oh sorry man
that was just a couple hundred grams you
[SPEAKER_08]: know we just got a certain amount of stuff
from so and so and we're probably not
[SPEAKER_08]: going to see that stuff anymore i think he
killed the clone you know like so they've
[SPEAKER_08]: got it set up to protect the recreational
market so you always have more and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: available or you drop the queue but they
they've left the most vulnerable people
[SPEAKER_08]: once again the very people who everyone
used as their shield for the last 10 plus
[SPEAKER_08]: years in canada so they could continue to
grow cannabis sell it and pay their
[SPEAKER_08]: mortgages while claiming it was for the
patient uh it's just bullshit i mean
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a lot of bullshit still there but
civil disobedience got us this far a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit more civil disobedience will
get us further sorry debbie did you have
[SPEAKER_10]: something oh i i didn't mean to interrupt
i'm so sorry but uh yeah on the topic of
[SPEAKER_10]: bullshit i wanted to tell you guys the bad
news about the california law which is
[SPEAKER_10]: that uh uh people who live on the uh
native american reservations here if they
[SPEAKER_10]: want to participate in the cannabis
industry they have to uh sign away their
[SPEAKER_10]: sovereign rights so uh there there is only
one cannabis company that's owned by a
[SPEAKER_10]: native american in the entire state nobody
that lives on the reservation who's going
[SPEAKER_10]: to sign away their sovereign rights to be
able to participate in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: industry it's an absolute travesty
travesty so yeah i was gonna gonna bring
[SPEAKER_15]: that up i'm in washington it's the same
similar deal because of the federal lack
[SPEAKER_15]: of federal um you know allowing allowance
that the tribes here they they in
[SPEAKER_15]: washington choose to operate underwater
they've done it they have a pack deal and
[SPEAKER_15]: it's been a big big to do it took them a
couple years to figure out they did some
[SPEAKER_15]: pack but they basically operate as if
they're licensed recreational stores you
[SPEAKER_15]: wouldn't know the difference they have the
same product they buy from 502 producers
[SPEAKER_15]: interestingly they they lined it up where
they can ship to other tribes so they kind
[SPEAKER_15]: of did have that forethought that they
could ship to any other sovereign nation
[SPEAKER_15]: you know tribe but um it's it's it's not
what you're talking about marcus you know
[SPEAKER_15]: and they didn't have the they didn't have
the guts i think because of the bar you
[SPEAKER_01]: know our federal deal you know and debbie
giving rights i mean that's the game right
[SPEAKER_01]: now and i don't necessarily want to get
into it right now we're dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: emergency all over the place here in
canada and sovereign rights are being
[SPEAKER_01]: given up left right and center and handing
it over i know that's a bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation but wow my heart goes in down
into the chair and i think people could
[SPEAKER_13]: look so relevant right now they could look
into what it means to be a sovereign
[SPEAKER_13]: i'm thankful for what's happening in
canada right now though because there is
[SPEAKER_13]: you know a medical program that is still
functioning and that is a good thing for
[SPEAKER_13]: medical people and i would just on the
note someone finding a strain or one
[SPEAKER_13]: particular varietal that works for them
and then being worried about whether they
[SPEAKER_13]: can get it again i think it's really
important for those people to look into
[SPEAKER_13]: potentially if they can having that strain
on their land and growing that is one of
[SPEAKER_13]: their four plants because especially in
canada you can do that and nothing nothing
[SPEAKER_13]: connects you know yeah grow your own and
now you're connected to the plant itself
[SPEAKER_13]: you're connected to the create life
creation process and you're making your
[SPEAKER_13]: own medicine which is a self-empowering
action and you're continuing to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: same varietal that works for you and if
you can grow four of your own and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do it outside because you don't
want to invest a whole bunch of money into
[SPEAKER_01]: having an indoor system and you don't know
how to do it well i really suggest that
[SPEAKER_01]: you do it regeneratively because if you
need those 200 milligram gummies
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the whole year then you want to
grow those plants really really big and
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to grow them heavy weight and you
want to grow really good medicine that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can have throughout the year and now that
is having sovereignty with cannabis so if
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to talk sovereignty with cannabis
everybody can grow cannabis still here in
[SPEAKER_01]: canada and really we all need the federal
government up on that and also have
[SPEAKER_17]: medical for more than than four i'm gonna
say yeah and those four plants can be as
[SPEAKER_17]: big as you can grow them look down south
they're growing plants getting 25 pounds
[SPEAKER_17]: out of one plant so i mean you can veg
this all through your winter inside if you
[SPEAKER_17]: want the first bed of sunshine put that
thing outside bury it in the dirt have
[SPEAKER_17]: those soils ready and feed that thing
because it's going to reach for the skies
[SPEAKER_17]: guys and and you can really because you're
not limited to how much you only limited
[SPEAKER_17]: to how many you can only carry 30 grams
with you but when you're at home sky's the
[SPEAKER_17]: limit so remember that so it's not about
you can get as much as you can there's
[SPEAKER_17]: different methods of growing four plants
indoors i did one plant under each light
[SPEAKER_17]: i've seen people now just at a place the
guy completely buns i had a plant made one
[SPEAKER_17]: plant really it's four feet by four feet i
was pretty amazed i'm gonna go back and
[SPEAKER_17]: take some pictures today this afternoon
it's really cool what people are doing out
[SPEAKER_17]: there with their four plant limit guys so
definitely grow your own i love it hey and
[SPEAKER_08]: i want to add to that grow your own i want
to give selena and the wise woman seed
[SPEAKER_08]: company a huge shout out because she gave
me this incredible pack of seeds from wise
[SPEAKER_08]: women seeds and they are like heir
heirloom heirloom to tomatoes you know
[SPEAKER_08]: like sage plants some violets some some
amaryth just like just endless amounts of
[SPEAKER_08]: awesome seeds all sorts of foods and
companion plants and i am definitely
[SPEAKER_08]: wanting to shout out wise woman seeds and
selena in particular for helping curate
[SPEAKER_08]: this for my wife and my family and i we're
going to build some i'm going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: talking to the dragonfly earth medicine
we're going to get some some proper area
[SPEAKER_08]: built up and some good soils in and uh
yeah get these seeds cracking grow your
[SPEAKER_01]: own baby because we're gonna head out to
the coast here soon we're gonna come help
[SPEAKER_17]: you build it awesome that's what's up
you're gonna stop by my place me too and
[SPEAKER_13]: help me yeah yeah definitely johnny for
sure we're without a doubt we're also
[SPEAKER_13]: we're also heading out to victoria um to
see a fight with um alias who is the first
[SPEAKER_13]: canadian athlete to be a thc cannabis
athlete and he's on our story right now so
[SPEAKER_13]: big love to alias and the work that he's
been doing at becoming a cannabis athlete
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're going to be supporting and really
pushing uh the the conversation forward
[SPEAKER_01]: that how silly that you're saying that
it's okay to use a plant but only part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and and this sort of you know uh
separatism has to has to end okay well you
[SPEAKER_01]: can use the plant but you can only use
part of the plant and if you use this part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant then you could be tested and
i mean it's just absolutely ridiculous i
[SPEAKER_01]: think that often humans run themselves in
a circle and eat their tail and we just
[SPEAKER_01]: need to stop this the plant gives us what
it needs in the right doses that for us to
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to get relief from and for us
to be able to live happier healthy lives
[SPEAKER_01]: especially athletes who are not really
supported except by sponsors and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: they only would get free material or or
you know free whatever from different
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsors but they're not supporting their
health their longevity and their
[SPEAKER_01]: well-being well into the future so that
conversation really needs to change
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a tremendous amount of
youth that look up to athletes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world and the athletes need to carry the
conversation forward with the sponsors
[SPEAKER_01]: backing them of education of health and
well-being so that the youth can be raised
[SPEAKER_13]: in that type of an education and i would
just add that part of cannabis what it's
[SPEAKER_13]: given us is earth conscious it's giving us
that nature awareness so like when johnny
[SPEAKER_13]: b's talking about having to go to the
store and get a stack of 10 milligram
[SPEAKER_13]: things i mean that's a lot of garbage so
why so and a lot of we're healing
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves while ailing the earth or we're
getting diabetes to be able to get 200
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams like let's create a little bit
of sense here in the idea of holistic
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding like and i have to bring it
back to science like we keep relying on
[SPEAKER_01]: only this idealized you know specific you
know standard that takes away all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: holistic versions of it and then we are
only looking at things with blinders on
[SPEAKER_01]: and the more that we sort of open up the
conversation and sure we can use that
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific experiment for one of the great
discoveries to be able to explain
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's fantastic but if we're
using it as the only way to explain
[SPEAKER_01]: something and also be able to make laws
and move forward on then we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: missing out on you know something so much
more deep and something so much more
[SPEAKER_13]: powerful for humanity as a whole also i'd
just say you know shout out to tara lee um
[SPEAKER_13]: tara lee has been um is doing a start your
own seed thing on her youtube channel so
[SPEAKER_13]: for home growers that are interested in
having a larger plant or a big plant in
[SPEAKER_13]: their backyard or even inside starting in
it now you know with the moon cycles is
[SPEAKER_13]: going to be a really good way to get a
large plant and then you have to decide
[SPEAKER_13]: how big of a pot you're going to put it in
and how many times you think you'll have
[SPEAKER_13]: to transplant it in a few months you know
two or three months it's going to take to
[SPEAKER_13]: put it in the ground but you know there's
some good in-depth conversation going on
[SPEAKER_01]: there and dem peer is going to be putting
out a contest but we don't want to call it
[SPEAKER_01]: a contest we want to call it a protest but
it's not like your traditional type of a
[SPEAKER_01]: protest it's sort of like a fun protest
and um put it out of like show us your
[SPEAKER_01]: four plants and you know talk about all
the other things that you could be growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and show us your your legal plants so that
all those people can partake in in this
[SPEAKER_13]: education too and and backyard trash stuff
backyard transformations we're seeing
[SPEAKER_13]: incredible backyard transformation it's
been unbelievable uh brian lamby on
[SPEAKER_13]: instagram you know has dug out his in the
lawn in his backyard and made trenches and
[SPEAKER_13]: put wood in there he's like i don't know
what i'm doing i'm throwing logs in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground we've watched people take up their
entire concrete in downtown la literally
[SPEAKER_01]: venting a jackhammer their entire concrete
that they had you know for 25 years is all
[SPEAKER_01]: dug up it goes on and on and on we've seen
so many pictures of people's backyards
[SPEAKER_13]: fully transformed we've been talking with
earth kind a lot over the years you are th
[SPEAKER_13]: k y and d earth kind and cannabism 420 he
lives in south central los angeles and
[SPEAKER_13]: sometimes in oregon but south central los
angeles and and we have as a group dem
[SPEAKER_13]: peer have been talking about creating a
regenerative uh farm not farm but an inner
[SPEAKER_13]: city urban farm where you transform a uh a
vacant lot into a beautiful garden and
[SPEAKER_13]: also he's talked about creating i think
this is good for other municipal areas
[SPEAKER_13]: where they have local backyard gardens
come together as a co-op and make medicine
[SPEAKER_13]: for themselves so neighborhoods of people
getting together growing four plants in
[SPEAKER_13]: their backyard and then creating meetings
where they can share how to make medicine
[SPEAKER_13]: together and they all make the medicine
together to work to give to themselves
[SPEAKER_13]: throughout the winter it's
self-empowerment it's community
[SPEAKER_13]: empowerment and it's it's herbalism you
know it's it's learning about herbalism
[SPEAKER_13]: because you'll always have companions and
plants you'll always have flowers and mint
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the other and what brings
community together better than talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about their buds that they grew in their
backyard i mean come on we all love
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about our buds that we grow so
it's it's you know josh and i always say
[SPEAKER_01]: that backyard gardens you know are going
to save the world and actually believe
[SPEAKER_01]: that it might be the only thing can they
have to to save the world so i think it's
[SPEAKER_13]: like a beetle song they miss wrote it it's
come together right now over weed i like
[SPEAKER_08]: it sorry i'm uh dealing with uh on the
side here someone who's my admin has
[SPEAKER_08]: offended in one of my groups i don't think
people realize how hard it is to
[SPEAKER_08]: administrate these groups on facebook and
that there's a lot of people who go there
[SPEAKER_08]: just to kind of cause trouble and we're
just kind of trying to curate these groups
[SPEAKER_08]: to share information to let everyone kind
of gain information and it's endless how
[SPEAKER_08]: many people hit me oh your mod deleted me
or i treated me poorly and i'm just like
[SPEAKER_08]: man it's because of the stress he has this
poor guy is litter and he's been on hash
[SPEAKER_08]: church before this poor guy has done a lot
of good in these groups he shared an
[SPEAKER_08]: enormous amount of knowledge with people
and you just can't win with these hey i
[SPEAKER_07]: want to like to shout out a few things

[SPEAKER_07]: patients out of time they're having their
25th anniversary right now and of course
[SPEAKER_07]: the emerald cup uh we're actually uh yeah
we actually changed the actual voting in
[SPEAKER_07]: the last couple of days because uh
packaging and labeling was part of the
[SPEAKER_07]: overall and now that's been pulled out and
it's going to be a separate part of the um
[SPEAKER_07]: competition all together so pushing for
environmentally sound packaging and um
[SPEAKER_07]: last but not least just to be uh to deal
with the realism um we lost an employee
[SPEAKER_07]: this week at berkeley patients group one
of our employees she was only 30 years old
[SPEAKER_07]: morgan medina passed away suddenly this
week so um prayers and ups and love i've
[SPEAKER_07]: never lost an employee actually um we've
had others retire and pass away but um
[SPEAKER_07]: shout out to their friends families and
employees and support out there and you
[SPEAKER_07]: know uh she was one who just celebrated
her one year anniversary with us just last
[SPEAKER_07]: week and uh she had extra care and love

[SPEAKER_07]: unsung heroes that helped everybody so uh
much love and respect thanks for sharing
[SPEAKER_08]: that etienne that's sorry sorry to hear
that go ahead debbie so sorry i'm gonna
[SPEAKER_10]: blame my uh stuttering behavior on the raw
garden stab i did a few minutes ago
[SPEAKER_10]: because i like forgot how to use the
english language for a minute but i think
[SPEAKER_10]: i'm back um no our buddy uh bo from oregon
passed away too i want to mention that he
[SPEAKER_10]: is uh no no no and bo for probably 30 the
entire 32 years i've been involved in the
[SPEAKER_10]: movement and um shout out to the oregon
family and uh yeah yeah we love you and
[SPEAKER_10]: happy valentine's day everyone too i want
to say that let's keep love for each other
[SPEAKER_07]: all the time oh bo uh uh i was a general
manager for ed rosenthal and for his first
[SPEAKER_07]: trial i had to disappear and i disappeared
a few times and uh bo hid me up in oregon
[SPEAKER_07]: for three weeks and allowed me to go to
work in the gardens for john sejo and the
[SPEAKER_07]: oregon crew of which i went and fixed the
gardens they had a whole bunch of large
[SPEAKER_07]: plants that were overgrown with white
pottery mildew so i went in and fixed the
[SPEAKER_07]: plants the whole time i was kind of you
know sentenced up there and bo fed me hid
[SPEAKER_07]: me out gave me the room and everything man
much love bo you were a great spirit and
[SPEAKER_10]: condolences to the bpg posse that is never
easy no and thank you just to remember
[SPEAKER_07]: every body you know we never know if today

[SPEAKER_07]: and love and remind each other that you
know life is short life is quick and we
[SPEAKER_07]: have the time that we have so enjoy it and
don't forget to tell anybody you love them
[SPEAKER_07]: and uh in that case i love you all
especially all you all here nice love love
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys sorry for your loss i really love
you guys thanks so much and i just wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to say that this time has you know created
such incredible divisiveness you know in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world in politics um and now you know
unfortunately even within own households
[SPEAKER_01]: so you know this divide is being felt
everywhere and and it's running really
[SPEAKER_01]: really deep and i guess just since it's
valentine's day you know i think that
[SPEAKER_01]: building bridges for love is really
important and you know if we're gonna make
[SPEAKER_01]: a choice and i just always really resonate
with what the the ancient buddhas say and
[SPEAKER_01]: and and the dreamers who dreamed this
existence into time and that's love and
[SPEAKER_01]: fear and i just really encourage everyone
listening and all of us and even myself to
[SPEAKER_01]: really resonate and fear and i mean
resonate and love and to outride fear
[SPEAKER_01]: because it really isn't serving anything
and it just creates a continuous noise so
[SPEAKER_01]: happy valentine's day everybody and here's
to love you know on that note i think i'm
[SPEAKER_08]: gonna cut her short today i've got my wife
and my child waiting on the other side of
[SPEAKER_08]: the door to go hang out and go for a nice
little hike i have absolutely enjoyed
