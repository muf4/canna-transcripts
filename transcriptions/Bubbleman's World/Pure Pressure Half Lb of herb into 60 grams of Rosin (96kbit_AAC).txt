[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys welcome to bubble man's world
today we're gonna be doing something that
[SPEAKER_06]: I've said I was gonna do quite a while ago
now we're gonna get the pure pressure the
[SPEAKER_06]: long the long peaks Press going and what
we're gonna be doing is we're going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: squishing a half pound of where is my bike
so I thought I'd take you through a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit of the workflow although you have seen
a little bit of it beautiful beautiful
[SPEAKER_06]: half pound of where is my bike on point as
always try to do a little bit more video
[SPEAKER_06]: of the bud for you the buds are quite big
they're definitely larger than what I like
[SPEAKER_06]: to press some people don't prepare the
herb at all they just you know press it
[SPEAKER_06]: the way the way it is I like to make sure
when the bags are full and I'll be using
[SPEAKER_06]: 115 micron bags today these are the 2.5
inch by 9 inch which fits perfectly in
[SPEAKER_06]: this press right here in this template
little pre press unit from pure pressure
[SPEAKER_06]: got my nitrile gloves here powder free and
latex free I've got my little tool for
[SPEAKER_06]: both flipping the bags inside out which I
can show you real quick as leaving the
[SPEAKER_06]: seam on the outside we know that we're
gonna collect a lot of resin there and
[SPEAKER_06]: that's not really ideal so we just put the
bag over that way and it's real quick to
[SPEAKER_06]: flip the bag inside out so we'll be doing
probably about seven of these as I can fit
[SPEAKER_06]: about 30 to 35 grams in each one so I'll
probably do seven of those at one point in
[SPEAKER_06]: time and I'll be I'll be putting on my
gloves so we can get the buds broken up
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a couple of trays here I'll
probably weigh out 30 grams at a time
[SPEAKER_06]: throw it in here get it into the bag
pre-press the bag put it over here and
[SPEAKER_06]: repeat until the whole half-pound is taken
care of it's I'm guessing it's 224 to 230
[SPEAKER_06]: grams in here so that's gonna be like six
and a bit bags really quite lovely bud
[SPEAKER_06]: though there we go yep yep yep yep yep yep
yeah all right put that great terpena lean
[SPEAKER_06]: smell and yeah I'm looking forward I've
got the press you might hear the air
[SPEAKER_06]: compressor go on every once in a while as
I've got it up to 140 psi anytime it drops
[SPEAKER_06]: below that it turns on and goes up the
press is also on the plates are heated I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: heating today we're gonna be doing 220
some say it's too hot I can assure you the
[SPEAKER_06]: resin is actually absolutely terp rich
when it comes out it's gonna be a
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful yellow golden color and it's
gonna be very glossy and it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_06]: very terpy I've got the little funnel here
which I love for placing inside the screen
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I usually just sort of collect
the herb and I use the little stick to
[SPEAKER_06]: pound it through the hole and pack it down
into the bag nicely any little spaces that
[SPEAKER_06]: you leave generally in the screen
particularly in the corners or on the
[SPEAKER_06]: sides are going to collect and pool rosin
and every little bit counts you end up
[SPEAKER_06]: losing more than you need to lose so those
are just simple things to keep in mind and
[SPEAKER_06]: rather than video record this entire
preparation of all this bud I thought what
[SPEAKER_06]: I would do is do a time lapse for you so I
am going to change the camera put it on
[SPEAKER_06]: time lapse for you guys go through this
entire half pound and then we'll video
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the presses or all of the presses
it's gonna be real nice we're gonna do 35
[SPEAKER_06]: gram raw bags each time and I suspect with
the where's my bike that we'll get
[SPEAKER_06]: anywhere from 25 to 30 percent return 28
to 29 would put a big smile on my face so
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah why don't we get started
[SPEAKER_02]: right from the start
[SPEAKER_02]: the old medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: maintaining the balance with pleasure and
pain we'll get to where you wanna sick and
[SPEAKER_02]: feel tired as the light goes out the drain
we'll get to where you wanna sustaining,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy living, sipping clean food and
clean water we'll get to where you wanna
[SPEAKER_02]: let me tell you something about the
cellulose it's a natural tetrabalite
[SPEAKER_02]: ignite the body function with electrolytes
[SPEAKER_06]: that was fun that took me about a half an
hour although on the time lapse I'm sure
[SPEAKER_06]: it's only gonna be a minute or two and
yeah we got six 35 gram bags pre-pressed
[SPEAKER_06]: and loaded and ready to go got a few extra
buds that I kept out here for photography
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna do some macro photography so you
guys can see the glandular trichome heads
[SPEAKER_06]: excuse me and I'll also do a few photos
just of the buds themselves and some video
[SPEAKER_06]: of them up close so you can see the
quality of the bud that I'm working with
[SPEAKER_06]: and I guess next up is let's go do the
pressing I'm gonna probably do one full
[SPEAKER_06]: press where I take you through creating
the recipe I take you through the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: process of what will change our gloves as
well because we've fingered up these ones
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty good and yeah I think I like the
time lapse so what we'll probably do is
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take you through one squish on
regular time we can watch it nice and
[SPEAKER_06]: close up dripping and then I think I'm
gonna do the time lapse for the pressing
[SPEAKER_06]: as well just to kind of make the video not
two hours long not that it would be that
[SPEAKER_06]: long I usually press for a couple of
minutes per bag and there's only six bags
[SPEAKER_06]: here so even if I did a full three minute
press still be under 20 minutes although I
[SPEAKER_06]: do like to go back and do a second press
as well so I'll record that for you guys
[SPEAKER_06]: so why don't we head into the rosin office
and get this job done the compressor just
[SPEAKER_06]: loaded up to 150 psi so we've got a little
bit of give I've got my set six sheets of
[SPEAKER_06]: pre-cut parchment paper from pure pressure
that are sitting right here I've got one
[SPEAKER_06]: of the plates for pressing the templates
to hold it down so it doesn't slide out in
[SPEAKER_06]: that way I have it accessible right here
I've got my six filled screens pre-pressed
[SPEAKER_06]: right here and then I've got some older
parchment pieces that I've already pressed
[SPEAKER_06]: once you know some are a little bit more
dirty than others but generally this is
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of what they look like and that way
when I do a second press I've got sheets
[SPEAKER_06]: that are ready and I don't what I can do
is I can do my first press and while I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: collecting the first press I can actually
go and collect the second press so what
[SPEAKER_06]: we're going to do right now is I'm going
to do a full press and show you what we
[SPEAKER_06]: get and then we're going to do the
time-lapse showing all the rest of the
[SPEAKER_06]: five getting pressed really quickly and
then I'll do a collection I'll do that on
[SPEAKER_06]: time-lapse as well I'll collect one maybe
off of time-lapse and collect the rest of
[SPEAKER_06]: time-lapse do a pre-press through the D
nail press of getting it all into a nice
[SPEAKER_06]: big orb and that'll be it we'll do the
second press and you guys will see how
[SPEAKER_06]: easy it is to work with the long peaks
pure pressure and let's get started shall
[SPEAKER_06]: we okay so here we have the settings right
here there's all set up if we go to our
[SPEAKER_06]: recipes and we go where is my bike so I've
got this set up we're gonna change this a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit the weight is actually 35 oops
35 grams so we'll get that up there the
[SPEAKER_06]: bags are actually 2.5 by 9 it is 115 we'll
go for a medium speed the humidity is way
[SPEAKER_06]: closer to 60 than it is to 16 and then
we'll do three stages stage one we're
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna do 60 seconds and the pressure we're
gonna go at is 140 psi and we'll repeat
[SPEAKER_06]: that as well and the reason I do this and
not just one full stage is at any point in
[SPEAKER_06]: time I like to just I can shut her down
obviously you can do it however you like
[SPEAKER_06]: you can do it all in one stage your third
stage second stage at a much higher psi
[SPEAKER_06]: 140 psi is a little bit too high for hash
but it works great for flour and these are
[SPEAKER_06]: all things that you learn over time when
you okay let's just make sure that saved
[SPEAKER_06]: the way I wanted it to yeah it just missed
my third one so we'll go 60 we'll go
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure 140 we'll save and then we'll
save and run yeah there it is perfect all
[SPEAKER_06]: right so here we go with our our where is
my bike and if you're wondering where the
[SPEAKER_06]: E is there's not enough letters so I'm
gonna pull the camera back so you guys can
[SPEAKER_06]: see the press and we'll get going
[SPEAKER_06]: nice and long cut perfectly for the unit
just pull them over and make sure there's
[SPEAKER_06]: no crinkles in it we've got some magnets
here that I've got that I use now there's
[SPEAKER_06]: also a little handle sorry it says right
on it not a handle there's this little
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of clip that allows you to hold the
bag in I don't use it so much as I like
[SPEAKER_06]: the bag to have the parchment to hang a
little bit lower than that is set up but
[SPEAKER_06]: it is there for you if you want to use it
we'll get our bag in what I generally like
[SPEAKER_06]: to do because I really like the placement
of this to be up top which we've talked
[SPEAKER_06]: about before so you can pull the bag out
once you've opened the pressed rosin but
[SPEAKER_06]: what I do like to do is I like to make
sure like I don't generally put it in like
[SPEAKER_06]: that before I pre lower the the plate so
what we're gonna do is we're going to hold
[SPEAKER_06]: these two buttons down which are going to
go for five seconds three two one and
[SPEAKER_06]: we're ready we're gonna lower these plates
just a tiny bit just a tiny bit and that
[SPEAKER_06]: gives us a tighter space to press down on
the on the bag with so I'm gonna get kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of out of the way here I'm gonna lower
this down get that toggle proper
[SPEAKER_06]: generally after about 10 to 30 seconds
you'll start getting the rosin coming out
[SPEAKER_06]: and that is where is my bike never a
disappointment with where is my bike so
[SPEAKER_06]: we've got a couple of drips happening now
and we'll hold this up so it doesn't go
[SPEAKER_06]: all the way down it's a nice squish for
sure and that's generally what it looks
[SPEAKER_06]: like when you squish flour that has proper
resin content on it I'm sure if we went
[SPEAKER_06]: around to the back of the unit right now
we'd see a little bit squishing out the
[SPEAKER_06]: back as well and you can see it right in
there boom all right so this is just a
[SPEAKER_06]: quick minute so far minute and 30 seconds
and you can see there's still really nice
[SPEAKER_06]: flow the drips are collecting at the
bottom here starting to fatten up and
[SPEAKER_06]: we've still got flow generally when you
still have flow like this and you're
[SPEAKER_06]: almost done your your two minute press
it's not a bad idea to just continue on
[SPEAKER_06]: otherwise you're gonna have to go back and
do a second press and you're gonna expose
[SPEAKER_06]: it to more heat in the second press than
you will if you just do a full two to
[SPEAKER_06]: three minutes first press quite lovely
look at that
[SPEAKER_06]: all right we're in our last 60 seconds of
pressing here
[SPEAKER_06]: and she is a bubbling you know there's
always people that are gonna say oh if you
[SPEAKER_06]: don't want to get the bubbles you got to
press a lot lighter it's this is a
[SPEAKER_06]: subjective thing you can press however you
like anywhere between 180 and 220
[SPEAKER_06]: Fahrenheit is seemingly pretty good you
might end up with a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_06]: buttery consistency versus a shattery
consistency depending on the resin but you
[SPEAKER_06]: can play around with your times and your
pressure I like 220 for flour between 200
[SPEAKER_06]: and 220 but with the moisture content when
it's high 220 is perfect for me and the
[SPEAKER_06]: PSI I like to go up to 140 so we are
pressing at 137 psi right now we've got
[SPEAKER_06]: six seconds left and this is gonna crack
open I'll have to put the camera down yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna put the camera down real quickly
here all right so I didn't have the record
[SPEAKER_06]: button on when it popped open but that is
our squish right there very reasonable by
[SPEAKER_06]: flower standards I'm definitely feeling
above a 25% return and we're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: collect this one right away so let's go do
[SPEAKER_04]: that as you can see a pretty clean pretty
clean pickup on that generally when you're
[SPEAKER_06]: working with you know what I consider
near-perfect resin grown to perfection
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful cultivar that's able to express
itself in the first place you just end up
[SPEAKER_06]: with a real nice easy resin to squish to
collect everything about it is pleasant
[SPEAKER_06]: there we
[SPEAKER_04]: go without touching any resin with that
sheet pretty darn clean we've got
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves a beautiful beautiful piece
we're gonna throw that on the scale and
[SPEAKER_06]: see what we've got tear it a little piece
of parchment I like to twist the tool to
[SPEAKER_06]: get the rosin off of it usually works
pretty good and that's a nine grammer nine
[SPEAKER_06]: grammars that's pretty darn good that's a
little under 30% I'd say we're at about 27
[SPEAKER_06]: 28% but there's gonna be another squish in
the second one so very very nice results
[SPEAKER_06]: for a first squish beautiful color and
yeah I'm quite happy with that look at
[SPEAKER_06]: that golden deliciousness right there so
why don't we leave that one there we'll
[SPEAKER_06]: come back and do some pressing in a bit
and let's go press the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: strike lightning as the morning break
might even something why the Sun was up in
[SPEAKER_02]: my face the wisdom of the wise
[SPEAKER_06]: so for this last one I thought we would
watch the goop drip it's all so much fun
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already done five of them I held off
on the collection so we're gonna do that
[SPEAKER_06]: all at once make sure everything's proper
nice deep spot for pressing let's get this
[SPEAKER_06]: going up
[SPEAKER_06]: so I push the two buttons for five seconds
I use the toggle switch to bring the plate
[SPEAKER_06]: down just a little bit that way it creates
a tighter area and I can kind of squeeze
[SPEAKER_06]: the bag in and control where that little
bit of make sure your screen doesn't pop
[SPEAKER_06]: out you can lower it really nice and
slowly so we've got 138 psi so we're good
[SPEAKER_06]: I turned off the loud air compressor
because nobody needs to hear that but this
[SPEAKER_06]: should be a good press right here this
should be a good press the quality of the
[SPEAKER_06]: whereas my bike is just second to none it
is absolutely gorgeous to squish I always
[SPEAKER_06]: like to count my streams I like when I get
10 or 11 oh we've got seven but they're
[SPEAKER_06]: long just a beautiful press got some good
motion on this one over here she's a
[SPEAKER_06]: dripping big clear dome window on the
inside there and like I said when we go to
[SPEAKER_06]: the back you can also generally see in
there that you've got a nice little squish
[SPEAKER_06]: happening as well beautiful so as you can
see the long peaks is quite a lovely
[SPEAKER_06]: little press to press on it's very
controllable I love the the dual buttons I
[SPEAKER_06]: love the dual toggle I love the emergency
stop not that I've needed to use it as of
[SPEAKER_06]: yet but it is a nice option and of course
there's our recipe going to town right
[SPEAKER_06]: there showing us our maximum psi reached
the amount of time that we pressed for and
[SPEAKER_06]: generally I've weighed the first one I got
almost 10 grams it was nine point
[SPEAKER_06]: something I'm sure with the second presses
that I will do on these that we will see
[SPEAKER_06]: another gram come out of rosin out of each
one of those so we'll get those done next
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful so five seconds left I usually
get my magnets off pull it out put my
[SPEAKER_06]: fingers underneath to hold the bag blade
the top of the bag like that grab that
[SPEAKER_06]: little piece so you can get it out without
spreading any of your resin around that
[SPEAKER_06]: looks like a real nice squish so let's go
do some collecting my life it's my life
[SPEAKER_08]: it's my life and it's your life it's your
life it's your life but if we come
[SPEAKER_08]: together for one life we're coming from
behind behind
[SPEAKER_05]: all right the air compressor is pumping
it's about how loud it is generally and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing the second presses now so I've
got it up to 140 psi again you can see a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit coming out I'm hoping to get
about an extra gram gram and a half which
[SPEAKER_05]: will put each bag at 10 which will give me
a solid 60 grams from a half pound which
[SPEAKER_05]: is a little bit lower than the 30 percent
it's around 27 28 percent return so maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get more than a gram gram and a half
on the second press we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: like 73 or 90 micron
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-kilometer All right, well the
compressor finally shut off that's why the
[SPEAKER_06]: music was playing there and yeah We're
getting some decent returns here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like at least a half gram to a
gram and a bit per bag So, you know when
[SPEAKER_06]: there's six bags, that's another quarter
plus You know quarter to ten grams of
[SPEAKER_06]: rosin that you would have otherwise not
gotten I don't think we're gonna get 70
[SPEAKER_06]: grams off a half pound But I certainly
think we'll get above 60 in total.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already got 55.6 in the other bag So
this is gonna crack open in about 15
[SPEAKER_06]: seconds All right a little bit there
anyway I'm gonna do this one that had a
[SPEAKER_06]: mild I had one that I kind of pushed out a
little bit There's gonna be some decent
[SPEAKER_06]: resin in that little guy right there There
it is Always be very careful as you're
[SPEAKER_06]: removing, you know lowering the toggle
down if you've got your fingers in and
[SPEAKER_06]: around in and around that area You really
really really I don't think I have to say
[SPEAKER_06]: this but you want to avoid pressing your
fingers That is gonna be no bueno All
[SPEAKER_06]: right, let's see the rosin starting to
come out already.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a lovely cultivar shout out to Maple
butter boys for growing some incredible
[SPEAKER_06]: herb shout out to karma genetics for
breeding some incredible herb for those Of
[SPEAKER_06]: you that don't know about the where is my
bike it is from karma genetics It is the
[SPEAKER_06]: amnesia haze I believe pre-98 cut if I've
got that right or 98 cut and it is crossed
[SPEAKER_06]: with the biker Kush So a real producer
across with this real beautiful sativa,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know euphoric effects almost amnesia
like effects to be honest and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: look we left a little bit of rosin behind
on this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dripping on a second So, you know
that there's a decent amount in there if
[SPEAKER_06]: it's gonna get the drip going Turpinoline
rich very very sativa very euphoric
[SPEAKER_06]: uplifting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people love it Some people don't love
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can cause a little bit of anxiety and
those that aren't heavy smokers But heavy
[SPEAKER_06]: smokers generally really like this
cultivar Great quick, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I've been working maybe an hour
and a half total and I've squished a half
[SPEAKER_06]: pound I've got close to 60 grams of rosin
that I've produced top quality rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna keep it Myself because it's
beautiful and it's my medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll probably keep me in rosin for the
next Three four months probably all the
[SPEAKER_06]: way through the summer But I know the
maple butter boys have this cultivar
[SPEAKER_06]: available So I'm not sure if they're still
retailing or what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I know another group Recently that
I've been promoting and helping which is
[SPEAKER_06]: sea to sky extracts and dabs to go you can
check them out on Instagram if you
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't mind going and given those two
accounts follow they also have Where is my
[SPEAKER_06]: bike and a lot of the varieties that I've
been pressing lately because I got some of
[SPEAKER_06]: the flower from them so the choco lope the
God bud The where is my bike they've got
[SPEAKER_06]: some decent varieties available as well
and I consulted and trained their guys so
[SPEAKER_06]: they're using the Long Peaks press as well
and All right, not a ton there but
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a little bit It's true the kind
of real cloudy like I say
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I collected The other three
that I squished so far and got two point
[SPEAKER_06]: five grams I suspect in total I'll
probably get Maybe four Let's see what
[SPEAKER_06]: happens All right the compressors off
again and so thus is the music we've got
[SPEAKER_06]: Little bit coming out on this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not quite as much my battery is about to
die.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna switch that out right away
and then Right second last one here Whoops
[SPEAKER_06]: a Little bit of slip sliding but not too
bad still got the majority of the resin
[SPEAKER_06]: there got a tiny bit on my glove at the
bottom but Will survive it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get right to the last one and then
down she goes Music
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so this is the last Squish of
all the squishes I've done.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done six bags twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the 12th squish and It's
actually giving us a little drip.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna get a substantial amount I
have gotten four grams so far out of the
[SPEAKER_06]: second press I got over 55 grams for the
first press so I'm looking at about a
[SPEAKER_06]: hundred or sorry sixty to sixty two grams
of rosin per half pound so that's like 120
[SPEAKER_06]: to 124 grams I have seen as high as 130
130 plus from this upwards of 30 percent,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I certainly won't Be upset with a 27
to 28 percent return All right I've
[SPEAKER_06]: already pretty much removed all the other
ones but once we come and we'll do this
[SPEAKER_06]: last one together and We'll show you what
we ended up getting and yeah, we'll finish
[SPEAKER_06]: off this video All right Press plate out
of the way Make sure we get all little
[SPEAKER_06]: particulates of herb usually I would have
swept this all up, but I've been a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit preoccupied also, be careful when
you're collecting on an oil slick or a
[SPEAKER_06]: Silicone mat like this and generally why
that is because it's soft and if you do
[SPEAKER_06]: the collection The way I do the collection
you can tear through the screen I learned
[SPEAKER_06]: that with Johnny B the other day when we
did his kush and So I'm just a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: more careful on this I do have to say I
like collecting on a larger surface area
[SPEAKER_06]: with this small dabber that being said
These guys have sent me a really nice
[SPEAKER_06]: collection tool that I have not yet used
yet I have a hard time collecting with a
[SPEAKER_06]: tool that has such a flat large surface
area It just feels like it's gonna make it
[SPEAKER_06]: more difficult To get the rosin off that
being said that is an assumption that I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: having and I could potentially just Give
it a shot and see see how easy it actually
[SPEAKER_06]: is so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys haven't let me down They have
engineered the machine quite beautifully
[SPEAKER_06]: and as well as the tools very simple tools
But well your life sure becomes more
[SPEAKER_06]: difficult when you don't have those simple
little tools to Prepare your bud with you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys saw how easy it was to break the buds
up and then jam them through the little
[SPEAKER_06]: funnel With the little stick as well as
flipping the bags inside out all that
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff just makes life easier So we'll put
that on our second Batch and there's you
[SPEAKER_06]: know, I'd say there's four point five
grams of seconds here We'll get this out
[SPEAKER_06]: of the way Look at our scale out.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a beautiful cookie Almost 60
grams of where is my bike in your face?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got some weight to it I won't lie.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is serious weight right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's tear this other Section of the
sheet there goes the air compressor in the
[SPEAKER_06]: background So yeah, this is just over 55
grams actually fifty five point zero six
[SPEAKER_06]: Not quite as high as I thought and this is
about four point three a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: different on the tear so We've got just
under 60 grams here If we go quickly here
[SPEAKER_06]: to my little calculator My percentage
calculator You can zip that up right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what we got here 60 grams Now I
didn't actually wavier but I'm guessing it
[SPEAKER_06]: was an accurate half pound It could have
been a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know it was a little bit less
because I kept out Nine grams right here,
[SPEAKER_06]: so it's probably more accurately
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just make that a little bit more
accurate 15 grams Twenty eight point zero
[SPEAKER_06]: three percent is What we have gotten here
with that press pretty solid return.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not gonna lie And I'm not sure what
I'm gonna do with this big patty.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I could Get a big piece of
parchment and press it out into a big Disc
[SPEAKER_06]: why don't I do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be right back Alright, so I ended up
pressing that up into a nice disc as you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys can see here It's very thick It's a
thick piece 55 plus grams and just yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: it looks great Let me see if I can't get
the camera off the tripod here
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful beautiful beautiful you can
already see within it There's a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: of buttering going on and this will butter
eventually
[SPEAKER_06]: All right Why don't we do a quick dab?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's pull the tiniest little
section of this out
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna probably squish another Another
little bit today, so I still got a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit of work ahead of me, but Let's get a
little quick dab out of the mothership
[SPEAKER_06]: mini shall we?
[SPEAKER_06]: I time 20 seconds heated and I usually
leave it for between 50 and a minute of
[SPEAKER_06]: cool down That also depends on how high
you have the torch so the torch isn't
[SPEAKER_06]: super high right now almost 20 second heat
up There we go and I'm gonna have to run
[SPEAKER_06]: and get q-tips in between this because I
Not sure what I did with my my busters
[SPEAKER_06]: Always with the q-tips always with the
q-tips there's one right there perfect All
[SPEAKER_06]: right, we got a 45 second 50 That sounds
about right
[SPEAKER_06]: Got some DC glass cleaner
[SPEAKER_06]: For those times that you hit it a little
bit hot not that that was too hot it
[SPEAKER_06]: cleaned out quite beautifully with the DC
