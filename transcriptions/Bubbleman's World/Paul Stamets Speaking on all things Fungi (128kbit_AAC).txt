Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
I forgot something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on your seats, of course, you've all
got the little gifts of extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've also got this fabulous
bookmark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're looking at it, you're saying,
great, I'm going to read something with
[SPEAKER_03]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn it over on the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it is signed by Paul, you have been
given a free copy of Marcellia Running.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he will sign it for you up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That subsequent to this talk, your lives
will forever be changed for the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a culmination of over 40 years of
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just so honored to be the
messenger of this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard, and I know it's not
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't claim ownership of this knowledge,
but I feel like I'm a conduit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of this talk, there's an
epiphany that has taken me 30 years to
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Epiphany usually happens faster than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want you to clear your receptor
sites, open up your minds, take a deep
[SPEAKER_01]: breath, hold onto your proverbial hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do speak rather quickly,
but the avalanche of knowledge that is
[SPEAKER_01]: about to wash over you is something that
really speaks to Gaian intelligence,
[SPEAKER_01]: the intelligence of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just so honored at this
time-critical period in the evolution of
[SPEAKER_01]: life on this planet that I'm alive to be
one of the messengers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be more messengers,
obviously, in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So OK, so I want to tell you about my hat,
because Jeff has one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I wanted to first, I want to dedicate
this talk to Steve Sheppard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve, will you please stand up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Steve Sheppard is the chair of
entomology at Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our relationship has been magical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been catalytic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dance of minds and spirits that I
think synergizes to something that will
[SPEAKER_01]: lead to an evolutionary jump and what we
can do to help this planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this hat is made from a mushroom called
amadou.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amadou is a birch polypore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard wood con.
[SPEAKER_01]: And amadou is a mushroom that really is
responsible for why it's called amadou.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humans survived, especially thousands of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt that we came from Africa
40,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We migrated north into Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We discovered something new called winter
boots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this mushroom allowed for the
portability of fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called a tinder trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our ancestors realized that you hollow
this mushroom out, put embers of fire
[SPEAKER_01]: inside, it can carry fire for days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now ceremonially, today, in First Peoples,
the fire keeper of the clan has a very
[SPEAKER_01]: important symbolic role.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not too long ago, they literally held
the life of the clan in their hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as you approach the winter,
if you couldn't kindle a fire,
[SPEAKER_01]: then of course the freezing temperatures
would be very, very detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moreover, this mushroom, when you put
it into live water, ashes and water,
[SPEAKER_01]: and pull it out for a few days,
it delaminates into mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this mushroom is made of mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this tradition has been going on for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This hat is actually made by some ladies
in China, Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's about seven or eight hat
makers a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's only three or four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an example of the thread of
knowledge that goes through time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of disease, war, religious
persecution, accidents, the threads of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge have been clipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why it's so important with
First Peoples here, and the Western North
[SPEAKER_01]: America in particular, there are oral
traditions where there's disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they lose their elders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lose that contact, you know,
to the ancient past.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this mushroom also revolutionized
warfare.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Napoleonic times, this mushroom became
the punk that made flint spark guns work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It created the spark that ignited the
gunpowder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a massive amount of trade in
the Napoleonic times of the Ahmadi
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This mushroom also is the first mushroom
ever found to have an antibial property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly active against the mosaic virus,
which afflicts many, many plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this mushroom has other properties
that are key to the ecosystem that I'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: showing you in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a few other fungal friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be talking about amadou a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be talking about the red reishi
mushroom that I have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be hearing about the red-belted
polypore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is called the phometopsis pinicula.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all up on the slide here,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I hold these up, you can see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is another birch polypore
called chata, internotus obliquus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are four of the species I'll be
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have one other friend that I brought
with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is agaricon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agaricon grows exclusively in the Old
Growth Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's known as phometopsis aficionalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is now thought to be extinct largely in
Europe, on few sky islands in Austria and
[SPEAKER_01]: Slovenia, and the high Alps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in other words, largely extinct in
Europe because they cut down the Old
[SPEAKER_01]: Growth Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still grows in Northern California,
Oregon, Washington state, and here in
[SPEAKER_01]: British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diasporidae describe this mushroom in 65
AD, 2,000 years ago, as elixirium adlongum
[SPEAKER_01]: bitum, the elixir of long life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this mushroom, I suggest to you,
is similar in significance in terms of its
[SPEAKER_01]: medical and benefit for human survival as
we enter into the next century.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the title of my talk is Mushroom
Mycelium and the World Wide Food Web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And microdiversity is essential for
biosecurity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in this wonderful planet,
but we've now entered into 6X.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sixth greatest extinction event known
in the history of life on this planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this extinction event is not caused by
an asteroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not caused by methane hydrate bursts
out of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not caused by cosmic rays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's caused by an organism, by us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only with the cause of this extinction
event, but we're very likely to be its
[SPEAKER_01]: victim.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there is a path for human
survival in the dance of nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is if we follow the path of
mycelium, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be well rewarded as well
justified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, unfortunately, there's a lot of bad
news before we get to the good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an article that came out in
Science just recently, and basically 58%
[SPEAKER_01]: of the species richness in the land masses
have gone now down below the carrying
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity for sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have fracturing ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're artificially supporting our food web
through the importation of foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have factory farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the pursuit of efficiency, we lose
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a context here, but when we
bring fungi into the conversation in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of ecological stability, there's lots of
benefits that are being reached.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's first go back in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a pictograph in a cave in northern
Algeria that's silly in a dark plateau.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was from 7,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting to me because there
is a term that Argonne Wasson described.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called mycophobia, the irrational
fear of fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really quite clear what the
artist's intention was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The artist was really excited about my
shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though this was published in
several scientific journals, none of the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists would dare speculate what the
intent of the artist was or what these
[SPEAKER_01]: little figures were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think this speaks to something
that also afflicts the sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our experiential abuse game,
we have long-term contact with animals and
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a familiarity factor with
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come up and they disappear in a few
days, typically the fleshier mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so mushrooms that are so ephemeral,
and you only encounter them very
[SPEAKER_01]: infrequently, and they're suddenly gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with something that can feed you,
that can kill you, that can heal you,
[SPEAKER_01]: that can send you on a psychedelic
spiritual journey, and yet it disappears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our experiential context is very,
very limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's natural for humans to fear that
which is so powerful, but which is not
[SPEAKER_01]: well understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've come to a new threshold of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this knowledge, I think, is just
really revolutionary in its implications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, going forward in time, this is 450
BCE.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a cotylet where Demeter is
giving Persephone a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And upon consuming the mushroom,
then she goes into the underworld.
[SPEAKER_01]: This speaks to the origination and Greek
culture of the seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the winter would ensue,
and then the spring, she would come back
[SPEAKER_01]: up, and the crops would grow, and warmer
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the cycle of the seasons,
all related to Demeter giving Persephone
[SPEAKER_01]: this mushroom, and she went into the
underworld.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great book called The Road to
Eleusis, The Euclidean Mysteries,
[SPEAKER_01]: that speaks about the religious use of
psychoactive mushrooms by the Greek
[SPEAKER_01]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plato, Sophocles, Aristotle, all parts of
these magical mushroom brews, and a great
[SPEAKER_01]: celestial in Greek culture, thousands of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Hippocrates, around 460 BCE,
first mentioned Amidou for carterizing
[SPEAKER_01]: wounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was recognized back then as being
highly flammable, and it was very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very good as an anti-inflammatory,
as well as carterizing wounds because of
[SPEAKER_01]: its flammability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, Dioscorides,
in about 65 AD, in the very first materia,
[SPEAKER_01]: Medica, introduced Agaricon, and recorded
it, but it was used long before that,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, as a highly active against
respiratory illnesses, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this gives you sort of the thread of
knowledge going back over the eons that
[SPEAKER_01]: the use of these mushrooms were actually,
and knowledge that were quite pervasive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always like to give credit to my
teachers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is Dr. Daniel Stuntz from the
University of Washington, Dr. Alexander
[SPEAKER_01]: Smith, from the University of Michigan,
Catherine Skates from Post Falls,
[SPEAKER_01]: Idaho, and Michael Beug from the Evergreen
State College.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was my direct professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: These three individuals have passed on,
and Michael Beug and I are still in
[SPEAKER_01]: contact with the song last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came into the field of mycology
rather young, when I was about 16 or 17
[SPEAKER_01]: years of age, my interest in mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was about 18, 19 years of age,
I was sort of adopted by these huge giants
[SPEAKER_01]: in the field of mycology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they took me out of the way,
all the more surprising, because Alexander
[SPEAKER_01]: Smith in particular, and Daniel Stuntz
were completely conservative individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I came on the scene in about 1975,
it was all the more surprising that they
[SPEAKER_01]: took a liking to me, because this is what
I looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your suspicions are now confirmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they saw that I had sincere interest
in fungi and, of course, in magic
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I had such an interest in
magic mushrooms in particular is because
[SPEAKER_01]: of my dear brother John, who unfortunately
passed away a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: John went down to Mexico, Columbia,
came back with these fantastic stories of
[SPEAKER_01]: eating salt-solid mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the youngest son, the youngest child
of my family of five.
[SPEAKER_01]: John was the oldest brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: But John was a serious scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew up in a small town in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a complete laboratory in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm talking three rows of chemicals,
on shelves, three shelf rows of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my father was a lieutenant in the
aircraft carrier Intrepid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after World War II, he got the
Intrepid aircraft carrier radio,
[SPEAKER_01]: the main radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had that in the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my brother would let me play in the
laboratory on the radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was listening to all these code
messages behind the iron curtain,
[SPEAKER_01]: strung these long, wavy antennas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just totally exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was this boy scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, oh, when I grow up,
I'm going to be a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have my own laboratory,
because my brother wouldn't let me play in
[SPEAKER_01]: a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So John went on to Yale.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brother Bill went on to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: My sister went on to Ohio State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had the laboratory to myself,
which I remember immediately looking up
[SPEAKER_01]: every experiment that said, danger,
do not bring near flame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a few of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that really imprinted me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm living my life's dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fortunate and gratified that I have a
wonderful company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 75 employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long road.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here today because of the generosity
and kindness of many people, including
[SPEAKER_01]: many people in this room, many of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have really been sort of imprinted by
this love of science and from my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to give a deep respect to my
brother John, who really first inspired
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is where I like to say we go to
church on Sundays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to go to the Old Ruth Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in a charismatic Christian
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: After my family sort of fell apart,
my mom became very religious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mother says, well, when are you
going to go to church?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, Mom, I go to the Old Ruth Forest all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, that's like playing the mic on
the church.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's look at the ecosystem of the
forest and to get a better understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a cross-section of the mixed
deciduous conifer forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are sapophytic fungi that break down
dead wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are the endophytic fungi that are
inside of trees and leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there's literally several hundred
species that have been identified
[SPEAKER_01]: endophytically and that are grown
beneficially to help the host defense of
[SPEAKER_01]: immunity of plants against infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of you know about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to give a shout out to Dr.
Suzanne Samard.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a hero of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a mycorrhizologist and a mycologist
here in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the parasitic fungi that
can kill weakened trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they oftentimes grow sapophytically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Jeff mentioned, the honey mushroom is
a parasite, and they can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: sapophytically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it wasn't until just recently that
scientists discovered that all plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: part fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I remember doing thin sectioning and
botany and looking under the microscope,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I see threads of fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my professor would say, oh,
they're infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's causing a disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now we know that they aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of these threads of fungi are part of
the community of fungi that gives the host
[SPEAKER_01]: organism the plant that are immune
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the consortium of those fungi really
make a huge difference in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now an excellent book I highly recommend
is Mycorrhizal Symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the little pine tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the root here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of this is the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the mycosphere around the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it literally extends the roots
hundreds, if not thousands of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are secreting sugars,
and they're benefiting the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fungi are then contributing
minerals that then help the plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it increases the moisture absorption
capability and the mineral uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: enormously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so science is so slow to catch up to
me, what I think is the obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a great experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only done in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this experiment kind of revolutionized
our understanding of the communication
[SPEAKER_01]: networks that Suzanne Simard and other
scientists are now talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what these scientists did is they had
five bean plants in separate pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the beans were growing up fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they exposed the first bean plant with
aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, immediately anti-apid alkaloids
uptick were coded and expressed by the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that was being attacked by aphids as
a protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are toxic alkaloids, the aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other four plants did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, they didn't have direct
contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they repeated the experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put all five plants in the same
common vessel of soil where the mycosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: of the mycelium then interconnected.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they exposed the first plant with
aphids, what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: All four other plants removed from contact
upregulated the anti-apid alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_01]: This then proved for the first time to
scientists that the mycelium actually is a
[SPEAKER_01]: communication pathway that is
communicating in order to protect the
[SPEAKER_01]: community of organisms within the
biosphere to be able to protect the
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was an astonishing
breakthrough in our understanding that
[SPEAKER_01]: these mycelium networks are actually
communication networks as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, mycelium can take many different
forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just some of the forms that I
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this next is a 10-day sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so often times, my time-lapse sequence
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the mycelium, rather,
I'll repeat to you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a lot of part of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have about 700 strains in culture of
mycelium, about over 500 species in our
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we mostly primary focus on sacrifice
because I'm naturally impatient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very interested in the sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we take wood primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: We add mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, we generate soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these sacrophytic fungi are the grand
molecular disassemblers of nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil magicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: They break down complex plant and animal
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they render it ultimately into soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way of decomposition then feeds
many other communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm involved in the permaculture
movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was at a Zeri conference in the Zeri
permaculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were wondering, how is it possible,
mushrooms growing in the desert?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have these mulch sheet piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then suddenly, all these mushrooms are
beginning to form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that they did not know,
if you take 100 kilos of sawdust,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance, up to 20 kilos of water will
be released out of 100 kilos of dry
[SPEAKER_01]: sawdust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mushroom mycelium generates water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it inhales oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's then breaking down linear cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It combines hydrogen and oxygen into H2O.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it generates its own water,
hydrating the habitats in advance of
[SPEAKER_01]: contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes sense because they're on
compost piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've seen little puddles of
water, that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a very interesting article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of monoculture, and I spent a lot
of time in the woods for three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in the wood products industry for
four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on the green chain pulling in a
sawmill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran caught up in a shingle mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in as a logger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, chokers begin with big and
slinger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three guys in my crew got killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wanted me to appoint me when I
was 21 years of age to the head of the
[SPEAKER_01]: crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I'm going back to college.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those three guys who died,
I mean, I depended upon them for my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They depended upon me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really got a feeling of deep
brotherhood and respect for the School of
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard Monks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a shout out to all those people who
have a great respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, because of monoculture,
slash and burn, planting trees,
[SPEAKER_01]: slash and burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we're harming the
biodiversity of the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we are seeing that we're getting
premature decline as soil lenses become
[SPEAKER_01]: thinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carbon is exported out of the
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very interesting that in healthy
soils, 70% of the soils are composed of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 30% of that soil mass is fungal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 21% approximately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Healthy soil is fungal cells, living or
dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how much fungizer is literally
under your feet on every step that you
[SPEAKER_01]: make on soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I spent many years as a scanning
electron microscopist.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some of my electron micrographs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the mushroom mycelium under an
electron microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to respond to poor environmental
stimuli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, introduction of rain, we've had lots
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's turning out to be a great mushroom
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have introduction of rain and water as
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have evaporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So drop in temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happens in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third is the mycelium then as it comes
up to the wet surface, it exhales carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: dioxide, inhales oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So exposure to oxygen is number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fourth one is quite surprising to
many people is light.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99% of all mushrooms require light before
the mycelium will produce a mushroom fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so light is critical for mushroom
formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the four primary stimuli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the fact that we exhale carbon
dioxide and fungi, too, speaks to our
[SPEAKER_01]: common evolutionary relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: 650 million years ago, we had a common
ancestor.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, a new super kingdom has been
created called Pisciconta that joined
[SPEAKER_01]: anamalia and fungi together.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that split, when we split from fungi,
the fungi went underground, externally
[SPEAKER_01]: digesting its nutrients outside its cell
walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chose the path of circulating our
nutrients in a cellular sac and then
[SPEAKER_01]: producing enzymes and digesting foods
within.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the split between
animals and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungi eat, digest our nutrients
externally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We digest our nutrients internally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the response to those four
environmental stimuli, then a mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: then suddenly emerges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a matter of four or five days,
it goes from this state here to this
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, mushrooms actually do not have a very
good immune system, most all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the fruit body is like a peach on
a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ripens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It attracts herbivores, us, and insects,
and animals to spread the pits,
[SPEAKER_01]: to spread the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mushrooms are no different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very, very protein and sugar rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they attract a lot of animals that can
help spread the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm fascinated with the decomposition
cycles of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the mushrooms then, as they begin
to decompose, for instance, it is a
[SPEAKER_01]: rushless piece in the overgrowth forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few days later, I come back,
and all sorts of the spores are
[SPEAKER_01]: germinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other fungi and lots of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole microbiome is evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a few days later, it goes
underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes subterranean.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a single inch of soil, it can be more
than a mile of these thin red threads of
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: My foot covers approximately 300 miles of
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the mycelium actually is resident
in the ecosystem for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycelium is the immune system of the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend Patrick Biggie made these
movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he made these macroscopic movies,
it really revolutionized our understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: about how these fungal networks work.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are bundles of nuclei that are
streaming through the mycelial networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And notice that they surge in clusters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as it turns out, the mycelium grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a swath of mycelium in the breadth of
my arms here can literally have billions
[SPEAKER_01]: of end branches that are constantly
forking.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the very, very tips, they become
polynucleate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many nuclei per cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later on, they'll just have two nuclei per
cell, as the mycelium gets old.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mycelium, you notice that all the
nuclei don't go in one direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are going backwards against
the cytoplasmic flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so think of at the end of the
branches, at the tips, there's hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: nuclei sometimes per cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just takes two nuclei to reassort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's a new insect, a new toxin,
a new piece of plants, a new piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: wood, and if they code for the enzyme that
can break down that new potential food
[SPEAKER_01]: resource, and then they can incorporate
it, what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycelium surges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then that genetic information becomes
encoded within the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only are these externalized
digestive membranes, not only are these
[SPEAKER_01]: externalized lungs, exhaling carbon
dioxide, inhaling oxygen, but these are
[SPEAKER_01]: learning networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are micro-neurological networks that
are constantly adapting to sudden change,
[SPEAKER_01]: to catastrophic, and they're able to
navigate and then learn and encode it
[SPEAKER_01]: within them, within their genetic memory,
their ability to have that information,
[SPEAKER_01]: to help them survive in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're up here in the BC zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the Columbia River.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I live near Olympia, Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to fly down here to the
John Day Wilderness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally hired an airplane and flew
down there to see the biggest organism in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mycelium at 2,200 acres in size,
1,665 football fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one cell at all thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now think of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have five or six skin layers that
protect you from infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycelium has one cell wall,
on the other side of which are hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of microbes per gram,
many of which are trying to consume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it possible that the largest
organism in the world only has one thin
[SPEAKER_01]: cell layer that protects it from
infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because there's a constant
biochemical communication with its
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's able to navigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's able to learn to adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, the largest organism in the
world is a honey mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I hired an airplane and I flew down
there once.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a small bush pilot, a cloth
airplane, covered airplane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went down there, and we couldn't find
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had the latitude, longitude from a
scientific article that was published on
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went back to Bowie Field,
and we looked at our maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next day, we flew back down there
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I flew up, and I flew down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still couldn't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a climate elevation,
a climate elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we spiraled up, spiraled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At 14,500 feet, we just came from sea
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told the pilot, I think I'm going to
faint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me get this photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took this photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the best photograph I think of the
largest organism in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would kill the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the port service would cut them
down because of lightning strikes because
[SPEAKER_01]: of fires.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is basically the honey mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the trees look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect for my hiking in the subalpine
regions of the Cascades and the Olympics,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if these mushrooms are actually
meadow makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually climax the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trees then die off, and meadows come
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the way of the ecosystem
during time out with ungulates and deer
[SPEAKER_01]: and elk come in, grays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a way of the ecosystem
reestablishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've always been confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would there be meadows when there's
all these forests?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the honey mushroom is actually
a meadow maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at the mycelium, it is
wonderfully articulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it forms these microcavenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microcavenes swell with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a mycelium habitat is a spongy
habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It holds water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps water in the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will have benefits to all sorts of
other members in the ecological community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And moreover, its integration and its
sophistication of networking allows it
[SPEAKER_01]: such that there's a break in a strand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's alternative pathways,
removing information, nuclei, cytoplasmic
[SPEAKER_01]: flow to the rest of the network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is one of the few organisms
that you can actually disturb and it
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits from that disturbance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mycelium is producing an extra cell
to metabolize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absorbing nutrients anywhere along
the entire surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in these metabolites, they have
antibacterial properties, antimicrobial
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have long believed and stated that I
believe they're deterministic in
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-selecting the microbial environment
that is essential for the plants to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give rise to the canopy that gives
them the green field that then feeds the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium resident within.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think these are deterministic in the
microbiomes they're selecting that then
[SPEAKER_01]: helps the plant communities thrive and
ultimately guarantees the progeny from
[SPEAKER_01]: these functional networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well coincident with the growth of these
fungi, I mentioned there are bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are rods of bacteria here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these rods, the bacterial communities
are controlled by the extra cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put together this chart just in the
past few days that you're about to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is grown on sterile substrates in our
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, the 200.0157 staphylococcus aureus.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is MRSA, M-R-S-A, the Methicillin
Business Strange Staphylococcus aureus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chose about 12 species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a 10 to the eighth power,
a little bit higher than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to the eighth power is more than 100
million colonies in a millimeter of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: One gram is one millimeter of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the starting is the FDA laboratory and
then we challenge it with one milliliter
[SPEAKER_01]: of these extra cellular droplets from the
mycelium with one milliliter of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial enriched water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 24 to 72 hours, it went from 100
million colonies down to 10 to the third
[SPEAKER_01]: power and then 10 to the second power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it went from 100 million colonies to
100,001 reduction to 1,000 to 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: A remarkable drop in pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the first time this has ever
been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to show that grown on
sterile substrates that the mycelium from
[SPEAKER_01]: the wild would carry forward these
antimicrobial defenses because we share in
[SPEAKER_01]: common many of the same pathogens that
harm us, also harm fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So candida, staphylococcus, E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli are pathogens to fungi as well as
pathogens to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can take advantage of the
antimicrobial host defense immunity of
[SPEAKER_01]: these fungi in order to protect us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have about 38 YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really encourage you to look at this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have time to show it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we developed this submerged
fermentation method where we just take
[SPEAKER_01]: wood chips and put it in water for two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do this with straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can use it with salt water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't stir it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets a bacterial slime on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the microbial population changes from
anaerobic bacteria to anaerobic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just let it sit for a long
time, for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we drain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we drain it, oxygen becomes a
sterilizer against the anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can inoculate with mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mycelium runs like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gobbles up the anaerobe, which is now
asphyxiating because of the high oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's great YouTube videos I have up
there to show you how to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so I said, OK, I have a common
batch of wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me inoculate the same batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put in the garden giant in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put urbex lacteus, which is a
crusted polypore that's very important in
[SPEAKER_01]: fire remediation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I put them in the same wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did what's called next-gen
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wonderful thing about being in
charge of my own company and having to
[SPEAKER_01]: control the bank now is I can spend money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I spent thousands of dollars on
this chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found a thousandfold difference in
the relative abundance across 500 species
of wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria that were selected out by the
garden giant mushroom versus the crusted
[SPEAKER_01]: polypore.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time this has ever been shown is
that the microbiome in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this case in the wood chips,
was controlled by the antibiotic profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: of the species that we were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an example of healthy,
happy mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This strand of mycelium here, I weighed
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one centimeter compared to what this
weight was, the difference was 30,000 to
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one centimeter length of mycelium held
30,000 times its mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mycelium grows through a habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also tenacious and holds it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the mycelium runs, is what I like
about my book called Mycelium Running
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where it's multi-nucleate on the
very tips of running edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mycelium are edge runners.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love to run along the edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is what we want to see as
cultivators, as rapidly the core beans
[SPEAKER_01]: diverging mycelium networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're constantly on the move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're producing all sorts of
enzymes, lactases in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are able to break down cellulose and
lignin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the Old Growth Forest,
which is a treasure trove, a genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: treasure that's so important that we
preserve, especially in the Northwest
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go to the Old Growth Forest and this is
a place that is very spiritually important
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had many, many experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was involved in cutting the Old
Growth Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's karmic payback for me to give back
to the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And considering that, I was involved in
its decimation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being a manly man, I am very focused on
decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I see these logs and these trees
laying down in the ecosystem, I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: watch them over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a log like this will totally decompose
in about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just be duff in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the most primary medicinal
mushrooms in the world is a woodland
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom called turkey tail, Trumadys
versicolor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corioles versicolor is the old name
retired decades ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the most well-studied
medicinal mushroom in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We applied for an NIH grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was a co-investigator, co-PI is
called, principal investigator,
[SPEAKER_01]: helped write the grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And NIH, the National Institute of Health
in the United States, awarded us $2.2
[SPEAKER_01]: million for breast cancer clinical study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So turkey tail was really indicated in
Asia as being very, very helpful for the
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we applied for this grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's been very excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul, you're a mycologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did we get our mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, oh, please get them from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mushrooms hyperaccumulate toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mushrooms from China are notoriously
toxic with all sorts of pollutants and
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, the chain of custody is really
critically important if you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduce these experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, well, you can't be a principal
investigator and a supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So choose one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I became a supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were put into a jury of five other
suppliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully, we were chosen to be number
one as a sole source supplier on the first
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical study, breast cancer clinical
study, using the results of the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we fast forward and the results of the
study show a statistically significant,
[SPEAKER_01]: highly significant increase in CD8
cytotoxic T cells, one of your front line
[SPEAKER_01]: defenses, and natural killer cells on a
dose-dependent basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So prior pre-radiation, your native killer
cell community is relatively stable and
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post-radiation, it declines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of you know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your immune system is impaired by
radiation therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two weeks later, on a dose-dependent
basis, the immune system is enhanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how much of the turkey tail
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've compared fruit bodies and
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycelium was far more active than the
fruit bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were real excited about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was published.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got a lot of other oncologists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked with a lot of oncologists and
medical researchers on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the breast cancer clinical study
was progressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had an internal tragedy in our
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is best for this short
little TED Med video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So address this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another mushroom empowers the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is turkey tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: This hit home to me very personally in
June of 2009, when my 84-year-old mother
[SPEAKER_01]: called me up and said, Paul, I have
something very serious to talk to you
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're always so busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a terrible thing to hear from Mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Mom, what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's a very happy, genuine person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she goes, I'm worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mother is deeply religious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not seen a doctor since 1968.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, my right breast is five times
the size of my left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had six swollen lymph glands the size of
walnuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her voice started shaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not ashamed to admit that I
started crying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't you tell me sooner?
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent a large part of June at the
Swedish Breast Cancer Clinic in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The oncologist examined her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And upon the second examination,
she had a 5.5 centimeter diameter tumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had metastasized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to her sternum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to her liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had stage four breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor gave her less than three months
to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, it was the second worst case of
breast cancer she had seen as a doctor in
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years of practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the circle family meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe we've gone through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom announced that she bought a pine
casket, the cheapest one that she could
[SPEAKER_01]: find, because she was going to heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the doctor said, you know,
you're too old to have her eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: In radiation therapy, you can't have your
breasts removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's an interesting study on turkey
tail mushrooms at the Steer Medical
[SPEAKER_01]: School.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to try taking those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my buddy goes, well, my son's
supplying those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she was put on Tapsol and Herceptin,
wonderful drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she started taking eight turkey
tail capsules a day, four in the morning
[SPEAKER_01]: and four in the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in June of 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, my mother has no detectable
tumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's my wonderful mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when she passed the five-year
disease-free survival rate, which doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like to use the word cure,
but there's no evidence of disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: We common people will say cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the message my mother left on
my voicemail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my mother now is 91 years of age.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's cancer-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's sharp as a tack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she just beat recently my two brothers
in Scrabble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then my mother was written up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a best-case outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an international journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They interviewed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They interviewed Julie Smith, her
oncologist, a Swedish breast cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And throughout these interviews,
it was very interesting because several
[SPEAKER_01]: things came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Julie Smith recommended turkey tail
mushrooms in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my mother lives in Winthrop,
Washington at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she started her septum program in
Ellensburg, Washington, over the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she goes, well, should I tell my new
oncologist I'm taking turkey tail
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, no, please don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The oncologist had an abundance of caution
that the non-experienced, Julie Smith,
[SPEAKER_01]: the oncologist, the Swedish breast cancer
was up a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the doctors will say, no,
stop taking everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So upon interviewing Julie Smith and my
mother, we believe this was a
[SPEAKER_01]: life-and-death decision that she did not
tell her oncologist that she was telling,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking turkey tail mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: She ended her septum program, 50 women
dead, 48 women have died in that program
[SPEAKER_01]: after five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother and one other lady are the only
two known survivors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This led in also then to a subsequent
study that found that PSKs in turkey tail
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms and that the turkey tail
mushroom constituents had helped her
[SPEAKER_01]: septum work better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great example of conventional
therapy working with natural medicine in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to potentiate a good recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is something I really want folks
to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an extraction chart, basically
using different solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna see this three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hot water is a great, it's a polar
solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pulls out proteins, lipoproteins,
and polysaccharides.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of you know that lipids are not
soluble, and oils are not soluble in
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they use the least water-loving
non-polar solvents, hexanes, petanethers,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you do hot water extraction,
you partition away all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of them are left behind
because they're not water-soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm involved in these group of
physicians, you know, who are
[SPEAKER_01]: literature-driven, and so am I.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I said, I can't figure out what PSK
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a molecular complex, but there's no
molecular signature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's the HPLC that we can use
for PSK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is none.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I hammered these medical
researchers, and finally, I think I got
[SPEAKER_01]: through the noise, and I'm extraordinarily
happy with this recent article that came
[SPEAKER_01]: out by some of the co-authors in the
breast cancer clinical study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found that PSK, and they found
that it's not a pure compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a molecular complex of great
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they used lipases that dissolved
the lipids away from the giant scalpel of
[SPEAKER_01]: the beta-glucan complex, it denatured the
immune benefit of PSK by 83%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it turns out that beta-glucan is a
wonderful, there's this huge molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: complex, tons of literature, but until
this time, no one had used these enzymes
[SPEAKER_01]: that would take away the lipids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this huge molecular complex is a,
you know, beta-glucan is going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: million in terms of, a million dolmens in
terms of its molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a giant scalpel being embedded
into which are all these other active
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this showed that if you didn't have the
lipids in the beta-glucan, then you lost
[SPEAKER_01]: the immune benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then we go forward, and then an
extraordinary double-blind
[SPEAKER_01]: placebo-controlled study here that showed
that turkey tail enhances the microbiome,
[SPEAKER_01]: helping lactobacillus and bifidobacterium,
beneficial bacteria in the GI tract,
[SPEAKER_01]: suppressing inflammatory staphylococcus,
clostridium, and enterococcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it modifies the fecal microbiota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the mushrooms, they're like,
oh my gosh, it's just like an ecosystem of
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They set the stage of the beneficial
bacteria getting health to their members
[SPEAKER_01]: and their ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, these fungi, as you consume them
internally, also affect the bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: flora in your gut and to your benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why when I meet people who say,
I can't stomach mushrooms, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually giving you a very important
scientific observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their microbiome is mismatched to the
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is why I think some people
can't tolerate digestive mushrooms instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of incompatibility and bacterial
microflora in their gut versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the species that I mentioned before,
agaricon, probably top-notch fish
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis, the longest-living mushroom in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I received a National Geographic Award
for my work inside of the Old Growth
[SPEAKER_01]: Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wanted to do a story on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they sent a photojournalist from New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before he came out, he says,
Paul, we want to do a search for the
[SPEAKER_01]: agaricon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's perfectly from that geo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from the Old Growth Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't want you to take us to a
place that you already know an agaricon
[SPEAKER_01]: exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have that Eureka experience of
discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, now, how likely can we find
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally lied.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so rare to find a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one out of 100 trips in the Old
Growth Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dear professor, Dr. Michael Bue,
45 years hunting in the Old Growth Forest,
[SPEAKER_01]: found this first agaricon last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes to the Old Growth Forest all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He finally found one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how rare it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, oh, 50-50, but my answer to the
photojournalist was, I didn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: National Geographic to cancel a story on
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had 10 reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought 10 of my friends with
high-powered binoculars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rented a motor sailor here,
Cortez Island, with a zodiac.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is we've got the inland
passage, the desolation sound,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of Old Growth Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked for snags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often times, it looked like a giant
beehive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often, the bald eagles are on these
snags that agaricon grows in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had 10 people with high-powered
binoculars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going up the desolation sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a tree, snag, nothing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tree, nothing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tree, nothing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do that for three hours, four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got red in the burn, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the photojournalist started to be
upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, did you promise me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, 50-50 is like fishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're from New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our skipper said, listen, it's
lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were out for hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go over to a first-people site.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first-people site is not really clear
what the pictographs mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met a number of first peoples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did wage, white people did wage
bioterrorism against indigenous people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purposely or by accident, but
nevertheless, tuberculosis, flu viruses,
[SPEAKER_01]: and pox viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend, Gujjala, who's the
president of the Haida people,
[SPEAKER_01]: he said, Paul, you think us Indians know
everything about ethnobotany,
[SPEAKER_01]: ethnomycology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we knew a lot more before we had
these pandemics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have six pandemics come
within 60 years, wiping out 75% to 95% of
[SPEAKER_01]: the indigenous people, it's an oral
tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get disconnected from our ancestral
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyhow, we motor over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a great place, a 30-foot
overhang.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we motor over there to have lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of my teammates goes,
there's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Found one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right at a first-people site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one's especially unusual because
it's growing underneath this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It teeter-tottered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the mycelium re-grew from the
mushroom back into the branch and
[SPEAKER_01]: connected with the mycelium in the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it grew two legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extraordinarily interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you look at the origination
myth of women who are the Haida people,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is an argillite played from Charles
Evans Shaw in 1894.
[SPEAKER_01]: This speaks to the origination myth of
women, the Haida.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was Raven paddling on a canoe in
the Sea of Eternity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Raven seeks help for the bear,
the killer whale, the bald eagle.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the other animals in the ecosystem
can help Raven steer her canoe to find her
[SPEAKER_01]: genitalia except for fungus man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this creature here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that grave guardians that
were carved from a garakon were placed on
[SPEAKER_01]: the first-people shaman's grave to help
protect them to go into the afterlife.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were bombed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chicago Field Museum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were repatriated, thankfully,
back to the first peoples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they analyzed these, they were
not made of wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were made of a garakon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were carved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as it turns out, there's two
potential candidates for the oarsman that
[SPEAKER_01]: helped Raven.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a garakon, but there's also the
artist-kong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the artist-kong may have been this
fungus, also not a garakon, even though we
[SPEAKER_01]: know the grave guardians were carved from
a garakon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why artist-kong may have
been the one is that you can draw a map.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually draw on this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a graphical point of view,
you want to associate and you just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have to look at the oars and the
channels and pass the islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually draw on the wood-kong a
map.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of makes sense, also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so we're there at the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a fungus man-like pictograph
with salmon eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Dr. Scott Transbaum.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the director of the Tuberculosis
Research Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was very interested in ethnomycology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote an article on a garakon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He contacted me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I'm funded by the Gates
Foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very concerned about XDR-TV,
multi-token diseases, strains of
[SPEAKER_01]: tuberculosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I'd like to, you know,
go with you, Paul, and explore it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we invited him, and he went with us to
this site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we take these tubes here,
but we just need a small piece of tissue.
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked with Scott Transbaum and the
UIC, Tuberculosis Research Division,
[SPEAKER_01]: for five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did solvent extractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used the most polar water, the least
polar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is called biogadded
fractionation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you refractionate a natural substance,
and you go down the decision tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polar, nonpolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You test those post-loss fractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did increased activity was found in one
fraction against tuberculosis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and less in the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course there would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you follow the path that has the most
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you keep on fractionating,
fractionating, fractionating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each fraction takes weeks, months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very laborious process.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how the pharmaceutical industry
discovers active constituents,
[SPEAKER_01]: new drugs, from nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after five years, lo and behold,
Scott and our team, we discovered two
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorinated coumarins from a garrikon,
highly active against tuberculosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we actually found active new drugs
that are resident in this mushroom that
[SPEAKER_01]: was celebrated by the Greeks, celebrated
by the Haida and the First Coast peoples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go back now, five at the time we
were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were there, and we're exploring
there for several hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm such an idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm there, and I see this rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see this rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that rock is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of looks like a garrikon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a garrikon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a garrikon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how likely is it we'd find a garrikon?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: One in 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: How likely is it we'd find where the
pictographs are really reminiscent of
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus men helping hide a raven found on
the sea of eternity?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: One in 10,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: One in 100,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: How likely is it we'd find a rock that
looks really suspicious?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's been carved in the shape of a
garrikon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one in a million.
[SPEAKER_01]: How likely is it we'd find it on my
birthday?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is when the photojournalist
started shaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went, does this happen to Paul often?
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to look at him deadpan and said,
yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, I think, speaks to a higher
truth and a core of my belief.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you walk with faith in nature,
with respect of indigenous peoples,
[SPEAKER_01]: respect of your ancestors, and the
obligation to your descendants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you walk with truthfulness not
motivated by money, but inspired by
[SPEAKER_01]: science and discovery and sharing,
then I believe nature will reward you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what I believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a garrikon is really hard to find,
but we have now 70 strains of a garrikon,
[SPEAKER_01]: by far the largest library of a garrikon
in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we have to go up trees,
a 700-year-old tree on Cortez Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what the garrikon,
the branch, is hard as a rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't rock the branch that
supports it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this one's about 70 years of age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes through a metamorphosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I brought both of these specimens
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes through a white form,
the ghost form, as it's known.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this mushroom changes into this
white form as it lays in the Old Booth
[SPEAKER_01]: Forest, subjected to rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we get our cultures from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we thought that was the biggest one
in the world, but until we saw this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is from Northern California,
a typical NorCal kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one's about 120 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over 100 years of age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a forest that was going to be
cut down and slash and burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the people called us up saying,
hey, it's a very large gopher,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: But please send us specimens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send us a giant chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got this one in the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The forest was cut down and burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saved this phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saved the strain of agarikon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have it in culture today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we typically go out to the Old Booth
Forest with a GPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take a stainless steel tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: We leave the agarikon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only need that amount of tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get it in the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we compare strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: These strains are different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a ridge of incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the same strain that grow together
seamlessly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a way of our testing different
phenotypes in the same forest to see how
[SPEAKER_01]: many different varieties we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've been fascinated with my
antimicrobial properties of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I published an article in Herbal
Ground in June of 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it summarized in one page all the
information in scientific literature on
[SPEAKER_01]: the antiviral compounds and properties of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's a lot of one page long,
but less than one page.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's two big photographs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got about six or seven
references.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all there was in scientific
literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was in June of 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: I published this and made the cover of
Herbal Ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 9-11 occurs several months later,
three months later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 9-11 occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the biggest concern very quickly
became weaponized viruses, in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: smallpox.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a physician with the Department of
Defense, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioshield Biodefense Program got ahold of
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, oh, I saw this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very concerned about bioterrorism.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know you have a large library of
old-growth fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you submit some of your samples for
the Bioshield Biodefense Program,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was organized by NIH, NIAD,
and U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: AMRAD, U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Army Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a huge honor to get ahold of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started sending in mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sent in hot water extracts of rachia,
artis conch, and agaricon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sent water extracts of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did ethanol extracts of
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this went on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had sent our first 80 samples out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I waited a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my managers called me up and said,
Paul, there's a helicopter over the
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, no, baby, there's no helicopter in
the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, well, and he goes,
no, Paul, it's really close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, how close?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, what's the numbers on the tail of
the helicopter?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, there are no numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Black Hawk helicopter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that same week, what happened is
that Federal Express delivered us all
[SPEAKER_01]: these research results from the BioShield
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm flipping through them,
no activity, no activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a sample 78, highly active against
pox viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I come to another sample,
highly active against pox viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had three hits against pox viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't tell the government what they
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I coded them in a notebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked up the codes, and they were
all agaricon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was appointed, one person in the
BioShield program was my manager,
[SPEAKER_01]: my contact, Dr. Huggins, he's a physician.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I called up Dr. Huggins and said,
this is research results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was extraordinarily excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, what research results?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, Federal Express just delivered me
all these research results, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: testing all of our extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, you're not supposed to get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll photocopy and send them to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so disorganized, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the helicopter shows up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I told my employees, okay, shut down
the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give the employees copies of the cultures
that had activity against pox viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever tell me who has them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut down the business right now and leave
with a helicopter over the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did, 11 vehicles separated from the
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later on, I got security clearance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We choked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told the transporter, why didn't you
guys interact together?
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, oh my god, if you only knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was fine, but they said,
you know, just the right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You decentralized yourself as a target.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we advanced forward, and you can all
look this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an interview with the BioShield
program, the deputy director of the FDA,
[SPEAKER_01]: and myself, on National Public Radio,
Google Stamets and Smallpox, NPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a better press release from
the US Department of Defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says that the top 10 samples of more
than 200,000 specimens, it was over two
[SPEAKER_01]: million, and we were the only natural
product that had high activity against pox
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones were pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, now we go forward, and we do
bio-guided fractionation again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time, we do it at the University of
Mississippi School of Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing as before, you know,
polar solver, you know, water,
[SPEAKER_01]: non-polar, you know, hexane, and we
fractionate it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after about seven years, lo and
behold, we find two active molecules,
[SPEAKER_01]: highly active against pox viruses,
more potent than Sinovavir, the preeminent
[SPEAKER_01]: positive anti-drug control, with less side
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, sulfuric acid turns out to be
highly active against pox viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, most, you know, smallpox,
you know, cowpox is out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: camelpox, et cetera, but smallpox
supposedly didn't have any natural
[SPEAKER_01]: reserves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know in Russia and the United States,
and two or three other countries,
[SPEAKER_01]: they do have smallpox in culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, those of you who are not
immunized, I think it's about 1968,
[SPEAKER_01]: they stopped immunizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of us, you know, who were in school
at the time, had a smallpox vaccination
[SPEAKER_01]: scar on our arms, typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, most of you are
immunologically naive, which means you're
[SPEAKER_01]: highly susceptible to smallpox.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first people, in particular,
were super sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 90% of those First Nations people,
in fact, had died.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, a European and African background,
30% will die, 30% will become blind,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30% are highly scarred, and recover,
and 10% will be immune.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyhow, so we were quite great with
nonactive molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, very quickly, the virus of
concern became flu viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's been several pandemics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all know about Spanish flu in 1918,
and then different flu pandemics that H5N1
[SPEAKER_01]: became the bureau of big virus of concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a poultry virus, this passed two
years ago, H7N9, hit Minnesota and Iowa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Millions and millions of birds were then
euthanized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, an organic chicken owner,
who I helped her family out with a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: crisis, contacted me and said,
Paul, we're killing all these chickens,
[SPEAKER_01]: and can you help, you know, we know about
your research, you know, can you help
[SPEAKER_01]: these chickens?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sent back 50 kilos of agaricon
mycelium grown on rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They benefited 20,000 chickens,
and those chickens became an oasis of
[SPEAKER_01]: immunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not get the bird flu,
and so they did not have to be euthanized.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the other poultry in the surrounding
counties were euthanized, and this was a
[SPEAKER_01]: stark contrast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the reason being is that this is
the, from the BioShield BioDefense
[SPEAKER_01]: Program, by the time of an anthropologist,
it's called the seed activity index.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that's two is active,
anything that's 10 is highly active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is a summary of our anti-flu
research results for the BioShield
[SPEAKER_01]: BioDefense Program, and ribovirin is a
preeminent drug control, anti-biological
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see anything over 10 is active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is, you know, 32, 170,
45.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is our agaricon mycelium,
our reishi mycelium, our chagla mycelium,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it did a blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we gave them, we knew that the
ethanol extracts of mycelium, grown on
[SPEAKER_01]: rice, by the way, were highly active
against pox viruses, so we sent those
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the extracts are in 35% ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the very, basically, it's the
simplest extract you have that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: received.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on your seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are in-vitro human cell assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't put 35% ethanol extract on a
human cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they polluted it 10 to 1 to 3.5,
10 to 1 again, to 0.35.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 100 to 1 dilution of our extracts,
and this is the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenomenally, more potent, as a natural
extract diluted 100 to 1 compared to a
[SPEAKER_01]: pure anti-viral molecule, we beat the
pants of the ribovirin, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of all three of these ended up
having an extraordinarily high activity
[SPEAKER_01]: against H5N1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, I got very excited about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is back in 2005, and I filed a
patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, my discovery,
and spent all this money, so I filed a
[SPEAKER_01]: patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the patent disappears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the patent never gets published.
[SPEAKER_01]: The applications are published within a
year or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the USPTO.gov homepage, the US Patent
and Trademark Office homepage,
[SPEAKER_01]: the patent didn't even get published.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get all my patent turning,
going, where's my frigging patent?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we contacted the Patent Office,
and the Department of Defense took the
[SPEAKER_01]: patent out of the Patent Office because of
national security.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same reason that you can't buy the
patent about making a nuclear weapon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give a terrorist a blueprint for
making a nuclear weapon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to do an intergovernmental
agency trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: After four or five years, we pulled the
patent back from the US Defense
[SPEAKER_01]: Department.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into the Patent Office,
and then we got the strangest rejection of
[SPEAKER_01]: all time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, somebody talking to the patent
examiner?
[SPEAKER_01]: The patent rejection made no sense at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to the Board of Appeals,
unanimity of opinion, 10 examiners that
[SPEAKER_01]: approved the patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was then published in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: Begarikon, active against the flu virus,
and active against staph and E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, as well as herpes and pox viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now to have a medicinal mushroom that's
active against viruses and bacteria is
[SPEAKER_01]: really significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people who die from flu viruses die
from bacterial pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their immune system's challenged by the
flu virus, and then they have their immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system depressed, and the bacteria start
growing in their lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They die from respiratory bacterial
pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to have something that's duly active is
significantly significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so we did this, and then the Vector
Institute in Russia, they came out with an
[SPEAKER_01]: article in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: I discovered this in 2005, but it was very
nice, because the Vector Institute,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Fort Dutrake, it's the top secret
bioterrorism, and they have smallpox
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also found that lumped in one of
Begarikon, it's active against pox
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of good, because they
validated what I discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave a talk in Washington, DC,
and a whole bunch of people from Fort
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutrake, they knew my research,
and the BioShield program, so I invited
[SPEAKER_01]: them to go to my talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed them this, and I said,
we beat the Russians by seven years in a
[SPEAKER_01]: small cheer, went up in the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another group of scientists then
also found the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was good, we had multiple
validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this story now starts to take
some strange twists and turns.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article just came out recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that Tamiflu is dependent
upon the supply chain of the star anise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Star anise produces shekemic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shekemic acid, you know, Tamiflu is an
antiviral against blue viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that blue light stimulates
the mycelium of oyster mushrooms to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce shekemic acid 24-7.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine supply chains of star anise
coming from Afghanistan are rather
[SPEAKER_01]: strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of the Tamiflu shortage,
because they couldn't get a star anise to
[SPEAKER_01]: make Tamiflu, now we know that oyster
mushroom mycelium, under blue light
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulation, produces antiviral
precursors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go forward, and this is the quote,
we go to lots of reishi, we go to fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies, we go to mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have very large laboratories,
it's a beautiful antiform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have been espousing because I'm a
mycologist with a strong emphasis on
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems and understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been saying for a long time,
the mushrooms are the end of the life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the challenges of the mycelium
are much greater than that of the mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit body.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to navigate through a microbial
and hostile environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: One cell wall thick, lots of microbes on
their side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sure enough, our complete genome
sequencing of reishi mushroom shows that
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium codes for many more compounds
than the mushrooms do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because they're coding these more
compounds, they're extracellular
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites that we have been focusing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we then were able, we've kind of been
ahead of a curve here, and then science
[SPEAKER_01]: then validates a lot of our premises.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is chaga.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chaga was on birch trees and bee trees,
sometimes on chestnuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, chaga is being cut off
by the thousands, and it's a wild west
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting of chaga, and it's starting the
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unbeknownst to us, a group of
physicians in the United Kingdom,
[SPEAKER_01]: cut some of our chaga extract with IBD
patients and found that the mycelium grown
[SPEAKER_01]: on rice protected DNA damage more than
55%, highly significant against DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidative stress damage using the chaga
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I think is a very good argument that
we should grow the mycelium in the
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory, it's sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for your family and your
friends, I don't have an issue with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when people go out collecting hundreds
of pounds of chaga, which was widely
[SPEAKER_01]: available a few years ago, now you can
barely get 10 kilos, if you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the chaga here is the roads and
trails have been chopped off, and it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, all of this now has been a storyline
that comes up to an equation that's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: lead to a paradigm shifting solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I call this micro factor number one,
F of A, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, antivirals and antioxidants and
polyper mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna create a micro factorial
equation that's gonna lead to a paradigm
[SPEAKER_01]: solution that is gonna hopefully save
hundreds of millions of lives and
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity of this planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are, I didn't know what to call
them, they're experiences, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I slung these together, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's micro factor one, we'll call it
A, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: F of A for you math people out there,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next experience, I'm growing the
garden giant mushroom in my garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is 1984, and I go out to my
garden, and there's my garden giant
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom, and I look at it really closely
and I go, this is so bizarre.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these bees on my wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: They move the wood chips to the side,
I look at them very carefully,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're sipping on the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's little droplets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They uncover the mycelium that's hidden by
the wood chips, and it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's a huge amount of weight
there, and for 40 days from dawn to dusk,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a continuous convoy of bees from
my bee hives that are going to my garden
[SPEAKER_01]: giant patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: My patch was about eight, 10 inches thick,
and it shrunk to about two inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And strangely, the garden giant mushroom
is called the burgundy mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are burgundy red, like burgundy wine,
and these mushrooms are white.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, this is so strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I published this, I mentioned it,
and Harris Smith Magazine, 1988,
[SPEAKER_01]: was published.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in one of my books, Growing
Bermuda Dice and Mushrooms in 1994.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody basically ignored me,
and I called this micro factor number two,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: F of B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, did this all make sense to you,
and why?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a series of strange experiences in
my life ever since I was a child,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to the present day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hiking in the Old Boath Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'd like to love to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bears scratch trees, and the Forest
Service and Timber Industry put a bounty
[SPEAKER_01]: on bears to kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Skookum Inlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's massive salmon runs coming right
in front of my place, and there's no bears
[SPEAKER_01]: at all because the hunters killed the
bears on a bounty because bears are
[SPEAKER_01]: scratching the trees, and when they
scratch the trees, they introduce fungus,
[SPEAKER_01]: the polypore mushroom, in particular,
the red belted polypore that I held up at
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bears scratch trees, then resins
ooze out, and bees use the resins to make
[SPEAKER_01]: propolis to seal the cracks in their hives
and for anti-microbial protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hiking in the South Fork of the
Hode River in the Olympic Mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to orient here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go on trail, and I see this bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best bear scratch photograph
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take this photograph, and you know,
a bear went up this tree and went bam!
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I'm there with my wife,
Dusty, and I said, you know, the Forest
[SPEAKER_01]: and Timber Industry killed the bears
because of these bear scratches.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said the red belted polypore is a
parasitic fungus because of the scratch,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it hurts their bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's kill all the bears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humans are so good at choosing opposites
for their best interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it turns out that a park here in
British Columbia found that bears bring
[SPEAKER_01]: salmon carcasses up out of the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The salmon are bringing sea phosphorus and
other minerals, and by scavenging animals
[SPEAKER_01]: of wolves, coyotes, bald eagles,
etc., ravens, they spread the phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: in the forest to help the forest grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can go back two years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a long time to find this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hours and hours of pouring rain,
and we find the exact tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years later, and lo and behold,
I got the red belted polypore,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different tree, but there's a scar
also, but this is what the red belted
[SPEAKER_01]: polypore looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was growing out of the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the red belted polypore also creates
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very active in microremediation,
breaking down toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found this to be really interesting
because I was working with it already,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I connected the dots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bear scratch trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red belted polypore comes out of its
tree scratches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is microfactor number three,
F of C.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friend Louis Schwarzberg is a
natural geographic and Walt Disney,
[SPEAKER_01]: slow-mo, fast-mo photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew of my work with entomopathogenic
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seven patents now on using fungi to
control termites, mosquitoes, carpenter
[SPEAKER_01]: ants, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, Paul, do you know about colony
collapse with bees?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's horrible, and this is a viral mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been interviewing these bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started researching about bees,
and then President Obama came out with
[SPEAKER_01]: this memorandum, and bees are on multiple
stressors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a confluence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perfect storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these stressors are coefficients in a
formula, the end of which is causing the
[SPEAKER_01]: bees to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's bee nutrition, lack of
foraging lands, there's parasites,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mites in particular, the vector
viruses, and the co-occurrence of
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide exposure, and insecticides,
etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the use of now neonicotinoids,
neonicosis as they're known, harming the
[SPEAKER_01]: drone's sperm vitality and limiting their
lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's a perfect storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this sort of started coming at me,
and then in Whole Foods, thank you Whole
[SPEAKER_01]: Foods for this bottle wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your dairy selection with bees,
and if we had no bees, this is what your
[SPEAKER_01]: dairy selection would look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Stephanie presented her food as
indirectly and directly dependent upon bee
[SPEAKER_01]: pulmination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the New York Times came out with
an article, and this has been all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: news for the past several years,
that the decline of the pollination of the
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces by bees and bats and other
insects is a threat to global food
[SPEAKER_01]: biosecurity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm laying in bed, and I love the
space, the ether space between sleeping
[SPEAKER_01]: and dreaming and wakefulness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that to be a really creative
view to engage now and spend some extra
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm writing this book on medicinal
mushrooms, I'm working with the BioShield
[SPEAKER_01]: BioDefense Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have all these patents on working with
controlling insects, and it's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all over the Bible about 10 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you have seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul Stannis can take down Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have a very disruptive technology
that we're launching in January that will
[SPEAKER_01]: be a big threat to Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I have this epiphany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went, oh my God, I think I know how
to help the bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be able to save the bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had this epiphany, and I put these
thoughts together, and at TED,
[SPEAKER_01]: I called the University of California,
Davis, and tried to explain the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: the people got blurry eye or ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called Steve Sheppard, I said,
Steve, just give me a few minutes to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after explaining for a few minutes,
Steve said, stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington State University, I'm the chair
of entomology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're interested in doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to show you now a five minute
movie that's aired on hundreds of PBS
[SPEAKER_01]: stations that summarizes the initial
research that Steve and I were doing with
[SPEAKER_01]: our teammates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: These girls are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making baby bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric Wilson owns more colonies than any
beekeeper in Washington State.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing greater than open
bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just months ago, he opened the tides
and discovered nearly half his bees were
[SPEAKER_02]: dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent 20 years as a pilot in the Air
Force.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my
[SPEAKER_04]: bees were dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the lowest time of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out this may be the new normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The US Department of Agriculture said that
nearly half of colonies across the country
[SPEAKER_02]: died in the 2014 season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big losses have been happening for years,
and scientists haven't pinpointed what's
[SPEAKER_02]: causing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say more than 60 factors may play a
role in collapsing colonies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Factors like pesticides, malnutrition,
and loss of habitat.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't find some answers,
I am really concerned about whether these
[SPEAKER_04]: little girls will survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one unlikely solution may be growing
close by in the forests of Western
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enter Paul Stamets.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a pioneer in the study of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a beautiful specimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white margin here means it's growing
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes me a happy person too.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother was much happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stamets gathers the forest for rare types
of fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use mycology to use a fungi to help
clean up the environment and improve the
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system of animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I began to think, we've gone to the
moon, we've gone to Mars.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about the bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stamets recently discovered a mushroom
that might be able to take on one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: honeybee's worst enemies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's called the Varroa mite,
with the name Varroa Destructor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Varroa mites began wreaking havoc on USB
hives in 1996.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost about half the colonies east of
the Mississippi over that winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Shepard is an entomologist at
Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_02]: He spent decades trying to understand how
Varroa mites crippled honeybees.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says they invade hives and attach
themselves to infant bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always think of it as having something
about the size of a pancake feeding on
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They rip off bee blood and transmit a slew
of viruses to their hosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some sickly bees lose the ability to fly
and gather food for the hive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many end up dying prematurely.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll kill the colony within a couple of
years unless beekeepers intervene.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Shepard decided to try and
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: He teamed up with Paul Stamets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stamets told him about a type of fungus
that's highly attractive and highly lethal
[SPEAKER_02]: to termites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shepard wondered what this termite-killing
mushroom extract would do to the Varroa
[SPEAKER_02]: mite.
[SPEAKER_02]: He recently started testing the product on
bees in his lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not all that mushrooms can do
for bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bees have immune systems just like we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these mushrooms, they're like
miniature pharmaceutical factories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their initial results show that certain
forest mushrooms can reduce viruses in
[SPEAKER_02]: bees and help them live longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shepard and Stamets plan to expand both
experiments by partnering with commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: beekeepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric Olson was the first to sign up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have too much hair left.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have pulled my hair out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just can't seem to get a control on the
Varroa mite.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got our fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The future of western honeybee colonies
and the billions of dollars of crops they
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinate may depend on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most beekeepers will tell you that the
Varroa mite, Varroa destructor,
[SPEAKER_01]: is really the biggest issue with bee
colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steve Shepard, the man that told me
that once there's 7% of the bees have
[SPEAKER_01]: Varroa mites, the colonies are doomed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 7% of the population are infected with
the Varroa mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That spells the death of the colony.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Metarhizium antisephile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an entomopathogenic fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it can produce a cordyceps
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the area, this is what I
presented today at the Bee Conference
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is very new information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next few slides come from
Washington State University, Steve
[SPEAKER_01]: Shepard's team, and Brandon Hopkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a new post-doc, Nick Nagler,
they treated ten hives with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Metarhizium fungus, and ten hives with a
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was thinking about the delivery
system, and the simplest delivery system
[SPEAKER_01]: by far was just a petri dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we put a petri dish on the top of
the frames, and the bees immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: started scavenging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's sugar in here, also, malt sugar,
agar, so I'm trying to have an appetite
[SPEAKER_01]: for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in a matter of a day,
they actually removed all of this entire
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus and the malt agar, and then the
petri dish is basically empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is the newest research results
just came in in the past two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high significance on day five and
day seven, where we were able to eliminate
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more mite fall, normalized mite
fall, the control is in gray here,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sporulating, the mycelium is in red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now bear in mind, this fungus that we
have, it was not, they grow, they kill
[SPEAKER_01]: mites, and also ticks, and carpenter ants,
and termites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a species, there's different
varieties that are tuned for different
[SPEAKER_01]: targets, insect targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing with WSU is after only
three days, some of the mites fell,
[SPEAKER_01]: from infection with this fungus,
and now we put the mites onto a petri
[SPEAKER_01]: dish, we grow out the mycelium as a
second, as a first generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we'll grow out the mycelium,
we'll do that again, and then we'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: more mite falls, and then we'll then
navigate to find a new strain that uses
[SPEAKER_01]: epigenesis and natural selection to find a
more virulent strain of metarysium against
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's micro factor number four,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: F of D, metarysium, infection for all
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I write this new book,
I have literally my manuscript on the
[SPEAKER_01]: table, and then this journal comes,
and I was really happy when I made the
[SPEAKER_01]: front page of the journal, and it was
about colony collapse, and what these
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists found out, that the colonies,
for those of you who don't understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: colony collapse, there's lots of different
factors, but basically the bees just
[SPEAKER_01]: abandoned the nest, and in two days,
they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousands of bees that were there two days
earlier, now they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like they were dead all around
the nest, they could be some, but most of
[SPEAKER_01]: them are just gone, and it's like,
where'd they go?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens is that the workers
that used to forage for an average of nine
[SPEAKER_01]: days are now foraging for four days,
so the nurse bees taking care of the brood
[SPEAKER_01]: then become worker bees to go out and get
more pollen, because there's not enough
[SPEAKER_01]: worker bees coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their foraging range has been limited,
both temporarily as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: geographically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they looked at the honey and
abandoned beehives, they found that the
[SPEAKER_01]: honey lacked p-chimeric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, p-chimeric acid, I know p-chimeric
acid, but when mycelium breaks down wood,
[SPEAKER_01]: it produces p-chimeric acid, and so I was
astonished to learn that p-chimeric acid
[SPEAKER_01]: controls the cytochrome P450 pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a detoxification pathway that all
animals use, we primarily have it in our
[SPEAKER_01]: liver, many of you have livers
detoxification, detoxify the xenobiotic
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, and the bees only have 47
genes, but these genes are controlled by
[SPEAKER_01]: p-chimeric acid turning on the cytochrome
P450 pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most insects have 80 of these genes,
humans have 60, but bees only have 47.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the absence of p-chimeric acid prevents
the bees from detoxifying pesticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: insecticides, all sorts of other toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went, aha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the mycelium is producing p-chimeric
acid as it breaks down wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I surmised, oh my gosh, well the bees
want p-chimeric acid, they need to go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: watered water, and you take away the
deforest, you do monoculture, you use
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicides to kill all the fungi in the
environment, you're dismantling the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway of detoxification that bees need
because p-chimeric acid is no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it turns out that glyphosates,
this is something Monsanto doesn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: you to know, but it's very well
established that glyphosates interfere
[SPEAKER_01]: also with the P450 pathway, even in
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has now just been found,
glyphosates are in all of our foods,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the United States the EPA was not
testing for this until just recently,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's widespread throughout our entire food
chain now, so this is also interfering,
[SPEAKER_01]: we believe, with the detoxification
pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's starting to make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, remember my garden giant mushrooms
were supposed to be red, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: white, and then I had this epiphany,
oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, as it turns out, it stimulates
mushrooms to form when you light,
[SPEAKER_01]: but mushrooms are most highly stimulated
in the light, in the blue light,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 320 nanometer range.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stimulates the mycelium to produce
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the mycelium is brought underneath
the wood chips, has no light, and when you
[SPEAKER_01]: get the wood chips that are taken off and
the mycelium is exposed to light,
[SPEAKER_01]: it stops lacases, which are breaking down
the wood, because now it's triggering the
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms to form, so why digest now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's produce a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycelium stops lacases, picaric acids
are stopped, and then tyrosinase is coded
[SPEAKER_01]: for that leads to a pigment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bees, I think, and the bees can see
down to 320 nanometers, we can see down to
[SPEAKER_01]: about 400 nanometers, so we can't see
this, but I think the bees are buzzing
[SPEAKER_01]: along the habitat, and are looking down to
see if there's any blue reflective
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium, and there's a whisper of that
mycelium coming up, that they can go down
[SPEAKER_01]: there, dislodge the wood chips,
get the picaric acid that they need for
[SPEAKER_01]: detoxification, but once light hits that
mycelium, mushrooms will form,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it turns out that it interferes with
the tyrosinase pathways that causes
[SPEAKER_01]: melanization, so I think my mushrooms are
white, because the bees were interfering
[SPEAKER_01]: with tyrosinase by exposing the wood chips
prematurely to light, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's my hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the first audience has gotten
this, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is micro factor number five,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: F of E, from the peak of our acid,
activates the detoxification pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we started working, and we didn't
develop mycelium, so this is all mycelium
[SPEAKER_01]: grown on rice, it's super sweet,
it's delicious, and so we started
[SPEAKER_01]: developing Michael Honey, great coffee,
by the way, super delicious, we eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: come out with something like this for
consumers, and then we started presenting
[SPEAKER_01]: different forms of mycelium, all grown on
rice, to Steve Shepard at WSU,
[SPEAKER_01]: for longevity stress experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: In captivity, worker bees live for about
30 days, they kind of die after that
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the bees are being fed extracts,
and this is the artist's comp,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the hideout, for instance,
so this is a 10% solution, and the bees
[SPEAKER_01]: that are exposed, and they're drinking
this sugar water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, beekeepers feed their bees,
commercial beekeepers in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar water, and it's 50% sugar,
50% water, or corn syrup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, the idea is we can put this
Michael Honey, or the extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: into the sugar water, and that way the
bees then can be consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so after doing this work,
now Steve Shepard and his team at WSU,
[SPEAKER_01]: a summary of the best mushrooms that show
benefit to the bees, are uniquely
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with first trees, and they are
the Red Delta Polypore, it also goes on
[SPEAKER_01]: fir trees, it goes on fir trees,
Chaga, now remember Chaga was active
[SPEAKER_01]: against flu viruses, that you saw in the
BioShield program, Amidu, which my hat is
[SPEAKER_01]: made from, remember Amidu is the first
antiviral ever found from a mushroom,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the mosaic virus came from Amidu,
and the red reishi mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's a summary of some of the best
results that we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longevity effects of Amidu,
my hat is made from, this is the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: bees that are surviving, highly
significant, and there's nearly a doubling
[SPEAKER_01]: of the number of bees that are at this
time-critical period where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: foraging, so there's many more bees out
there that are surviving compared to the
[SPEAKER_01]: controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve made the statement, in 39 years of
experience studying bees, he's unaware of
[SPEAKER_01]: any materials that can extend their life
to work more than this, and then we go and
[SPEAKER_01]: we look at the mushroom that bears
introduced, the Red Delta Polypore here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and here's the control, and at a .1%
solution, there's also nearly a doubling
[SPEAKER_01]: on the number of bees that are alive
during these later stages of their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is at .1%, that's one drop per
thousand drops, one milliliter per liter,
[SPEAKER_01]: a very small amount of this extract from
the Red Delta Polypore, and then looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at the viruses, and this is what we've
drawn up, the control, the viruses go up
[SPEAKER_01]: one week to the next week, and looking at
the, as we increase the concentrations,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the viruses then plummet,
and then looking at the effect of viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: by the Red Reishi, on the bee viruses,
they go up with the controls, blue to
[SPEAKER_01]: blue, and then as we increase the
concentrations, the viruses plummet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the summary of these initial results,
so with the rice control, the bee viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: go up with these extracts, remember,
this one is the biogeoprogram,
[SPEAKER_01]: Acovillia's blue viruses, this one's
Acovillia's blue viruses, the Red Delta
[SPEAKER_01]: Polypore is a sister species, it's called
Plummetopsis panicula, Agaricon's called
[SPEAKER_01]: Plummetopsis officinalis, that's
interesting, so we've got a cluster of
[SPEAKER_01]: four Polypore mushrooms rotting in wood,
it's highly significant in extending the
[SPEAKER_01]: lifespan of bees, and also reducing their
viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, now I got really fascinated with
this, and I started to become a literature
[SPEAKER_01]: house, looking at bee viruses,
and in the past 80 years, from Asian bees,
[SPEAKER_01]: the deformed wing virus has spread all
over the world, originally from Asia,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now it is thought that all bees in the
world have the deformed wing virus,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is four articles in 2016,
where the deformed wing virus is described
[SPEAKER_01]: as A primary, one article, B primary cause
of colony collapse, being ventured by the
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mites are like dirty syringes,
they're shooting a slew of viruses,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only the deformed wing virus,
but other ones as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, Anju TL came out with this
article, saying that the deformed wing
[SPEAKER_01]: virus is a leading contender as a cause
agent of colony decline, and another
[SPEAKER_01]: article here in 2016, by MacMahon,
said that there's a global pandemic of DMV
[SPEAKER_01]: is spreading throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the latest research results,
that was very encouraging, and I really
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to just profusely thank the
Washington State University and Dr. Steve
[SPEAKER_01]: Shepard for having faith and carrying this
mission forward, because our latest
[SPEAKER_01]: results hold on to your hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the latest results, with the Omidu
mushroom, the mushroom that my hat is made
[SPEAKER_00]: from, and the red ray sheet, that
reducing, Omidu reduced the deformed wing
[SPEAKER_00]: virus 1,000 to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a matter of about two weeks,
two to three weeks, the red ray sheet
[SPEAKER_01]: decreases the late Sinai virus 500 to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have species specificity here,
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have different polymer mushrooms more
active against uniquely different species
[SPEAKER_01]: of viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then, Jay Evans, the renowned,
a virologist for the USDA, sent this
[SPEAKER_01]: statement to me recently, I've never seen
such strong anti-viral activity of bee
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses I've seen in miscanthus's
extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, for the queen breeders out
there, they have viruses, and it turns out
[SPEAKER_01]: that Chaga reduces the black queen cell
virus by more than 100 to one,
[SPEAKER_01]: as does the red ray sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I got really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent all this money on this,
and so I did file U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: patent, I filed the international patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did massive searches through every
language, you know, English, German,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chinese, Japanese.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no prior art.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one had ever made mention of this
anywhere in Assam today for popular
[SPEAKER_01]: literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, the first one, the patent has
now been approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is publishing October 25th.
[SPEAKER_01]: The international patents will soon
follow, and this is the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: communication I can give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all hands on deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are facing six acts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a direct threat to food
biosecurity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in order to be charitable,
you have to be profitable to be
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that condition, I am announcing that
I am going to open source for the comments
[SPEAKER_01]: of all these bee patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have to be profitable enough to be
able to show people this delivery system,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make thousands and thousands of gallons
of these extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is totally deliverable, deployable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of these barrels can
probably treat, you know, 10,000,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20,000 hives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tremendous, it's so aggologically
rational.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so participable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so deliverable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It benefits from biodiversity of the
forest ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're intimately tied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the irony of this is that we all grew
up with the Winnie the Pooh.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all knew that bears went into wild logs
because the honey would be there for the
[SPEAKER_01]: beehives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I propose to you the stevesian mushroom
bee hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bee scratches introduce mushroom mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, woodpeckers do, and humans do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bees attract the rotten logs.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that for a neurological benefit?
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycelium reduces viruses, provides
peak humeric acid, reduces xenomyotic
[SPEAKER_01]: toxin exposure because the mycelium breaks
down toxins, bolsters the general immunity
[SPEAKER_01]: of bees, and I think they strengthen the
wing span.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the deformed wing virus,
and you saw that very terrible bee didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have very good wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been kicked out of the hive
and would die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what about the bees whose tensile
strength has been diminished by low
[SPEAKER_01]: titers, low infection population rates of
the deformed wing virus?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that may be why the bees cannot
forage as far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their wings basically are not strong
because they're impugned by the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it increases longevity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we don't know if this is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a great project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So folks, micro factor number six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now this story starts to get really,
really, really strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm such an idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my new book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this communication about peak
humeric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get really interested in being able to
help the bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm thinking to myself, I got 70
strains of agaricon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I set into the Bible shield program seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three of them were active against gluten
pox viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other four were not.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably why the pharmaceutical
industry missed this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I had 70?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get a superstar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gonna be one that's gonna be
really pungent compared to the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get a whole NIH virology.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bio shield program had been shut down
several years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I write NIH virology, and 17 minutes
later, the director of virology at NIH,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Sang, T-S-E-N-G, just retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically said, hi, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love working with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great working with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had such a high hit rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a percentage of the bio shield
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had 30% hit rate, but they dropped
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a really high percentage of
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, but you know, we won't
bioprospect for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't do biogadic vaccination.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to send us in a pure structure,
a pure molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, good news, bad news.
[SPEAKER_01]: NIH would love to work with us,
but we have to send in a pure molecule and
[SPEAKER_01]: before they'll accept it, they have to
have their virologists look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And number one, has anyone ever tested
this before?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to be somebody else's
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want a new molecule, a new activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, the psychologically doesn't
make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, you know, I have this great
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: NIH will give me, they give me literally
millions of dollars worth of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I have this wonderful opportunity
to do a good research, but they want me to
[SPEAKER_01]: send in a pure molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more than 200,000 molecules
being expressed by the mycelium and in
[SPEAKER_01]: these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which molecule will I send them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't I send them peak numeric acid?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went into the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at the deligmentation pathways,
found two excellent articles that showed
[SPEAKER_01]: that peak numeric acid, as it breaks down,
the mycelium breaks down to wood,
[SPEAKER_01]: because peak numeric acid produces vanilla
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why wood smells like really
wonderful wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wood has that vanilla-like smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vanilla acid is related to peak
numeric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I chose 20 molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I ordered the molecules from Sigma
Chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, so I sent in 10 molecules to
NIH, virology, and they got all got
[SPEAKER_01]: accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, yep, no one's ever looked at
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll test these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I sent another second set,
second set of 10 molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will show you some of those results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is against HPV, the human
papillomavirus, for which there is no good
[SPEAKER_01]: antiviral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the selectivity index number,
anything under 10, is highly active?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is really lowly highly active.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only at 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, there's some antiviral activity,
but there's no antiviral drug that is on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market today that can control HPV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are, they're a red sheet from
the NIH virology.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is their red lettering, this sample,
this sample, this sample, this sample,
[SPEAKER_01]: this sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit friggin' home run here, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five of these molecules turn out to be
highly active against HPV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the SI numbers are just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're 125, 125, 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the strain, and then we test it
against these viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Varicella zoster, the cause of shingles,
FG virus, the oncovirus causes cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The human papillomavirus causes cervical
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Norovirus, as many of you know about in
the ships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And polio, turns out, of the 20 molecules
that I sent, eight of them are highly
[SPEAKER_01]: active and better at the positive
anti-drug controls than the National
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute of Health virology, used as a
standard control.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strangest one of all is vanilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vanilla acid, vanilla, is more potent than
a cyclobeer against the shingles virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've all seen the TV commercials are
everywhere now about people getting rashes
[SPEAKER_01]: and how harmful shingles is, they're
pushing a cyclobeer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a $10 billion now op patent drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And vanilla, no one tested vanilla as an
antiviral until I tested it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all comes from my association of
B-chimeric acid and D-limitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you chemists here in the audience,
I know this, so this is for you chemists,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are other structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is basically showing the
comparison of the drug controls versus our
[SPEAKER_01]: activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the list of the new antiviral
molecules, new to science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to summary, we have the drug
controls, acyclic, ribovirin, interferon,
[SPEAKER_01]: alpha, TB, synovivir.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the viruses, the drug controls,
our samples are more potent than all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these new standard antiviral drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is micro factor number seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Antiviral molecules related to D-chimeric
acid are active against viruses,
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogenic to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I present to you, for the first time
ever, a micro factorial equation,
[SPEAKER_00]: a formula for a paradigm shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not false emphasis, paradigm shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: A revolutionary solution for disease
prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to achieve paradigm shift,
it's F of A plus B plus C plus D plus E
[SPEAKER_01]: plus F plus U.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what all these correlate
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just walked you through the entire story
of the micro factorial equation that can
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to a paradigm shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wait, there's something more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out, remember, Amidu extracts
limit the mosaic virus to harm plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's the case, then we can create
foliar sprays of Amidu mycelium that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can spray on the crops to prevent plant
viruses and also give bees access to the
[SPEAKER_01]: antiviral properties of Amidu mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no examples of viruses that affect
plants that cross over to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is an example of the common
solution that can control two different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of viruses in two different
kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does this want to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's micro factor, you know,
I?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's F of I?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a gateway, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a gateway to a whole new arena of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is ready for the paradigm shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: These micro factorial equations can be
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be targeted specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have ecosystems, disease vectors,
populations of the animals, of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we are all, hopefully now,
be mushroomed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scientists across disciplines need to
work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Micro diversity is our biodiversity and
our biosecurity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I present to you the humans,
trees, bears, mushrooms, the birds and the
[SPEAKER_01]: bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: All terrestrial organisms evolved to be
interconnected in the mycelial web of life
[SPEAKER_01]: within the Earth's natural internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we follow the path of mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We respect nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We respect indigenous peoples.
[SPEAKER_01]: We honor the descendants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a shout out to the first peoples.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concept of seven generations is
something that we all need to adopt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be part of our
constitution, Franklin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the constitution of the UN,
the United States, Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we also need to rephrase the
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to celebrate decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our new bumper sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing that you can do is put wood
in your backyard and just let it rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to just.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a new concept here, and my friend
Sasha here is a graphic artist,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we co-involve this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is now time to launch into the
microverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lived forever together within the
mycelial, micro molecular matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am bound by confidentiality,
but I highly suggest that you watch Star
[SPEAKER_01]: Trek that comes out in January of 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we have the ability of
terraforming other planets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be able to create micro genomes
that can be launched into other planets in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to transform and create biospheres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to wax philosophical.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the most expansive view of the
universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It conforms to the same archetype that is
shared by mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the computer internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: By neurons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I personally believe matter begets
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life becomes single cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Single cells become strings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strings branch become membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these archetypes are resident
throughout the cosmos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inevitably we will find mycelial life
network being more based organisms on
[SPEAKER_01]: other planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to leave you now with a short
two minute movie that Louis Schwartzberg
[SPEAKER_01]: and I are collaborating on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the very end of my talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mushroom mycelium represents rebirth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rejuvenation.
Regeneration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungi generate soil that gives life.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mission is to discover the language of
nature of the fumble networks that
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate with the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe nature is intelligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that we lack the language skills
to communicate with nature does not impute
[SPEAKER_01]: the concept that nature is intelligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It speaks to our inadequacy for
communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't get our act together and
common commonality and understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: the organisms that sustain us today,
not only will we destroy those organisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we will destroy ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have a paradigm shift in our
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will it take to achieve that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I die trying, but I'm inadequate to the
task to make a course change in the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution of life on the planet,
okay I try.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact is I try.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people are not trying?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you knew that every breath you took
could save hundreds of lives into the
[SPEAKER_01]: future, how do you walk down this path of
knowledge?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't you run down that path of
knowledge as fast as you could?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe nature is a force of good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good is not only a concept, it is a
spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hopefully the spirit of goodness
will survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Jeff Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Steve Chepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.
Thank you.
