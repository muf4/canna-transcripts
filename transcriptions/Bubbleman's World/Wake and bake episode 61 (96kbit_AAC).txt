[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, job bless, Zach Jutras.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you in the room early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not that early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a quarter after 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already had my breakfast,
wake and bake multiple times, gone for a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful dirt bike ride with friends,
and now I'm back and I remembered about
[SPEAKER_01]: all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remembered the importance of not
forgetting about my daily wake and bakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, I've got my pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my dark crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still got a bunch of bottles of these to
give away, but I think I'll go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: giving them away once I get back home and
have a little bit more ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: organize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a lot of people by
surprise today because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't know we're going live.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only 14, oh, 26 people in the room
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick Lutes, welcome Zero Tilt Gardens and
Brett Armstrong and Mack Lee and Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everyone's doing really well today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys can hear the
birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really quite pleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a bunch of people here, about 15 of us
in the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got side-by-sides, quads,
dirt bikes, all sorts of stuff and really
[SPEAKER_01]: lovely flowy, flowy trails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I've been doing on my day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm in full gear right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So got my boots on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got shoulder pads on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a chest plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a spinal plate, shin pads,
a whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to take care and be responsible when
you're out there having fun on these crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think I'm going to do it the
same way as I did yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do the giveaway right away
while there's only, oh, now there's 121
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like that, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's 126 of you guys out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to pick a number again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you to guess yet,
please, but I'm going to pick a number
[SPEAKER_01]: between one and 50, you can start guessing
now, and it will be for a dab mat,
[SPEAKER_01]: a Sasquatch dab mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same as yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got those numbers coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen a couple of ones that are close,
but not quite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three people have already guessed one same
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain numbers seem to be more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, I am the pump, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I do see that number, I don't care
if it's, oh, Josh Warner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh Warner, you, my friend, won yourself
a dab mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Josh Warner came up with the number 47.
[SPEAKER_01]: At 11 16 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you came up with it earlier and it
showed up on your screen, but not mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: apologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh is the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Josh, if you don't mind sending me an
email at bcbubbleman at iCloud.com,
[SPEAKER_01]: send me the, I want to see it say
Sasquatch dab mat, your name and your
[SPEAKER_01]: address, and then I will ship it out to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I guess all that's really left to do
is have a little bit of a conversation and
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everyone is doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Marcus is the pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slow connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to hear, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some nine pound hammer bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got a little bit of that Justin
Trudeau that I suppose I'll squeeze a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit out, even though it's,
I wouldn't say it's super warm,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not super cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shatter would be very hard in the
temperature that I'm in right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, just got lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dropped my dabber and it just missed this
little puddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like nicer globs a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, too bad you're not the pump,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too bad you're not the pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and apologies to anyone on these wake
and bakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I gotta be apologetic because I
have inexplicably, unbeknownst to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: accidentally offended one of my viewers
who's certainly not one of my viewers
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me some emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get into it too much, but listen,
don't take what I say too seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've somehow offended you, definitely
send me an email and get a dialogue going
[SPEAKER_01]: and explain where I've offended you,
because it's not my intention to offend
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to spread good vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely don't want to be getting
people all pissed off and choked at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a bit of a joker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a little bit of a sick humor,
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, sir globs a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too bad you're not the pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a rip, shall we?
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy from yesterday's wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the blotting screens work for squishing
bubble or should I be?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they do, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's how we originally started it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would roll it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you watched the first rosin video I
ever did, it was a square piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rolled it up in a little ball and then
just did the cruel sense of humor like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's cruel, but it's
definitely sadistic sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sick at best, but I'm definitely not
malicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not out to harm any of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no intentions of causing internet
wars that go on forever and ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I have been on the internet for
over 20 years and it seems like I somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: am always attracting it, so must be doing
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, 420 Wild Dragon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already been riding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went for a really nice ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did a huge hill climb and we're going
to... Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeder Steve just hit me up in text.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was his birthday the other day,
so I'll have to say happy belated birthday
[SPEAKER_00]: to Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark crystal.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to dial in the dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just need to lighten up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they don't, I still don't mind a
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind apologizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not beneath me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've said something that's been
offensive and someone can point it out to
[SPEAKER_01]: me, I do appreciate if they can let me
know what I've done so I can either say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is, I think, how I ended the last
email to that gentleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which isn't really that good, but hey,
enough of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about hill climbs and
motherships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at how dirty my bowl is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wide awake and pretty baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good, Octo Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Josh, please ask me in the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did miss that question, but I saw what
someone else wrote.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard for me to...
[SPEAKER_01]: read everything that you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size KTM do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'd walk you over to it,
but I swear I think the internet will die
[SPEAKER_01]: if we go over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's my bike.
[SPEAKER_01]: 450 EXE KTM.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a huge group with us here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh Warner, I can absolutely shout you
out for your birthday, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will send you a birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: A birthday card, in fact, with your dab
mat that you won today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday to Josh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's a good birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's a great birthday, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also hope every day after that is
also just as great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, shit, one day out of 356 is not
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more good days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, beamers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you sign... What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you sign that dad meant for me for my
birthday tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I broke my neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, jeez.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: ATVs are scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of dangerous, but so are dirt bikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have the ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been riding dirt bikes for 37 years,
so I definitely have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, happy birthday to you as well,
Robbie Abbott.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants you to sign it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thinking liquid, nitron, fresh cut and
tossing into a tumble now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Birthday is tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Josh, we will sign your dab mat
for you and I'll send you a little
[SPEAKER_01]: birthday card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I shouted you out and tomorrow I'll
shout you out as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to have a birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Body cast for 41 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I have not knock on wood done
that and I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try to stay away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, 49.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy belated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lion groves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear some bikes snapping away here in
the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect in the very near future,
I'm going to have to bugger off,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice meadow behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple of deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the deer, they were just over by
that tree this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my tents right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look out the window, see a couple of
little deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I hear the two strokes are lighting up
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sounds like brapping might be in order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we brapping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, we're brapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, I would love to take
another hit, but I got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everyone, for watching and
sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of the vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's camping vibes, so I'm not really
doing the whole educational try to drop
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge on hash making and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to share my vibe with you guys
here while I'm away on my camping trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been on this camping trip for
almost three and a half years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to go on this trip twice a year
with these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my first time in three and a
half years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coincidentally, I have a three year old
son, so you can put those two together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, guys, have a great day and may the
full melt bless your bowl sooner than
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, everybody.
