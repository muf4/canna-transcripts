[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, Puff Wednesday and Chester's in the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, how we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it been since Amsterdam, since we
filmed?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys don't know Chester,
go back in the videos and watch our
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusive tuk-tuk ride through the streets
of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know what a tuk-tuk was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's sort of an Asia thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've traveled Thailand or India,
Southeast Asia, you'll definitely know
[SPEAKER_01]: about the tuk-tuk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the bicycle ones, which is what we
were on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a way to travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing about that is that they go
into the sidewalk parts that no cars are
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when she was slowing down and
getting through those two little... So
[SPEAKER_01]: that was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys saw when I left here,
I grabbed some cuts and those cuts were
[SPEAKER_01]: for my good friend Chester.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got them right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: God loves me.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this nice styrofoam box that's all
cooled inside with frozen packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I only cut three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was extremely busy and had quite a bit
of... Diving into the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go through these right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the TGA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little pole 13 male pollen smacking
an Ortega cross with C99.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's a crazy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the bubble right there if you want
to take a little rip of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't I give you a rip of my own fresh
frozen bubble that I grew from this very
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I support that whole heart of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that came from my good buddy Ron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, oh yeah, it's Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought those if you watch the videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in Kasselgarh in the Kootenays
near Nelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I picked up that
particular one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now here I am in Toronto passing it
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice vapor rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there we are with the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll do really well with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows incredibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be fairly resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: From things like bugs and mildews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they won't be running into any of
that with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just never know though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to know though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is nice to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so secondly, we got the Breeder
Steve cut, the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a special thing right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very special thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing Breeder Steve too, like it's more
than special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took a long time to get here, but thank
you, Steve, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: For real, it did, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for you, Stevie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time favorite in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hazy, skunky variety that everyone
loves, even people that don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally the salmon of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that don't like fish, but they'll
eat salmon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the sweet skunk is to people
who don't smoke or like herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that one that everyone will get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just got that certain sweetness to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then last but certainly not least,
the Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Congo is another really nice African
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really just nice up there with the sweet
skunk in the sense that it's a good stable
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually got a chance to see this
plant grow at almost 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like I had never seen anything like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hope you do something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it to 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share your genetics, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on a puff Wednesday, too bad Johnny
B's downstairs right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He feels like he should be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's doing the NextGen conference
pre-meeting before the dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's, of course, their medical advisor
for the NextGen group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's got to be down there and be a
part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, I'm sure he'd be up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Johnny, we'll hold the fort for you
till you get here, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he'll be coming up soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll smoke a pure hash joint with him and
Tony and Ernie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we'll convince Parrish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to see Tony again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to meet Ernie, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Tony in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had about 10 days together
and everybody was just stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were having nothing but fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing a lot of work, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's endless filming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the meantime, working out
deals, introducing people, figuring out
[SPEAKER_01]: logistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's all these different
countries involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty outrageous how it's sort of
snowballing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on a massive, massive conscious
change, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I heard that last nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they just got the last nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to figure out how to,
well, whatever they do, that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't have a clue what that is,
trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the medicine that's done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the acknowledgement and the education
that people have got with the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, it is being worldwide-recepted
everywhere, whether it's called RSO or the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes is the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future will be infused trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herb is the messenger.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bubble is the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to leave you for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chester Scott is genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you in a bit when we puff that
pure hash joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wonderful, wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: God love you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to Puff Wednesday,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always good puffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking Thursday at three in the
morning, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're puffing in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like a different puff one,
is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What an incredible day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We puffed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drove for hours outside of the city,
out of Toronto, and we visited this
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful facility called Weed MD,
in which you'll have seen at the start of
[SPEAKER_01]: this video because I filmed a bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real nice facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, very well put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beds were nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty epic shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vault.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vault.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vault was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole watering system and how
everything's standardized for the exact
[SPEAKER_02]: same nutrient feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the potential thousands of square feet
of greenhouse for outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really just pretty cool to be going into
these places.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good chunk of the day with
great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were with the United Cannabis guys,
Ernie and Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were with the Weed MD guys,
Robbie and Allison, and Mike ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: showing up later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really just a great team of people that
were looking forward to doing some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: affiliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had an incredibly powerful meeting
today after our dinner with all the Weed
[SPEAKER_01]: MD guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our Jamaican contacts come out to
receive the packet from UCAN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it was just a really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hopefully we'll be leaving for
Jamaica on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no hoping.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're leaving for Jamaica on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's no hoping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But tomorrow, before that, which is today,
you speak in what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three or four hours?
[SPEAKER_01]: Five hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I gotta be up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta be in the event in three hours,
so it means I gotta be up in two and I
[SPEAKER_02]: speak in four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is going to be epic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got quite a good line up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next Gen Conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got it going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big, big talks about it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are, hey, they like what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like the education.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of fun because we're able to
come out here and do what we do here every
[SPEAKER_02]: day is educate you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly what we're about, what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just being real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, we seem to be learning a
lot in the process, you know, in this
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed education.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are learning more, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm learning a ton every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the information that is actually
flowing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's quite nice to even talk with
people about it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 10 years ago, we wouldn't do anything
like this because you're risking your
[SPEAKER_02]: family going to jail, losing loved ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's really, we're able to come
out and start talking about it with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really been a great, quick trip to
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to film a little bit of Next Gen
tomorrow, so I'll share that with you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to give Chester the cuts earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see him in parish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and his son came in from the Ottawa
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, he's always a character to
hang out with no matter where or what or
[SPEAKER_01]: when.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known Chester almost 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a fun guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's definitely a fun guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got some good insight, you know,
good wisdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got good information.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been around the scenes, so he's
looking out for better interests in the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best way of putting it,
about good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you a dunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to dunk me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe it'll be a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to dab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a long day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wow, five hours in the car was...
Yeah, five hours in the car was... You
[SPEAKER_01]: know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you've got to do that,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get down on the adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Met a great group of people, saw a real
nice facility in the middle of really
[SPEAKER_01]: being put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else, Jody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well... You did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was very important for John to get a
belt to hold up his pants for the... I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, who would want to have their pants
fall down at the... See, when I was at the
[SPEAKER_01]: lobby...
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like your worst nightmare when
you're speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about your pants... Pants down by
the... Show them losing weight was just a
[SPEAKER_02]: good thing, but at the same time... I
still can't believe you paid 160 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in... I paid like 50 for
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, wow, that's an expensive
belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yours is like made by the,
you know, from like baby cows or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the only store around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super fancy Toronto, like... Like running
around asking people in the malls,
[SPEAKER_02]: going down, oh, this is the best... Hey,
it wasn't even the most expensive belt,
[SPEAKER_02]: was it?
Wait a second here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to love this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run across the street, limp it,
go down the escalator and walk into a
[SPEAKER_02]: building.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking around for shops to see
restaurants, restaurants, restaurants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: W-S-I-B, WorkSafe in... WorkSafe basically
in Toronto, which we might talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm laughing because my talk is about
W-S-I-B tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm standing at the building looking
for a belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run across the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only places around WorkSafe here in
Ontario is all these expensive shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's where the whole buddy shops
when they work there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make such... I'm not getting into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember where that place was because
you point... It was right across from the
[SPEAKER_01]: hotel that we stayed at.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stayed in last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I remember you pointed and you
were like, hey, that's the WorkSafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I don't even see these things,
but I never had a big battle with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fight for patients' rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I do what I do, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart education, pain control,
and really it's, hey, growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're puffing on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn it into resin and enjoy it in all the
forms that you make.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm soaping my head man tonight
with your long soaping method right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We showed you guys that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be doing that with this D-Nail
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to wrap this video up in a few
seconds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of wanted to wrap Puff Wednesday
up and say, you know... Hey, we... It was
[SPEAKER_02]: a good one!
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't miss you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it all throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long... I've never filmed at Puff
Wednesday from like seven in the morning
[SPEAKER_01]: to like three at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into a Puff Thursday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a damn near Puff 24-hour Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway guys, as always, thanks for
watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess next Puff Wednesday is going to be
in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you... Well, we'll see you in
less than a week because I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: upload every day that we're in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next time you see Puff Wednesday,
we're going to be in Jamaica.
We'll see you then.
