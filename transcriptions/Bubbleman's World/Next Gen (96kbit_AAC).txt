[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am here at the Green Conference just
outside of the Seven Sails Convention
[SPEAKER_05]: Center in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bumped into these crazy guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Jason Wilcox, John Berfello,
Flav, and the Urban Grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just here at the Green Rush
Conference checking out some green.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Purple green.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Purple Conference over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Purple Rush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we UBC chemo?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: World famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that in the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: God, is that beautiful herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to roll that up right here right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's supercharge it for you too.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you got Johnny?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: My Little Pony?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: No?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_04]: This came from Green Planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you don't know what it is?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a soaring sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, John's not going to tell us,
but Jason says it's a soaring sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a day timer and it's a soaring
sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: The terpenes smell like terpenes on that
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was handed to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have my own because I'm in this
suit and I'm doing talks and I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: actually be involved on a more
professional level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very professional.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So John spoke earlier today at about 8 o
'clock, 8.20 in the morning and he went
[SPEAKER_05]: over his speech.
[SPEAKER_05]: I videotaped a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll share it with you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm speaking at 11 and then after that
it'll just be kind of cruising around
[SPEAKER_05]: checking out the rest of the speakers and
meeting some people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of people from the financial
district.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of people from the cannabis
industry, but there are a few of us and
[SPEAKER_05]: there are some familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to puff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at these three guys right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some guys that have been making
some action with our injunction,
[SPEAKER_05]: fighting the good fight, keeping our
licenses in order.
[SPEAKER_07]: I give all three of you huge props.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a constitutional right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't lose it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are we spending so much money on
something that's a right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This should just be a given.
[SPEAKER_07]: The government should be funding us in
this fight.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think, dude?
[SPEAKER_07]: I support that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and once again, the great gardener
just comes out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about the injunction.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're supercharging joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're smoking some hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just doing what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wish you guys could all be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great time here in Vancouver at the
Green Rush Conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ma'am.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have no idea, Shar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, have you registered yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_04]: Health Canada has no more involvement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's simply now a diagnosis from your
doctor, a prescription, going to the
[SPEAKER_04]: Health Canada website, downloading a form
from one of several licensed producers
[SPEAKER_04]: that offer cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no more filling up the 30 forms,
sending it into the Health Canada waiting
[SPEAKER_04]: three to six months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of us waited up to a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was like a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to wait to see if you were going
to get accepted or you were going to get
[SPEAKER_04]: right to legal access cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no more doctors charging three
to five hundred dollars for prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically sending that form to one of
your LPs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically overnight, you're going to
have access to legal cannabis medicine,
[SPEAKER_04]: but only flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the U.S., we have legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado and Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: But how many people knew that there was
over 16 medical states in the United
[SPEAKER_04]: States, too?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's only a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next generation is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the next gold people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's why we're all here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to mine it from the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to grow it from the earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all see the difference, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The gold, something we wear as a
commitment, as a ring.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Around their neck for love.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically throughout history,
it's been worth so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what is its real value?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something just to look at,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But cannabis, it has more value than any
other mineral or plant on this earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fuel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fiber.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that medicine, we're just scratching
the surface really.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have no idea how things are going to
happen in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: The future is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The future is now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a billion dollar industry that's
worked upon us here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all here to learn this industry
about its potentials.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody's talking about the green
currency.
[SPEAKER_04]: The green rush.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be here all day, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come and see me at the Mentea booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll also be over at Next Gen's booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope you really enjoy today's
education on cannabis industrial map.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we have to offer, and why we're all
here today, is to understand and learn
[SPEAKER_04]: this new industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The billion dollar industry, but like
Harrison said, it's actually a trillion
[SPEAKER_04]: dollar industry and it's only just
beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lovely lady coming up here next,
Joy Davies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's been leading the platform here
and the provincial and doing a lot of work
[SPEAKER_04]: with local municipalities and doing a lot
of education to what's happening with the
[SPEAKER_04]: system and how people are able to use
cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been a really nice time to be out
and welcome Ms. Joy Davies here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched the industry grow from a time
here in Vancouver when I virtually knew
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody involved in the dispensary
industry to the current scenario where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a tremendous number of players
entering the LP market, as well as it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like more and more gray market
medical cannabis dispensaries opening at
[SPEAKER_01]: least every day in Vancouver every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not often you get the opportunity to
speak to such a varied group of people and
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people here from virtually every
aspect of medical cannabis from patients
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way right up to investors and
companies seeking to enter this sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to assume for the purpose of my
remarks today that because this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: business oriented conference, most of the
people here are already familiar with the
[SPEAKER_01]: general contours of the MMPR, the
marijuana for medical purposes
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are looking to get into the sector
and you're not familiar with the essential
[SPEAKER_01]: basics of the system, I do offer full day
seminars where I come to your place of
[SPEAKER_01]: business, I walk you and your management
team through the MMPR in part to you as
[SPEAKER_01]: much knowledge as I can over the course of
that day so that at least you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: baseline understanding of what the
regulatory scheme looks like and what the
[SPEAKER_01]: rules are so that you can begin to
understand whether this is an opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: that you wish to pursue and what are the
hurdles and challenges in pursuing those
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also not going to discuss the ongoing
litigation under the MMAR or the repealed
[SPEAKER_01]: MMAR, the former regulatory scheme.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Conroy is in the back of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he's going to have some things to
say about that later and I could possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: do it as well as he will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to leave that off to the
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have questions about the ongoing
litigation, I'm happy to answer them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's going to be an interesting
panel later this afternoon as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I am going to focus on with my
remarks this afternoon are three areas of
[SPEAKER_01]: the MMPR that I believe already cry out
for a new regulatory approach or amended
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lens that I'd like to view these
issues through is that of patient access.
[SPEAKER_01]: This program, as Terry mentioned just a
moment ago, the MMAR program and the MMPR
[SPEAKER_01]: program really at base are designed to
ensure and were burdened out of court
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions requiring that patients,
critically and chronically ill Canadians
[SPEAKER_01]: that require or wish to use marijuana for
medical purposes have a reasonable access
[SPEAKER_01]: to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a right that's grounded in
Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and
[SPEAKER_01]: Freedoms and one that's not going to be
going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to, while we cover
all the different aspects of the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: not lose sight of the fact that this
exists because sick and suffering citizens
[SPEAKER_01]: of this country and residents of this
country need access to this medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for them and it can both help
their symptoms as well as we're now
[SPEAKER_01]: learning have potentially curative effects
on a whole host of conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So patient focus in my view absolutely
critical not just for understanding the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory approach that should be applied
but also for the success of your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: As in any business if you're not serving
your customer base and in this case those
[SPEAKER_01]: are the patients that require access to
medical cannabis or wish to use medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or cannabis based products then
you're not going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my focus here is to talk about
really I think three areas in which the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory scheme can be amended either
through lobbying or litigation and those
[SPEAKER_01]: changes will both broaden patient access
as well as benefit people in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: that after all want to have a successful
company that ends up at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_01]: making money and paying your employees and
paying your bills and those kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have three general areas I'd like to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is and I think Joy Davies
probably talked a bit about this this
[SPEAKER_01]: morning although I unfortunately missed
her presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lobbying the provinces for covering the
cost of cannabis and cannabis based
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sad reality as we heard in an earlier
speech before the break is that most
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that are currently using cannabis
for medical purposes or at least many are
[SPEAKER_01]: disabled on fixed incomes or seniors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're living in situations in which
they're simply unable under either the old
[SPEAKER_01]: system or the current system to afford
sufficient quantities of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the provinces and not Health Canada
that determines which medicines to cover
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of reimbursement of the cost of
the medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that there needs to be a
focus put by patients and by licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: producers in this industry on going to the
provinces and making the case that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and cannabis based medicines
should be covered under provincial plans
[SPEAKER_01]: like we have with MSP here in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I'll admit today I am not my usual
self.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically I am pretty stone cold and stoic
but we're coming up on four years this
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday of my husband Mark being in US
federal prison for helping begin 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago the industry and the movement that
we're all sitting here today talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: as if it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And parts of it are illegal, are totally
legal for medical but I gotta admit I am
[SPEAKER_00]: getting tired of waiting for my husband to
come home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a business owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I employ 28 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have four businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: CannabisCulture.com was one of the first
print magazines and websites in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: about marijuana and right now it remains
one of the top marijuana news websites in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: PotTV is a video website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It began when there was no video on the
internet at all in 2000 when my husband
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Emory started it at the same time as
CBC Television launching their
[SPEAKER_00]: revolutionary new video streaming on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband started a lot of things
starting 20 years ago with bringing high
[SPEAKER_00]: times magazines and books and bongs and
pipes into Canada to sell and begin this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry when even a magazine about pot
was prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had a heavy fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mark began 20 years ago this industry
and he created CannabisCulture magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He created PotTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started Emory Seeds which was the
biggest seed business in the world selling
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of seeds and giving all the
proceeds back to financing activism
[SPEAKER_00]: through the magazine, through PotTV,
through ballot initiatives which made
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana legal in a number of US
states, through financing groups like
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Policy Project which is now a
multi-million dollar major lobbying group
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States changing laws in
numerous states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark helped finance all sorts of groups
and rallies and programs and even the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States Drug Enforcement
Administration tracked the millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars he made and said yes, he gave it
away to political activists, political
[SPEAKER_00]: groups and no drug dealers, no drug
connections at all but they still called
[SPEAKER_00]: him the most wanted drug trafficking
kingpin in Canada and had him facing 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years to life in prison for sending seeds
through the mail from Canada paying taxes
[SPEAKER_00]: and never leaving this country while doing
so and running for office creating the DC
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Party, the Marijuana Party of
Canada and of course supporting different
[SPEAKER_00]: political parties across this country when
they choose to support people's rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband was extradited in 2010 and I
was made to take over our business which
[SPEAKER_00]: is not related to marijuana itself in any
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not even stepped foot inside an
operating dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a medical license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any connection whatsoever to
medical marijuana except to say people
[SPEAKER_00]: have a right to use it either to treat
what ails them or to prevent illness from
[SPEAKER_00]: setting in and that is a right we all have
and I will always advocate for the right
[SPEAKER_00]: under this new use of marijuana free from
any risk of arrest or imprisonment or
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the little queue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well thank you all for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Mark Richardson.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a local businessman, owner of Fresh
Headies and Bubble Bags and a distributor
[SPEAKER_05]: for Hemp Hoodlum Clothing here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been involved with cannabis fairly
intimately for the last 25 years actually
[SPEAKER_05]: not 15.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay and I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of this has been through bioassay.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of my experiences have been learned
through my experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to see everyone showing an
interest in cannabis here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be covering an overview of
cannabis by talking a little bit about
[SPEAKER_05]: industrial cannabis which is hemp,
recreational cannabis use and medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis use and I prefer to use the word
cannabis over marijuana mainly because the
[SPEAKER_05]: foundation of marijuana it's a Spanish
word.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rooted in race ism.
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes from the 30s so I'll be referring
to cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of them whether it's to be smoked
recreational to be used medicinally or to
[SPEAKER_05]: be used industrially I'll be referring to
it as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started my own company Fresh Headies
which is a company I've run for the past
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 years and we specialize in glandular
trichome isolation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to get to a picture to give you a
little bit of an idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a glandular trichome right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took this photo myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have two types of trichomes here.
[SPEAKER_05]: A capitate stocked glandular trichome is
the tall one and then the smaller one is a
[SPEAKER_05]: capitate sessile.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are three types of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a third one called a bulbous which
looks exactly like these ones but it
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't have a stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a picture of a cannabis plant that
you can see is just covered in these
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal aspects and Kurt touched on it a
little bit as well as I'm sure Dr. Hornby
[SPEAKER_05]: did.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the medicinal value that we seek
the cannabinoids, THC, the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_05]: the terpenoids, the modulators,
they all are produced inside the glandular
[SPEAKER_05]: head of the trichome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the actual medicine that we're talking
about here today is inside those tiny
[SPEAKER_05]: little glands.
[SPEAKER_05]: The resin produces the cannabinoids that
we have found to feed our endocrine
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoid system and I wanted to tell
you guys just a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_05]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm personally not a doctor but I've been
learning a lot from the doctors that I
[SPEAKER_05]: know and studying and so the system,
the endocannabinoid system or the ECS is a
[SPEAKER_05]: system that each and every one of you here
today has, a system that helps regulate
[SPEAKER_05]: the biological functions in your body.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now in the 90s we discovered receptors in
our brains called CB1 and later discovered
[SPEAKER_05]: a second receptor called CB2 which are
found primarily in the immune system,
[SPEAKER_05]: the GI tract, liver, spleen, bones,
heart and kidney and peripheral nervous
[SPEAKER_05]: system.
[SPEAKER_05]: These discoveries of the cannabinoid
receptors, endocannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_05]: related enzymes that make up what is now
called the endocannabinoid system and it
[SPEAKER_05]: seems to be essential in most of our
physiological systems and it is essential
[SPEAKER_05]: to life as it relates messages that
affects how we eat, sleep, relax,
[SPEAKER_05]: forget and protect.
[SPEAKER_05]: These receptors protect proteins include
endocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course phyto cannabinoids which are
the ones found in cannabis and this leads
[SPEAKER_05]: me into my final discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting beeped here, I'm 16 seconds
over.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear a lot of people say well I support
medical cannabis but not recreational.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well let's took a look at that through the
eyes of the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now obviously smoking, a lot of anything
isn't going to be ideal but vaporization
[SPEAKER_05]: and oral ingestion will feed your
endocannabinoid system and offer
[SPEAKER_05]: preventative means of avoiding health
problems later in life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spoke recently with Dr. David Allen who
specializes in the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_05]: and he mentioned that if people could rid
themselves of the ECS deficiencies this
[SPEAKER_05]: could help avoid such things as old age
diabetes, stroke and heart disease and his
[SPEAKER_05]: real focus is on the ability for the body
to continue to produce insulin through
[SPEAKER_05]: endocannabinoid regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Deficiencies in this older age could cause
old age diabetes which can in turn cause
[SPEAKER_05]: diabetic complications and we know that
cannabis has never caused any harm,
[SPEAKER_05]: never killed a person and in fact this
amazing medicine is one of the only
[SPEAKER_05]: plants, one of the only things people
consume on this earth just for the
[SPEAKER_05]: euphoric side effects and they have been
for centuries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it may sound ridiculous but for me
this is how I started on my road to
[SPEAKER_05]: learning and that I stand in front of you
sharing through my relationship with
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a young person who was experimenting
with experimental cannabis I was able to
[SPEAKER_05]: learn and teach myself about this
miraculous plant as I developed a
[SPEAKER_05]: relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today I'm a federal exempt cannabis user
and grower and can say that growing is an
[SPEAKER_05]: aspect of the plant is part of the healing
that it offers me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gardening aspect of being able to
produce my own medicine within my own
[SPEAKER_05]: space and breed my own strain is one I do
not take for granted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stand before you as supporter of
licensed producers, personal production
[SPEAKER_05]: licenses, dispensaries and all forms of
cannabis trade and sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone should be allowed to grow this
wonderful medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job man, really good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another very bright young girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember companies to actually advocate
for the rights of American farmers and
[SPEAKER_03]: producers and consumers in the United
States to be able to access industrial
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp food products and body care products,
fashion and composite products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a little bit about corporate office.
[SPEAKER_03]: Myself as I said president of the
association, Larry Serbin with Hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: Traders which is also here at the booth
with us if you'd like to visit with him as
[SPEAKER_03]: our vice president.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Levine as our CFO and treasurer and
our ex-president and then our executive
[SPEAKER_03]: director Eric Steenstra.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's just a list of our quick board
as Mark was talking about last week and
[SPEAKER_03]: this just sort of gives you an idea
everything from a fashion to soap to hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: cordication to fiber processing and food
processing as it combines our board.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's some of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we do is a lot is
working directly with Vote Hemp and I will
[SPEAKER_03]: be sharing more about the work of Vote
Hemp here in just a moment but here we are
[SPEAKER_03]: with some of our members as we were up on
Washington DC for our lobby day.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a full organized lobby day where
we were in the offices of our
[SPEAKER_03]: congressional leaders and I will explain a
little bit more about why we were on
[SPEAKER_03]: Capitol Hill and why our lobby days are so
important to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a little bit about Vote Hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the Hemp Industry Association and how
we're registered is quite different than
[SPEAKER_03]: how Vote Hemp is registered and they're
registered as an advocacy group which can
[SPEAKER_03]: actually go then on to Capitol Hill and do
the appropriate lobbying that we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: do in a number of years of Hempfest in
Seattle where this huge number of people
[SPEAKER_02]: come together in August and have stages
and people talking in bands and so on and
[SPEAKER_02]: one time I got to be on the stage just
before 420 and this huge puff of smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: went up and the police who were here and
there all go like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's been that way for some time in
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been involved in this issue now
going back to the mid 70s and while I grew
[SPEAKER_02]: up in Africa my father was a consultant on
the growing of tobacco and the African
[SPEAKER_02]: people, some of them commonly used
cannabis and I'm talking a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: all my father would do was pull up the
plant and throw it on the ground and that
[SPEAKER_02]: was the extent of the enforcement of the
cannabis laws back in I'm talking the 50s
[SPEAKER_02]: and very early 60s and the sky didn't fall
in Africa and it hadn't as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyway I came back to Canada and was
called to the bar in 1972.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a jock before that so I wasn't that
involved in everything in the 60s,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was the early 70s where I became
involved and I'm comparing those days
[SPEAKER_02]: because of what I see here today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright so we're here at the Green Rush
Conference, it's the end of the conference
[SPEAKER_05]: and me and all my buddies here just
popping the place down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out on
greenrushfinancialconferences.com,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they'll have some of the video
available.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace!
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and welcome to Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny B in the house and we just have
woken up the day after the Green Rush
[SPEAKER_05]: Financial Conference that I'll let John
tell you a little bit about, he's been the
[SPEAKER_05]: specialist in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green Rush Financial Conference,
wow it was quite a really amazing event
[SPEAKER_04]: yesterday guys, you know what,
a lot of different crowds but the
[SPEAKER_04]: conference is about bringing a lot of
people in to more or less educate one
[SPEAKER_04]: another on the benefits of cannabis,
on the health issues, the prohibition ends
[SPEAKER_04]: of it, the hemp industry end of it,
right into the financial end of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: finishing off with more of the 420
investors and then we got into,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was such a wide aspect of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a full overview of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was definitely covered by CTV News,
Global National.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh all the newspapers.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the newspapers, it was a great event,
it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked that it was the first event I've
been to potentially ever where when I
[SPEAKER_05]: spoke I didn't feel as though I was
preaching to any choir, I could tell I was
[SPEAKER_05]: literally educating people in the audience
that just had almost no knowledge
[SPEAKER_05]: whatsoever about what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the people there, because it was
a financial conference, are from the
[SPEAKER_05]: financial district and that's,
they came in from this area and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: basically, they're about making money.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know that you can make money now with
cannabis and the laws are changing so they
[SPEAKER_05]: came to check it out and it was guys like
John and Kirk Tussaud and John Conroy and
[SPEAKER_05]: Jody Emery, those were kind of the core
speakers that spoke in regards to more of
[SPEAKER_05]: the roots and then you had financial
people speaking and people that do IP Os
[SPEAKER_05]: and public companies and stock market guys
and those guys were the suits.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you had the roots and the suits and
I'll give that quote to Kirk because
[SPEAKER_05]: yesterday he came up with that at lunch
during the conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think because today I'm wearing,
the roots are right here, I'm wearing my
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp underneath and I'm mixing with some
suits right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well you can be the suit, I'll be the
roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always supporting the coalition so I'm
always supporting my right to grow and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that but right now I am
stepping on stage and we're going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to educate on an international
platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting great coverage on exactly,
well it was, I'm sure you're going to find
[SPEAKER_04]: my talks here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some videos of course taken and
they're going to slowly emerge on how this
[SPEAKER_04]: conference has taken place in our next
direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having that on June 26 in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also going to be an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already almost already sold out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually, there's a lot of hype
around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's already advertising for it,
the media's about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just going to be like,
it's going to be a really good event in
[SPEAKER_04]: Toronto and that's what we're going to
bring to the plate here right now is we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to start merging these industries
together and showing them exactly the
[SPEAKER_04]: proper, well you know what, like you say
there's big money guys and that's their
[SPEAKER_04]: only interest but there's a lot of good
guys out there that exactly what they're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at is not just benefiting
financially but benefiting from the
[SPEAKER_04]: education and getting the proper
information to the patients and
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding this cannabis plant and
really getting involved with exactly what
[SPEAKER_04]: we're both about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure there's going to be a big
change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's coming for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can feel it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was definitely the strangest room full
of people I have ever encountered.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just neat to see these different
worlds sort of leaking into one another
[SPEAKER_05]: and mixing in because there really were
like literally people that you would just,
[SPEAKER_05]: typical people that you would,
the typical stereotype of people that you
[SPEAKER_05]: would see at like a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw the same typical stereotype in all
the suits that were walking around that
[SPEAKER_05]: just looked literally like the certain
ones looked like private investors,
[SPEAKER_05]: certain one looked like lawyers,
they all just wear the suits and then you
[SPEAKER_05]: have the roots and it was just a
definitely interesting mix to see them all
[SPEAKER_05]: both coming together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again brought together by cannabis,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the headline of the story?
[SPEAKER_04]: No hippies here or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: What did they say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was some sort of negative connotation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't, I wasn't trying to be
negative, but what it was is there wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: a bunch of people outside smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of people inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we were.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were all on our trippy sticks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think things have changed now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have.
[SPEAKER_04]: There isn't a bunch of guys outside
smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, we were.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had our pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Flav's ridiculous, crazy little.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did he have his?
[SPEAKER_04]: Me personally?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was running around and kind of mixing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kept going down to my car about every
one hour and doing bond rips a full mill
[SPEAKER_04]: of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: I parked directly on these venues.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was feeding my.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was out front with Ramo and Jason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you must've been hitting bulls
with us in the morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were in the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you were there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So confused yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a long day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long, long day.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were there at seven 30, eight o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: John spoke at eight 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, it was the, you kind of wanted
to be there throughout the whole day and
[SPEAKER_05]: meet all the different people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had your, your talk at 11 and then
there was Jody and.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the different people walking around.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could bump into the owner of the solar
tech ballast and lights, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: great guys coming up with some really cool
new things that they were talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, so I'm looking forward to,
to get some of their products and what,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, what else?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who else do we see?
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw Hillary black was there from the BC
compassion club.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw all the guys met the guys from TH
seed bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: David Hutchinson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, oh, what was the other
gentleman's name?
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a really nice guy too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've got to give them a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got stacks of cards.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all not right here, but there was,
there was, there was a lot of good people
[SPEAKER_04]: at this conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that for my highlight of,
of a whole conference was, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: the amount of media coverage and,
and, and just the fact that people were
[SPEAKER_04]: just so interested in and really taking a
good look at what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hopefully, you know, the next one
that comes to Vancouver will be even,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, busier and more full and more
people will come to just to offer what
[SPEAKER_05]: they have, but also to learn, you know,
cause it's when we all share and learn
[SPEAKER_05]: that you can kind of step this into the
next level of like, how do we build the
[SPEAKER_05]: proper infrastructure to actually put this
all of these ideas you all know that an
[SPEAKER_05]: idea is about 1% inspiration and 99%
perspiration.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got, uh, ideas coming out the in
yang, but how do you execute them?
[SPEAKER_04]: We were, we were talking about that once
we finished the event, we all piled back
[SPEAKER_04]: to campus culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of a really nice
session.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had this big group of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get to film any of that cause we
were literally puffed just so tough,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it was a great group of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, my old business partner, Martin
Ravchuk was there from the harvest and our
[SPEAKER_05]: other partner from the beginning,
uh, John Geo was there who we hadn't seen
[SPEAKER_05]: in forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, Kirk and John Conroy,
um, myself, John, there's a good,
[SPEAKER_05]: great group of people that kind of,
Oh, Matt, I know Horatio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's just, you know, one of the
people has pulled in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really cool to sit down and just
have that like, it was nice to actually
[SPEAKER_04]: have that out for the conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it was necessary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, it was kind of one of the
keys that one day when these conferences,
[SPEAKER_05]: because at the end of the conference,
although you saw us puffing down in there,
[SPEAKER_05]: we were really the only ones and we left
after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure it was just alcohol after
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't it be an amazing that one day
those conferences have the vapor bar and
[SPEAKER_05]: the smoking area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they also have medibles and they
also have, you know, if you want to have
[SPEAKER_05]: your alcohol as well, it would just be so
neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to have to try and
pull that one off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are legal, you can easily do a small
little, um, you know, hire a company to do
[SPEAKER_05]: the catering.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have done it at the Trade
Convention Center.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do it with these guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Infused.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told them we would do a review of their
products and they, they were just like,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, tell us what you like and we'll make
it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So keep an eye out for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Infused.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new bag over company,
um, highly infused cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can check them out actually at www
.infused.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's F-U-Z-E-D saying it like an
American, um, 420.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: So www.I-N-F-U-Z like a Canadian,
E-D 420.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how about I load you up a bowl,
Johnny?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's about that time again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you worked hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: John worked so hard at the event.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did his medtainer table.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was doing news interviews.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was running around like a chicken with
his head cut off.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: At one point in time, some pieces of shit
stole his medtainers from his booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that all about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would do such a thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're sharing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm going to help it burn and just
give it a light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just give him a light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was actually, uh, Mark was on
stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to go see him talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got pulled off to the CTV in the news
with Peter Geringer and Jody Emery was on
[SPEAKER_04]: the other night, last night on the news at
six.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while I walked away from my booth,
these boxes that were sealed, seven of
[SPEAKER_04]: them, and you guys don't know who you are
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You open up the boxes and stole basically
all my medtainers and they were for
[SPEAKER_04]: display, but they weren't open.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were boxes and I guess it is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was one person.
[SPEAKER_04]: The negative part for me about the
conference was, uh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I should never left my booth on
map, but if I was at the academy,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking it's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hang out with puffers and it was just,
oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we didn't give a lot away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was growing pains.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was nice that everybody liked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And well, I made the profits pay for today
with the medtainer guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: They get the good and the bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you very much because,
uh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, uh, more about a good product and
then got the right hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably that needed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, it was a positive.
[SPEAKER_05]: How good did your hit taste if mine tasted
as well, as good as it did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the barb, I find when you do a
ridiculously huge hit of the barb,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's almost a reason to do it just for
the taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I got the first part of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, John and I are well past like
trying to take the biggest rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally did it in our twenties and it's
fun and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys should keep doing it for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, just keep hitting those huge rips and,
you know, the biggest rip you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hilarious, but it does get to a point
where you acquire your stash and you have
[SPEAKER_05]: your medicine all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Full melt surrounded.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just have it whenever you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just find, well that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that hit was a destroyer for most.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like, take one of those and then
like, try to like do your taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't do your taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to do anything where you actually have
to, no, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Try editing this video.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get on Facebook and we laugh at people
because of no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The video that I'm editing right now is
the video we're filming right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: How trippy is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this will be the ending of this
video.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd like to stay slightly ahead of our
time, just like Panasonic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Panasonic, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's their motto.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just slightly ahead of our time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never knew that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a Panasonic guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're too far ahead of your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're a Panasonic guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not really.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one Panasonic television.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a Panasonic guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're ahead of your time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I'm like a little bit more than
slightly ahead of my time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always been just a little bit too
much ahead of my time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it kind of, yeah, you miss it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like having the vapor bar and 2002 in
Vancouver, like 10 years before it became
[SPEAKER_05]: popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's going to be popular?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what should we do right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell everybody because we got to make this
popular now and not in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me think.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the next thing that I'm feeling is
really, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark Clocke nailed it with Mega Hill
Pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's doing a great job with that
medicated pizza and medicated treats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medicated food across the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got another friend who's basically
doing one and it's not really my thing to
[SPEAKER_05]: say on camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's got another idea that's very
similar, but different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't involve pizza at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a great, great idea, great
concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so hopefully we'll be able to talk
about that soon once he's organized
[SPEAKER_05]: himself into getting closer to effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you'd hate to give a great idea away
on camera and just have someone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what was yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of great ideas at this
conference that people want to invest into
[SPEAKER_04]: to make these great ideas bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had three people approach me at the
conference and say that they thought that
[SPEAKER_05]: they could help me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, make a lot of money in this
business and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just sort of was like polite and
took their cards, but didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really.
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels strange when someone approaches
you that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably because I've never been really
approached that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been approached for my skills like
photography or consulting to make hash or
[SPEAKER_05]: something, but never really like just
someone that wanted to use the name that I
[SPEAKER_05]: built for myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've never had anyone approach me
that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it felt a little bit weird from my
perspective, even though I could see from
[SPEAKER_05]: a certain perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be very exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh my God, this could be my big
break.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just sort of let it, you know,
let it sit and just kind of move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, John is smart the way he got
involved with NextGen.
[SPEAKER_05]: NextGen is all about education and
conferences.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're going to be doing an
analytical company, which will all be all
[SPEAKER_05]: about testing and doing all these other
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for John, it's communication and he's
not, he hasn't sold his name to anyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not like backing an LP or you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, he's just John Berfalo that is how.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to educate you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, without John, I wouldn't have been
at the conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jody wouldn't have been at the conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kurt Tussaud wouldn't have been at the
conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: He brought, and quite a few people came up
to me and said, oh, you know, it's really
nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really neat that this part,
this middle part of this conference
[SPEAKER_05]: brought me to the conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know any of these financial
people and it just, these names brought me
[SPEAKER_05]: and I, I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you picked a good group of people out
of the business or out of our scene and
[SPEAKER_05]: into that business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you have a lot of friends in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can pick 20 different people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you guys were the ones that know so
much and you're the pioneers and I look up
[SPEAKER_04]: to a lot of what your skill guides are and
I'd like to see what we have to offer to
[SPEAKER_04]: this industry in which someone,
all of us do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have our different aspect,
but I think these are the people that
[SPEAKER_04]: people are listening to and the financial
guys hear our names too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of guys come up and go,
hey, we watch your bugging my videos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I could make you a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have stock workers that actually came
up from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: are like, I've seen you in a bubble map.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was, it was kind of cool that people
are paying attention to exactly what we're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're educating one another and now the
people that really need the education are
[SPEAKER_04]: one another and we're bringing more people
in that are educating.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to hear the education and it's
being able, great to be able to actually
[SPEAKER_04]: just be involved and bring everybody
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we're all inspirations.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, you know, the game is
inspiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is talked about years ago and a few
people said it, Michelle Rainey.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said we got to get a group of people
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can actually do this this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Michelle was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was one of the big inspirations of why
for me, why my involvement was involved
[SPEAKER_04]: with this conference was that was
something that I remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was about me bringing that medical
aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: She would have been all over this.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got goosebumps thinking about that stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she gave me that inspiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, I actually have to say thank
you to Michelle for being a big part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the inspiration of where I am right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Michelle Rainey, for those of you that
don't know, she was a bank teller that
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark Emory often went to the bank and
dealt with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had interactions and they spoke
and he learned over the, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_05]: it was months or a year or over a year,
but he learned that she had Crohn's
[SPEAKER_05]: disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if he had turned her onto
cannabis or probably he did, but maybe she
[SPEAKER_05]: was using it before.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, he eventually pulled her out
of that job and said, come work for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Michelle really helped together
cannabis culture and all these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much cannabis culture, but the
BCMP, the bookstore.
[SPEAKER_05]: She always was a pleasure to deal with,
with fresh haddies orders.
[SPEAKER_05]: She promoted bubble bags, huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a good friend for a long many
years and it was very sad when disease
[SPEAKER_05]: overtook her.
[SPEAKER_04]: When she was involved with the Treating
Yourself magazine, big stuff in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Michelle was really about having
educational packages out there and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was helping my educational packages
and that's where my link with Michelle
[SPEAKER_04]: came in as we were both doing the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, but anyways, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace and love to her, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rest in peace, Michelle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a great person.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about I give you a bon rip on that
note, John?
[SPEAKER_05]: A more reasonable one, perhaps?
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: See the way it just sort of didn't even
move.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even sure what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bunch of different barbs got left out on
the plate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't remember what's what.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: After a nice hard work and stuff like
that, it was kind of nice to just come
[SPEAKER_04]: back and relax and talk about our great
day yesterday and reminisce today and just
[SPEAKER_04]: talk about what we see looking for the
future and where our positions lie for all
[SPEAKER_04]: of us people involved in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been so passionate about it over our
whole lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want, come check them out in
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not 100% sure that I'm going to be
there, but John will be there and the
[SPEAKER_05]: NextGen team will be there doing another
conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's already given the dates once,
but it's June 26th in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess that's also the convention
center there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not 100% sure, so I'd better make
sure.

[SPEAKER_04]: Puff Wednesday-Thursday.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yesterday was probably one of the most
interesting Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching, guys.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time.
