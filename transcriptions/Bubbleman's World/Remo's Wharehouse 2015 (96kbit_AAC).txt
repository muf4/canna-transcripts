[SPEAKER_02]: Alright guys, Bubble Man here with Remo
the urban grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are at Remo Brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, your new business.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remo Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to take us in for a little walk
or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take you for a tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the sign, Remo Brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks just like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remo Brands, by appointment only.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it totally does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is our reception area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't got a receptionist yet,
so that bell's our receptionist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of our chilling area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little entrance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here's our boardroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right to the boardroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually going to put a wall up
here, but for right now we don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our presentation center and all
our chairs and we've got a kitchenette
[SPEAKER_01]: thing going on in the corner here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a self-contained unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was us, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And continuing on the tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, continuing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, got the Remo Brands sign again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, I'd like to talk briefly
about the colors we've chosen for the
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, we've chosen blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely got the nice big blue
wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue Remo.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue represents water, which you know,
cannabis is 80% water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We contain a lot of water as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you moved 600 liters of it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 400 liters.
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water's a very positive thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of our main colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got white, which represents light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, which grows cannabis,
which again, positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And white is a positive color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gold represents actual gold or wealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bubble Man pointed out it also
represents the color of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are our company colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden mature trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is our snail spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sweet right here, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are our future labels we're
working on right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the future sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my size right here right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we're going to go with 23 liter
jugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we decided to go with five gallon
buckets for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: More recyclable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reusable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take the lid off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use that for putting a plant in if
you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: For watering or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whipping up a batch of bubble.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our kitchen area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kitchen area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dishwasher and coffee maker and microwave
oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have our server room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got all the computer action going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got Joel's office,
Danny's office, Rebecca's office here in a
[SPEAKER_01]: row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we got here?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my office.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Remo office.
[SPEAKER_01]: My little den.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our white board for ideas here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your own little couch action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got my computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of chairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where I come have a meeting
with Remo Brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have myself sitting right
around the corner here just in case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got a vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sweet, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great to see the beginning of Remo
Brands really starting to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heart of the operation right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we call the administration
wing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll go back into the warehouse and
then into production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just waiting for Palette Sheldon to
come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are going to be all the boxes for
our materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought a forklift.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was $17,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Toyota.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be better than paying a limo
bill.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's drive it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got another sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unit 14, deliveries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the future lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Future lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some work to make sure it's made
up right here, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a bunch of weird furniture and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll go into the production side of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the production side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're in the same unit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we just did a full circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just go outside?
[SPEAKER_02]: To the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got some buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is actually going to be our
future showroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for right now, we just have it as
storage for all our containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, when we get our pallet
shelving, we'll be storing it on the other
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just temporary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a nice storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not storage, but a nice showroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And behind this curtain here is
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: The production facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't go on the top deck today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't go on the deck today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can just check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to the top of the stairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting, because this is very
similar to how I would set up a commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial water hash factory,
where I could literally pull, I could run
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 pounds of bud in each one of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 100 pounds, 100 pounds, 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 250 pounds of cannabis that could
be ran through these every 15 minutes and
[SPEAKER_02]: make potentially a pound to a kilo of
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each one of our products is going to
have its own tank and its own pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right here, we call this ISIC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our bartender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pumping out both nutrients and
gels?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for our liquid nutrients only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any liquid nutrients, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this machine runs on air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stacked up to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're going to the gel area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the gel area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big units, hey?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a one-step gel, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Major.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow a lot of cannabis with these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give you an idea of the size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty big.
[SPEAKER_02]: This place just keeps going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the RO machine we just bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be for our gel
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our gel machine is right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call this a tin mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've made 500 liters of gel at a
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I switch some lights on real quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to have the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a beautiful machine, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I say, 500 liters of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to have the RO to be
pumped in line into this thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where all the labeling and all
the packaging and everything is done right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what is this exactly doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this creating the consistency?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it whipping it or mixing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a giant mixer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giant mixer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Produces mucho, mucho gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a specialized gel manufacturing
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, we're in our roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cloning gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the positive words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace, happiness, love, growth,
tranquility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't want vigor out of their roots?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a one-step gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have used this gel and had
wonderful success with it, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I took a picture of the roots
off of a clone and people were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: are you serious?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what the?
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can attest because I myself have used
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roster roots, we'll call that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a complete chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super happy for you guys to see this
sort of growth, to see that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: building your community.
[SPEAKER_02]: More people are getting jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: More people are getting to sort of get
behind the project that is Remo Brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's going to be jobs here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: North American jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I look forward to seeing the growth
of this company as you guys truck along
[SPEAKER_02]: here in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at exciting times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's going to be exponential
growth in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Remo roots could be available
real soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you guys know where you can check
out all these products and we'll keep you
[SPEAKER_02]: in touch with Remo.
