[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we are live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am with Prophecy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are driving through Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 11 o'clock at night right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well they're going to build an
audience for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to go live on Facebook and
we'll be able to see maybe like a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: or two hundred or three hundred people
will come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Halfway Tree, one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pull this case off so it looks
nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's better quality right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going through Halfway Tree soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's where I rehearse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Two Tones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, this is your rehearsal place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two Tones near Halfway Tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Halfway Tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Two Tones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's near.
[SPEAKER_01]: Halfway Tree is a bit from Redis going
towards.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dallas, Texas is in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle Little is in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spencer Kohler, glad you're enjoying your
trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, Jeffrey Sanote just joined.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Prophecy for those of you that
are just joining me and we're driving
[SPEAKER_00]: through Kingston.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Hempra Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Hempra Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron Waite is in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hempra Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're my African pride and it's all that
matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, Hempress and then my mother
came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just talking about moms,
mom, and what incredible abilities that
[SPEAKER_00]: you all have to raise children the way you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really beyond impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were shouting out moms all day today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we spent time in the hills up at
Stone Hill at a beautiful home where some
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing musicians were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to vibe with them for the
most part of the day, dabbing up a storm
[SPEAKER_00]: and just vibing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's up right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were both there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just rocking for the wheel of reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was nice.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully Hash Church will be at the
same place tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be around noon Jamaica time,
9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: West Coast time as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we'll be tuning in live from
this from this house up in the hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fed us beautiful Ital food.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some nice guys from France up
there that are really talented musicians
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing some nice recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all came together really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Evan, Jamaica is amazing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're writing little messages to us,
prophecy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris says lamb, lamb terps, lamb,
lamb's bread terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've been traveling to jam down
about 20 miles and hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spliffing on my jawbone fat like the clock
towers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh vegetation, weed trees and weed
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have to stop and check my ganja link.
[SPEAKER_01]: They move and bow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give me a big head, but I don't want
no ziggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give me no pump, just give me time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want no twiggy now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now two pack, give me one biggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it bigger than biggie from a high
grade, give me, make me a puff,
[SPEAKER_01]: puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble puffs and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: A crisp puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: California puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toronto puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then me puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Ash Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then me puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Spain puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're spliffed still behind your
ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ear, the ear, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I was spliffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were all high, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been puffing and dabbing all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of dabbing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were like two, three in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were loving it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really nice to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Zach Jones and Kevin Monaco into
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a bunch of live people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello mom again, in case you didn't catch
me say hello the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my brother Etier Fontaine from
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be in tomorrow morning as we will be
doing Hash Church live from Kingston,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Julio from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Julio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Julio.
Julio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy your night, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you in church tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Porter Granger says awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stephen Simmons says good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you what a great day it
was today waking up bummed out at my hotel
[SPEAKER_00]: all alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called up prophecy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just like, I'm coming over right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drove up to Stone Hill and chilled for
eight to 10 hours, I would guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunkman Sam is in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Skunkman Sam is a huge lover of all
things reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, his reggae collection was one of the
most impressive ones I'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunkman Sam need to get some prophecy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Skunkman Sam has some prophecy.
Does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure Skunkman Sam has some prophecy.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where he is right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ron Jones says hello,
Bubble Man and company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Smash says good evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, John Smash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just driving through the streets of
Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys wanted to catch a little of the
drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people out in different areas
listening to music and making food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the things I love about
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the people are really engaging
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not all hiding inside their homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many roadblocks have we gone through
tonight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three roadblocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've been through three roadblocks,
but they don't pull us over for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having an okay time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash Church will be at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow, West Coast time, 12 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just, we're just driving back from
the studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were away all day and now we're heading
back to my room for the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll head back to his place and in the
morning we're gonna link back up and head
[SPEAKER_00]: back over to the studio and see if we
can't have a good long Ash Church with
[SPEAKER_00]: intermingling and of course some reggae
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of doing Ash Church but
then taking a break when a great song is
[SPEAKER_00]: being played live and pick up the computer
and walk over to the band and just let
[SPEAKER_00]: them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you do love Jamaica and reggae,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up from Winnipeg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelsey Skye Wesley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's not too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard it was minus 45 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wagwan Bubbleman from Cameron Leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tommy West just joined the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a whole bunch of cool people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that what we're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do you do when you've been
puffing all night long and it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight and you're driving through
Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_00]: You look for veggie patties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where can we find these veggie patties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are these patties you speak of,
prophecy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You about to take some rips?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't have my torch on me
right now but if I did, I would be taking
[SPEAKER_00]: rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be taking rips when we get back to
the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now we might see if we find some
patties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we find patties, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he's puffing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were puffing on cheese kush all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fire raws and I was dabbing up the
whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put their own music on when they
came up to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when Kidis Eye came up and when the
guy from the Kongos came up and when
[SPEAKER_00]: prophecy came up, I put their song on the
stereo while they're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Ron, I didn't bring terpenes but
Tony's arriving tomorrow and he'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes so we'll be absolutely
blessing them up with the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are here at our destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to say bye to the Bubble Man's
World Crew prophecy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, enough respect, enough love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep checking in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if prophecy's on the move
with the Bubble Man in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to all the crew, let's go to church
tomorrow and keep dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, keep the connection going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, check out Prophecy Reggae
Music Facebook, like my page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy a Prophecy album, Break Loose album or
a Freeman album.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be on tour come this April in
California so you hook up Prophecy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Reggae Life Band scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go check out something about Prophecy
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of music out for right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bless.
