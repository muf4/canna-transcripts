[SPEAKER_00]: the inside Okay, remember who's correct in
all of this the pump is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at these guys answering already What
I want to know About oh, thank you bingo
[SPEAKER_00]: Lombardi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know whoever won the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his second time winning Testicle is
the answer actually cannabis king with the
[SPEAKER_00]: wind just joking the answer is Okay,
jeopardy style what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Country is dark crystal glass cleaner made
in What country I'm looking for the
[SPEAKER_00]: country is If you can tell me the country
all melty heads Melty heads with the win
[SPEAKER_00]: melty heads with the win That's Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a feeling next melty heads one
already But hey, you know what if I ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys not to guess and you continue to
guess I'll just keep sending you shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: the people in the room can Can can either
let you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, please stop guessing or hey,
that's awesome that you've won nine times
[SPEAKER_00]: But today melty heads is the winner Canada
Canada is where that shit is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me an email melty heads with your
contact info BC bubble man at iCloud calm
[SPEAKER_00]: and Yeah, I said jeopardy style,
but I haven't watched jeopardy in like 18
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have cable TV and I don't watch
game shows So you'll have to deal with it
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it came out and in the meantime
maybe we will have a little rip Just
[SPEAKER_00]: because she's better at winning than you
I'll be more than happy to send it That's
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations to all those who have won
over the course of the last 40 or 50 days
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to be giving away one of Dana
Larson's books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll probably do that for Canada
Day July 1st He's got the cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cartoon I'm in it myself with my old
partners, but he's offered to give away a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of those books The only problem is
the reason I didn't give one away today is
[SPEAKER_00]: because I went to my bookshelf and I
couldn't find my copy He's going To be
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping it he's going to be signing it
but I wanted to still be able to hold one
[SPEAKER_00]: up and show it to you so I'm probably
gonna have to go see Dana in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of days and Get get a couple of his
copies of his books So I can show them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Elisode 73 yes, Elisode 73 will be coming
up in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a really kick-ass Elisode
I'm telling you they'll be nothing like
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some pretty greasy greasy right
there Nice color on that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ borderline orange Gang gang
bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up there Kelly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you YouTube has been acting weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the syrup?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know Michael M.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting for the syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting for the xylitol sugars I'm
waiting for the turps I'm waiting to
[SPEAKER_00]: support Blue River in any way shape or
form that I can and that's been a while
[SPEAKER_00]: since Blue River has Canada has ordered
anything new we still of course have of
[SPEAKER_00]: our absolutely fire sale on for those of
you $50 off each vial so if you buy three
[SPEAKER_00]: vials you get a hundred and fifty dollars
off your Your price and that's over at
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue River extracts.ca If you want to do
some wholesale if you're a company that
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to you know add You know create your
own pens or do a distillate mix or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever There's really no better company
than Blue River down in the US and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: hit them up at Blue River extracts calm
and I think they have an Email up there
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get in touch with Michael who's in
the chat room right now, and they'll hook
[SPEAKER_00]: you up with some wholesale action All
right, so let's do a little rip here shall
[SPEAKER_00]: we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a little rip maybe we'll have a
guest would you guys like to have a guest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to have someone just show
up here at my house and just be a guest on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could happen it could happen better turn
the other bong on just in case heard my
[SPEAKER_00]: dog bark and that's usually the Sign of a
guest making their way towards the studio
[SPEAKER_00]: now Who could it be who could my guest be
could it be my mother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be my wife?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know I don't know is it D420k?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know is it my mom should my mom
come and be on one of these shows Anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's hit this like a Toronto Rollo,
it's Batman It is Batman Tony yeah Tony
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony just flew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be awesome Be awesome to have any of
those guys show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have Ron show up Yeah,
all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you got your rigs ready We're ready
to wake the bake to bake the wake actually
[SPEAKER_00]: I Like to get the giveaway out of the way
I like to not be puffing ten bowls and
[SPEAKER_00]: then have to see who won I kind of like to
get it given away prior, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that I wouldn't consider it
[SPEAKER_00]: Tommy Chung is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have a relationship with him
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not quite sure that I would have the
ability to get him going that same way
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy Do you like bubblecaps You'll have
to be a little bit more What kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble cap are you referring to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this bubble cap you are referring
to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bon app√©tit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we have an episode of Hash Church
about the endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd probably have to invite some
people that are a lot more knowledgeable
[SPEAKER_00]: on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps it's a Dr. Bob Or a David Allen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always wanting to link with these guys
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy I invite David Allen on to
Hash Church weekly He doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have the proper computer to
connect
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we did lose the video Okay,
we're back not sure why we lost the video
[SPEAKER_00]: the connection says it's solid on my part
Hope everyone's doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always want to make sure that I'm not
wasting my time and talking to nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: What screen should I press Keef in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick with Terps I would say get some
screens that would allow you to clean the
[SPEAKER_00]: Keef I think the real valuable lesson is
in learning how to clean that sift and not
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the lazy man's way out and pressing
it into rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't get me wrong I love rosin and
it's wonderful and it's fun But don't you
[SPEAKER_00]: think you should have some of that sift
cleaned to a 99.9% degree so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually understand what the quality of
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh the bubble cap for the thermal banger I
don't personally have one but I've hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it I think thermal bangers are
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see myself getting one in the near
future But I'm not gonna run out and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to get one anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if it comes to me We'll see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't think that's bad Jordai your
system, you know Keep in mind the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system regulates
biological functions and taking a shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: eating are both biological functions So
the fact that you're regulating them with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis isn't overly surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't feel too bad about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real worry would be potentially being
away from cannabis and affecting your day
[SPEAKER_00]: by not being able to stimulate your
appetite and your bowels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest taking orally cannabis
extract in a coconut oil or something that
[SPEAKER_00]: is easy on your system that you can take
daily in micro doses building up to larger
[SPEAKER_00]: doses not necessarily for the effects but
for this system regulation that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little bit more above and beyond
maybe what you get from a dab or a puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always good to cover both bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puffing is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got us where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it's very important to
Oh, thank you melty heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got your your shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we'll give you a shout out
Scott Dunlop is in the room I want
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone to say what's up to Scott?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them some love show them that we're
good people in these waking banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're happy to give people shout outs
We're not here to bust on people's balls
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have a little bit of comedy here
and there and sometimes my sarcastic dry
[SPEAKER_00]: humor might offend you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Scott Dunlop and I hope
you're having a great day, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're having a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 143 people all thinking about you
all giving you the what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott Dizzle, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: What it is Scott wish it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is all we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the connection that people are
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be heard and they want to be
loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have that in common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that the guy who would
connect us through this interweb of
[SPEAKER_00]: connectivity Steve Jobs just happens to be
the person who is the most disconnected or
[SPEAKER_00]: was the most disconnected from his actual
family from his parents giving him up for
[SPEAKER_00]: adoption right up to him, you know in his
own words in his books not really
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizing the importance of spending
time with his children towards the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: his life and just making some bad
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so strange that he would be the
person that would set up this link that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone would connect through on these
computers and phones and in the meantime
[SPEAKER_00]: he was unable to create true meaningful
relationships outside of outside of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's going on big squirrel nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to say hi to big squirrel nuts
mostly just for his name alone,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the avatar also shows a dude that I
think I would get along with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picture me and big squirrel nuts having
a blast sitting by a fire doing some dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe heading off on some bikes afterwards
motorized ones, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, that's true Sal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello from San Diego, California mines
inclined saludos saludos Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's deep job was the only one linking
the chain of thousands who made the things
[SPEAKER_00]: and did the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll tell you squirrel testicles KTM
footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of KTM footage on my
website here YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the videos is called I
don't know if I named it Brom Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to go back and if you punch in
KTM dirt biking bubble man into Google,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should come up with the videos that I
have up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this may be kind of a dumb question,
but if bubble doesn't turn out as clean as
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best way to go about cleaning
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you use screens or just press it to
rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm not sure if what you're
talking about is actually cleanliness or
[SPEAKER_00]: quality because sometimes the quality is
not there and so even when you purify it
[SPEAKER_00]: to 99.9% heads it might come across as
dirty or not clean when really it's as
[SPEAKER_00]: clean as clean can be but the quality is
not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the other side of the coin where
the actual cleanliness has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: achieved, but that's rare especially if
it's water hash because water makes this
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a no-brainer everything sinks
everything floats head sinking everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else floating creating a transfer chamber
of sorts that really allows for almost
[SPEAKER_00]: even a monkey to be able to mix up a batch
I could come along and pull the bags and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would be isolated down near to 99.9%
now of course there are mistakes that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could make you could use too little of ice
you could over mix you could beat dry
[SPEAKER_00]: material into powder and have the little
pieces not have the proper amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area that would allow for it to
float in water and it'll be affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity and sink and contaminate your
final product but those are two very
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh is Jordai not being being a good dude
or what for a million dollars would you do
[SPEAKER_00]: a porno?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll put him in a we'll put him in
a timeout there for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's kind of the difference
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble hash water hash is almost a
no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make a very clean product
for you purity is what you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: with bubble hash dirtiness can be cleaned
over screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could rerun it through the bags and
float it in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There must have been a reason that you I
have tried CBD crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like crystalline?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea that crystalline in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can assume purity when I see a
crystalline structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why the people who are
growing the really beautiful crystals of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and THC are smashing them into powder
because once it's into the powder,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, we've seen a variety of
different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are almost yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some is like white white white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see it in the in the crystals
just because it implies purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning sun grown trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're having a great day blended in
first set of bubble bags in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God sir smokes a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a few of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you just blending and then
pouring the soup through and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering why did I do wrong and then also
maybe not the best material to you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's because I'll tell you the people who
have the best material their consciousness
[SPEAKER_00]: is already at a level where they know not
to throw that into a blender and zip it
[SPEAKER_00]: all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more like the fear and scarcity
mentality of I don't want to lose any and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning when people were first
putting their material into water and ice
[SPEAKER_00]: I can I can assure you they were tripping
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't think it was real and they
thought I'm going to lose a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would over mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some guys actually got an
outboard motor like an electric trolling
[SPEAKER_00]: motor to mix their material up with just
turned it into soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not the good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do it with a spoon and a lot of ice
and get just as beautiful of an extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: from both my yields and of course my
purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dabbing on reclaim that sounds
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you were luster burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how I felt the first time I threw
eight ounces of dry sift into into one any
[SPEAKER_00]: tips running 20 gallon bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know 20 gallon bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually when I run 20 gallon bags,
I run multiple sets of 20 gallon bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having all the bags inside of one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix in the machines, but I also use an
all screen to 20 bubble now bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of ice to make sure that the
temperature has been achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the most important factors
ice ice ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually melts in the mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you're hearing that
crushing of ice, you know that the that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's happening proper mixing trim versus
mixing bud is very different as you get
[SPEAKER_00]: larger amounts of bud or plant matter into
larger amounts of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to really be careful that you're
achieving your sweet spot in your
[SPEAKER_00]: threshing ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the threshing to be perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amount of water versus the amount
of plant matter and the plant matter
[SPEAKER_00]: variables are going to matter whether
they're thick strong buds, whether they're
[SPEAKER_00]: loose tiny little sugar leaves or a
mixture of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those these are more things that are very
difficult to teach and to put into words
[SPEAKER_00]: because they change much the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when we dry the resin and
depending on where you are, if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona or if you're in Washington,
those are two very different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's dry and arid and one's wet and
humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so drying the hash is going to be
different and then everything in between
[SPEAKER_00]: those two differences are also very little
bits and changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see there's certain things in
the water hashing process that it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like you have to learn by making little
mistakes and how you do it is you either
[SPEAKER_00]: go past or go under and then get closer
and closer and closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hone in on that sweet spot that is
going to be sitting in between your two
[SPEAKER_00]: points but I'm not exactly sure where it
will be sitting in between your two
[SPEAKER_00]: points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was some pretty good
information right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely you know that's the problem
with people trying to give advice on this
[SPEAKER_00]: hash making thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few points where you can take
the basics but once you get to the few
[SPEAKER_00]: points you have to really go and make your
own mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on Mitchell O'Brien.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad you're using those bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your weight for 20 gallons?
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually run 900 to 1000 grams after the
machine seems to be slowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah 900 grams dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4000 plus grams fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just all about your threshing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long you thresh for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we don't thresh trim as long as
we thresh bud for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim is very quick and I can wash trim in
one two three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One two three minute washes on really
tightly grown OGs or cookies is not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get a really small percentage of
something awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm more inclined to get the majority
of my yield in the highest purity that I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my first batch I don't want to be you
know going back and forth and having to
[SPEAKER_00]: run the material three or four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you don't over stack your bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over stack your bags the heads
aren't able to fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get captured in the material that's
plugging up the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to rewash multiple times
to get all the resin out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a couple at like a half pound
dry in that five gallon bubble washing
[SPEAKER_00]: machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paint stir is too aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Gary if you really have to do
something like that even a little cake
[SPEAKER_00]: mixer with the two little pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made fire bubble with those for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays I use the spoon because I can
really get around and move everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course the bubble now once I
saw the washing machines and how well they
[SPEAKER_00]: spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the fact that they spin everything
to the left and then they spin everything
[SPEAKER_00]: to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just continue to do that and
that's a really good process of having it
[SPEAKER_00]: go one way stop and go the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm certain that there's an enormous
amount of resin loss and falling happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in that process of where it turns and
stops and then starts going the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be some sort of force
that is felt in there and of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: ice smashing back and forth and the
glandular trichome heads being extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: brittle and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we gave a bottle away of DC cleaner
as it was made in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought that would be a real easy question
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will get that off to you Melty Heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sending me your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I now have like four or five packages once
again that I need to go send up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm probably going to go deal with this
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe going to put the boat in the water
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it all off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of interior work needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully my son can get down there and
clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise everyone have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go live from the boat later I will
see you then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise could you talk about the
difference between all the bag companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Bags, Bolt, Ice Trac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Bolt and Ice Trac came after Bubble
Bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe they have paid for
Reinhardt's patents so they would both be
[SPEAKER_00]: in the breach of patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't really know how much
they've been teaching everyone how to make
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble hash for the last 18 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that I'm a little bit higher on the
podium but the beautiful thing about being
[SPEAKER_00]: a customer is you yourself get to choose
who you want to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do support me I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't I'll still be here for
you when those companies are unable to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer the same level of customer service
that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need a question answered
whether you got Bolt Bags or Ice Extract
[SPEAKER_00]: Bags or whoever's bags I'm happy to help
you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want people making more water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up until the point that it actually
starts to affect my business I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be too worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you everybody for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk to you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: May the full melt bless your bowls sooner
than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Peace out.
Peace out.
