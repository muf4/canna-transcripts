[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world I
am sitting out on my deck today because
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first time in about a month It is
beautiful and I do mean beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just sitting out in the t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually t-shirt weather It's got to
be 12 to 15 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is in Fahrenheit,
but by all means Google it translated
[SPEAKER_00]: figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know probably not quite 70 Anyway,
I thought I was on my way home and I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: some beautiful waterfalls and some
beautiful ocean front and I saw Cypress
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain and I thought I need to make a
video I'd love to be hitting all these
[SPEAKER_00]: spots and of course, I didn't hit any of
those spots But here we are beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear the melt in the background
and you hear the water running Through the
[SPEAKER_00]: eaves drop system of the house tons of
snow Down in my front yard still but
[SPEAKER_00]: turning into liquid quickly So I of course
have the new mothership pickup give thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: to high integrity glass art for the drop
as always For all your mothership needs
[SPEAKER_00]: here in British Columbia beautiful little
You know sandblasted frosted if you will
[SPEAKER_00]: mini With the new style thick big
beefcake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh fz which fits on just beautifully
Smoking a little bit of MK ultra bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash from the West Coast concentrate boys
and I really like the base of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular rosin doesn't have a very like
overly strong flavor to it like sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: the MK ultra can very cushy So it's a good
base for me to be able to hit all these
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful terpenes that I have from Blue
River So a gift from Tony the lemon tree
[SPEAKER_00]: not carrying that one up on my website
unfortunately, but all the rest from the
[SPEAKER_00]: stardog to the Clementine to the Jack
Frost to the Tangy And we're on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: last two sunset sherbert and last but
certainly not least the three times crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is I think what we're gonna be
dipping right now a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: three times crazy Clean this dabber make
sure it's as clean as clean can be one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about the glass dabber Give it a
wipe each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any little microscopic hairs
Or remnants of anything that's non resin
[SPEAKER_00]: non glandular on the end of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So got a nice little dab here Get that
It's pretty cold out here So even bending
[SPEAKER_00]: this dab around the dabber and yes,
I will use my fingers because it is my dab
[SPEAKER_00]: After all don't need to have gloves for my
own dab get a nice big dip of the three
[SPEAKER_00]: times crazy on there We're gonna go to
town Get this up Get that open Get this
[SPEAKER_00]: torch going And as always what comes in
handy when you're using these courses a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people ask how long do you heat it
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know how long to heat it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just follow the time, you know I
heat it up for a certain amount of time
[SPEAKER_00]: with the torch and once it gets to that
time I stop I Think my torch might even be
[SPEAKER_00]: dying right now It's hard to tell yeah,
it's dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right I'll be right back All
[SPEAKER_00]: right, so we got the torch stopped and now
we're going to take a lovely lovely rip
[SPEAKER_00]: through this Frosted little mini it's got
a real nice hit to it I've hit it probably
[SPEAKER_00]: about a half a dozen times so far shared
it even on the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Just love the little size, you know 5.5
inches looks so nice in the Sun and just
[SPEAKER_00]: feels great You know like even between the
fingers it feels solid It's we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking today at the cchq when we had it
down We were hitting it without touching
[SPEAKER_00]: it and we realized that it doesn't even
really tip when you put your mouth onto it
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have much of a tip at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So It's pretty sweet pretty sweet All
right In the five seconds and we're good
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice puddling in effect there got a nice
puddle that rip And the beauty of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it really cleans nicely with the
q-tips and once you Yeah, once you get in
[SPEAKER_00]: there You can do a real nice job on
cleaning and that to me the you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole Not that I'm religious, but
cleanliness is godliness statement is
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat true to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your stuff clean much more enjoyable
Each rip give it a nice clean no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: who's hitting it always give a nice fresh
clean and I guess that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really wanted to share a bowl with
you guys share a little bit about a little
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sunshine and the view with you and
