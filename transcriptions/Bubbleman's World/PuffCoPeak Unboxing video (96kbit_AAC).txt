[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been a little MIA since the
Mallorca filming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to admit I've, you know,
a little bit nerve-wracked about some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the well-established cannabis-based
channels that have been deleted recently
[SPEAKER_00]: off of YouTube, making me very nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrible news about Raymold, the urban
grower, the PotTV lost theirs and some
[SPEAKER_00]: others, so I've just been really kind of
holding back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today I figured we would do a little
unboxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little treat in the mail here
and I thought this would be a good video
[SPEAKER_00]: to get up on the channel and let everyone
know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have got this from Puffco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puffco sent me a little
something-something, so I figured we will
[SPEAKER_00]: use the Happy Daddy dabber here to get
into the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see what's going on in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What wonderfulness have they sent me
today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at this point you guys even
probably know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing better than just opening the box
to actually find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to say this about these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came in like three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the time it was ordered, to the time
it was sent, to the time it arrived,
[SPEAKER_00]: was three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally ordered on this day,
sent on this day, received on this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Canada and this came from Valencia,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was pretty cool to be able to get
it that quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real quick and easy shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: A box within a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of bubble wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: My receipt here on the price of the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These go for $3.99 US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed it is the Puffco Peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been quite excited about grabbing
one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had tried just a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to try the unit and I was quite
impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've mentioned it before, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's really just gonna be the unboxing
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I can take a dab from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me to really try a unit,
I need to be able to take it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very portable unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm often carrying you know, my Mini,
the carb cap, the container, the dabber,
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes, the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like the compactedness of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's still going to be a pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going to be a dabber that needs
to fill and I'm still gonna need Q-tips
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm still gonna need the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really like the portability of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the cleanliness,
the lines of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much like receiving an Apple
product almost so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get out what you put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see what we've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, very, very nice, easy, intuitive
opening box there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does it say here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first word that I read on the inside
of the lid at the top there, intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got intuitive, powerful,
precise, portable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share the view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a video of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well I'm gonna do one better
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually gonna take this bad boy to
420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another beautiful just full box that comes
right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a couple of things in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the most awarded vaporizer ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's their little Puffco pen unit
that they've got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peak technology in a discrete size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used one of the Puffco pens and I
have to admit I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Alex gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave it to me years ago in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably one of their first units,
but I still have that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says nice little booklet that comes
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always nice to get a little booklet with
an explanation of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go, you're almost to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's a drag, but please read
through all the directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This device is the first of its kind and
we'd like you to learn the easy way by
[SPEAKER_00]: reading this booklet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn some secret tips and tricks
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got what's inside page three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a quick start page four to eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature settings on page nine,
battery on page nine, cleaning your device
[SPEAKER_00]: on page 10, advanced features on page 11,
a warning on page 11, and finally peak
[SPEAKER_00]: protection on page 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we go through the entire
little booklet here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breaking it down and showing each unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the loading tool,
the cotton swabs, the USB cable,
[SPEAKER_00]: the AC adapter, the glass attachment,
the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each glass piece is hand blown and made
very slightly in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atomizer cover, the ceramic bowl,
the atomizer, and the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically what you see on this
page right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those little units are right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one, fully charged device before
first use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna do that right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna fully charge this device
before first use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that a nice little unit right there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta say, they've had a real hype with
this unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can kind of see why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's your base right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got our atomizer in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our nice little glass top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, they've got a little cover on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little plastic cover, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unique holes that are gonna absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's the hole right there on the
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a nice little hole right on the
back of the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also explains, if I can get
that to you, how to line up the holes to
[SPEAKER_00]: fit this base.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very nice little base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feels like it's well made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna see, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels very thick and it feels just well
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not feel cheap whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This feels heavy, heavy, heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna read it before I start trying to
play around with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empty water before storing glass,
that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fits in so tightly as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really a fan of things that fit into
their case as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the little dabber that it comes
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got their own unique dabber that
comes with the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little scoop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also got our carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very tiny little carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not a big carb cap,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably just fits the unit to perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show all that here in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just read the booklet, shall we?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna fully charge the device
before first use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Device pulses white while charging and
turns off automatically when complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the, yeah, look at that right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll make sure that I've got all these
components back in here properly so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it sideways again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the base, this is the glass,
this is the carb cap, this is the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right in here, you've got your
cables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna pull those cables out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little charger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, take that plastic off right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and clean, seems like a nice,
quality charger there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feels good in the hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what else we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of cotton swabs that
they've given us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a small amount there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got also a ceramic dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if you use probably an extra one,
I'm guessing, as the unit did have one
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just check that out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got one inside of it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that just unscrews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I'm not gonna attempt to do
anything without reading it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's such a natural thing to
start playing with things and moving them
[SPEAKER_00]: and pulling them and twisting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a unit that I've never seen
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not just follow the instructions to
the tee?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice short little cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, another thing that people tend
to do is they'll see this universal plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although you might have many plugs
like this, what I suggest, and I do this
[SPEAKER_00]: based on my own pen, is use the one that
you got with the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my pen, for instance,
if you use a super, a fast charging from
[SPEAKER_00]: Samsung, which is the same plug,
it actually will blow out the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna blow it up, but it'll burn
out the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just won't work properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm always letting people know
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charger's right on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: The charge hole's right on the front of
the unit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm gonna charge this little bad
boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll just plug it in right here
into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice little charger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna flip open the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip that box upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a perfect table for the charger.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is indeed flashing white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going real slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real slow pulsating white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then off.
[SPEAKER_00]: White and then off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's read the rest of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step two after fully charging is fill
glass with water just above the air holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not fill glass while attached to the
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not allow water in lower sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pretty important factor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the unit right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I could pull off the plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says align air hole with atomizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that comes off real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I'll show you that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your hole right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're gonna line that up properly
when we when we put this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously we don't want to get water
inside this lower chamber because it could
[SPEAKER_00]: come right out this hole, drip into your
atomizer or drip into your battery base
[SPEAKER_00]: and probably cause some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll follow those instructions really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how we're supposed to fill it
up with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope I'm not going too fast for anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully push glass into the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Align inlet holes on the front of the
glass with atomizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step four.
[SPEAKER_00]: To lock and unlock the device,
hold down the button for three seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you click this glass piece into the
base, I guess you can push the button and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll push a little piece out that keeps
it locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single click to toggle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the pictures of those as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we are putting it into the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are holding the button down to get
it to lock into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to single click to toggle
through the heat settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blue is a small load.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green light is a medium load.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be about 500 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red is a large load and that's 550
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually what I hit my hopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popbox D-nail dabinator at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then white XL load is a 600 degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see those right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the settings right here for the
puff coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then step six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use loading tool to place contents on the
bottom surface of the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's pretty self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your dab and drop it into your little
atomizer base there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go step seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it kind of is unique in the
sense place the carb cap on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: atomizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often people will put their dab in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start hitting it while they're
putting the dab in and then they'll put
[SPEAKER_00]: the carb cap on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is load it, put the carb cap on and
then start hitting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not right away because we're going to
get the heat to initialize and that's step
[SPEAKER_00]: eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we do is we double click to
initiate the heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about a 20 second average heat up
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press and hold the button any time to
exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulsing light indicates heat up mode is
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the color that you chose
in step five, which are the single click
[SPEAKER_00]: to toggle through heat settings,
one is blue, two is green, three is red,
[SPEAKER_00]: four is white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go back and then you engage it
once you've loaded your hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we choose our heat settings,
it's not actually engaging the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't engage the heat until we put the
hit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very different from dabbing
where we heat the quartz up and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: drop it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard some people complain about,
oh, well, I don't want my rip heating up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bowl while it's, you know,
like while, I don't want it in there while
[SPEAKER_00]: it's heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, trust me, I've hit this thing
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to make a difference,
especially with turp dipping, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: with high grade materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus you've got your carb cap on top and
it's not going to be releasing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that may evaporate into the
air and start vaporizing, it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: trapped in that bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still going to get that flavor and
that taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step nine, device will vibrate and lights
will flash when ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inhale repeatedly until device is finished
producing vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: See page 11 for sesh mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sesh mode obviously is a mode where you're
not going to have to heat it up every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we're going to get there soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already on page eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Page number 10, once you're done,
use a cotton swab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help to clean the chamber after
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all pretty self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys all know how to clean a
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be different because your
unit's not going to vibrate and flash
[SPEAKER_00]: lights when it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a nice little page on your
temperature settings as well as your
[SPEAKER_00]: battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cycling through the four temperature
settings, click the button once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low is a small load, 450, 20 second heat
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medium is a medium load, 500 degrees,
20 second heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: High is a large load, 550 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 25 second heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the peak, the XL load, the one that a
lot of people are probably going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: using is a 600 degree and that's 25
seconds to heat up as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that up in the top corner
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got your battery
percentages there from 100 to 60%,
[SPEAKER_00]: from 60 to 30 and from 15 to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So click the button three times to check
battery life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color will indicate remaining battery
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you click it three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's green, you've got between 60 and
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's yellow, you've got between 30 and
60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's red, obviously that's time to
get a charge in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, cleaning, it's breaking it down
right here on how simple the unit from the
[SPEAKER_00]: carb cap to the cover to the little
ceramic dish to the atomizer, all
[SPEAKER_00]: unscrewed from the unit as well as the
glass being removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preparation, remove glass before
unscrewing and reinserting atomizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't over tighten the atomizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your carb cap glass and atomizer by
soaking in isopropanol alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing I could also probably use my
DC glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna check with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I can for the carb cap and the
glass, but we'll find out about the
[SPEAKER_00]: atomizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it can be cleaned fully assembled
or disassembled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, be sure to clean gold
connector on base and bottom of atomizer
[SPEAKER_00]: with an alcohol soaked cotton swab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna find out as well if I can use
the DC glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: DC glass cleaner for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three is a warning after cleaning
rinse and allow all parts to dry before
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna be pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously different liquids are not safe
to use when electrical currents are
[SPEAKER_00]: flowing through when batteries are being
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wanna make sure things are really
dry once you start getting going again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, before removing the atomizer,
make sure bowl has cooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not get the base wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's electric, it will break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thoroughly clean device after every 20
uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got advanced features.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna cover the advanced features really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sesh mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I think we're gonna
be using here at Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sesh mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't reached your peak?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got you covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created a sesh mode that increases heat
and extends your session by 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use it to boost heat or to share with your
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If vapor production is low, double click
to initiate sesh mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still not enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn your hardcore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sesh again, you can double click as many
times as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep the session going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got a whole variety of
warnings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might as well go through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multi-colored light flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there is poor or no connection
between the base and the atomizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see a rainbow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five red light flashes indicates a short
circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red light holds means the device has
overheated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're probably gonna end up seeing
that at one point in time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basic things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not allow water in the bottom chamber
of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not let water seep into the atomizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not overfill glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not store device with water in the
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove glass before unscrewing and
inserting atomizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attach, detach glass carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait one minute between uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not fire atomizer four times
consecutively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several short inhales produce more vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not place contents on the sidewalls of
the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not overfill chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you experience a bug, turn the device
on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should the issue persist, contact support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep away from extreme hot and cold
temperatures and keep away from moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: and high heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if more people read those simple
warnings, those simple, that simple list,
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you nine out of 10 times this unit
fucks up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon my French.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have not listened to these simple,
very, very simple rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be like, well, I didn't know I
shouldn't fire the atomizer four times
[SPEAKER_00]: consecutively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you read the instruction booklet,
it would actually tell you that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're not supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, yeah, they wanna make sure we
have a consistently perfect experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should something go wrong, visit puffco
.com to view the FAQs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your questions might be covered there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you can live chat with a
specialist on our site or contact customer
[SPEAKER_00]: care at support at puffco.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sweet little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna let it heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, not heat up, but charge up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it's fully charged, we're gonna
come back and we're gonna do a little
[SPEAKER_00]: session and we're gonna see how well this
thing rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're back here, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably notice that my head and
shoulders are missing, but I kinda took a
[SPEAKER_00]: little page out of Sneaky Pete's vaporizer
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the way his was tied up and
close, and that's how we're gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my little unit all charged up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess we'll just follow the booklet
real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna hold the button to lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I held that down for three
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did a little vibration, so I'm guessing
it's locked down now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single clicks to toggle through the
settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, that's green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, we're on red already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for large.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll set it at large.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a red light that goes all the
way across the sides here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just turned off, actually, but the way
the light lit up was very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, load the surface to place a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna grab our tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do a little turp dip,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some nice material here that we're
gonna load up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too too much, but at least a decent
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's get that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get my second tool here so I can get
it off nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it said, not to just leave it on the
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, fell in perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Place the carb cap on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the loading tool to place contents
on the bottom surface of the bowl,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will place our carb cap on the top
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then double click to initiate heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go one, two.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's gonna initiate our
heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait about 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulsating light indicates heat up mode is
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, pretty excited about this
little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not turned it on yet, so let's try
that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please carb cap double click to initiate
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go one, two.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give that another shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, it's starting to pulsate now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light has turned on this time,
my bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different way of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll probably get quite used to it
once I've got the timeline down and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how the unit heats up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking for that pulsating light to let me
know it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not heating up,
so I'm gonna try and figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that was a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always about the learning curve on
these units.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pushing it and then pushing it,
and this time I went click, click.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit different, and it's
pulsating, so here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third time's the charm on that,
I'll tell ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really nice flavor on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I turp dipped it, but that was
tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three good size rips so far from something
that would normally just give me a single
[SPEAKER_00]: dab off my nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you a little see inside the unit
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a little bit at first
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be honest though, I'm not going
to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it took me a couple of times to get
it right, and it was the simpleness Let me
[SPEAKER_00]: just give that a nice little clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the straight, the pointy ones as
well, which is great to get into those
[SPEAKER_00]: corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she is as clean as a whistle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great little unit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pufco Peak, medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take one more dab this time with
the camera a little further back so you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, that was really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're gonna give one more shot
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab another little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time I'm gonna dip, that time I
dipped it into the ACDC, and this time I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to dip it into the Gills Lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see if we can't get that
happening real nice and fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little bit of Gills Lemons in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick little drop into the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely having two dabbers I think is
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting it in proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we'll hit that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much quicker on the double, and I can see
the light on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it all the way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what happens is once it
reaches temperature, it's going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: the light's gonna pulsate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only takes about 20 seconds,
and you're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to hitting the Gills
Lemons and the CBD Isolate on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like my dog wants a little rip
right now, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that was a great little review of
the Pufco Peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really wonderful little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take it to 420 in a couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna hit it with a bunch of my
friends and we'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far with the first few rips,
I have to say I'm very impressed with this
[SPEAKER_00]: little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fits right in the palm of your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw there was a little bit of a
learning curve there as I tapped it slow
[SPEAKER_00]: the first few times, but definitely
impressed with that unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot Pufco.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time on Bubble Man's
World.
Bye for now.
Ssssssssssssssss.
Ssssssssssss.
Ssssssssssss.
