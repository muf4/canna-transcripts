because let's be honest We're only gonna
[SPEAKER_13]: have so much time before we get up to
mid-station.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right if we have a full-blown giant
pipe sticking out of my Gondola while we
[SPEAKER_13]: get up there I mean we do like to respect
Whistler black home, you know to a degree
[SPEAKER_13]: they have to agree They have some pretty
good rules that are worth following safety
[SPEAKER_13]: things and such safety first safety first,
but at the same time We're not gonna not
[SPEAKER_13]: enjoy a little puff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, let's be realistic.

[SPEAKER_13]: How about the base on my pipe right now?
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, it's wicked.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's full of snow.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a snow base.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the snow hitting.

there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ten-cent snow base.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Whistler Mountain, I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is one of my favorite places in the
world to be.
[SPEAKER_13]: Both in the backcountry and right on the
runs.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there's a whole family of people
coming down right now.

[SPEAKER_15]: And you're there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's see if I can get this done.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just pushing through, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like, just on the cusp, hanging by a
thread.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, as long as we have some gas in this
torch, we'll be able to bang it up all
[SPEAKER_13]: over this mountain.
[SPEAKER_13]: Once it's done, it's done.
[SPEAKER_13]: That'll be the end of Puff Wednesday,
but we got a bunch more runs in this,
[SPEAKER_13]: that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Opening day, yay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty stoked, I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, the pow is like, it's great right
now.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's November 23rd.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, just, you know how often I've been
in Amsterdam during this time?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm always in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm always in Amsterdam, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: But not today.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not today.
[SPEAKER_15]: And can you imagine, like, if you were the
guys that stayed in line earlier this
[SPEAKER_15]: morning and you had these first runs down
here, the silky white ribbons.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it was good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, it's deep.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's deep for opening day.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of exposure, but it's deep.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you had the first rips down,
like, cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were good.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were great, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, our rips were great.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was totally great.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were, you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's still gonna be great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Three hours in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's still snowing, so.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's supposed to get seven
centimeters tomorrow, but then it's like a
[SPEAKER_13]: 15 to 20, a 10 to 15, and a 15 to 20.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then sunshine on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_13]: If those hit for us, well, we'll all be
pretty happy campers.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're laughing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's make sure we don't give you the
hot rip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now it's very hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're probably gonna.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we're gonna let it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna let a couple of snowflakes
fall into the banger.
[SPEAKER_13]: Haven't seen one yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: You suck, bro.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, like, what the.
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't come here to catch snowflakes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I came here to shred it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we are.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's rip it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice little rip for pate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking delicious, right?
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dropping porches in the snow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, delicious.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you're done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Holy, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ripping that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You just stick that right in the snow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Quartz.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thermal shock.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't try that with glass.
[SPEAKER_13]: It will explode.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so you want to get ripping?
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get ripping, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get ripping.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe during the sun hyzer?
[SPEAKER_12]: Marcus.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a place just on the other street
in the lower there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, OK, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely probably have, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You ride dirt bikes up there, too?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, when I got one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were just talking about KTMs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's universal.
[SPEAKER_13]: They've got a pretty nice electric one
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get my bag here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping to save enough money for
something like that, but the winter came,
[SPEAKER_12]: and here we are.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm under it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah?
[SPEAKER_16]: They lifted.
[SPEAKER_16]: All good?
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not under the party bar anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: First day shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you guys know it's Puff Wednesday
today?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's Puff Wednesday today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Got to do a lot of puffing today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at these tracks.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really like an accurate name for
lower insanity.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fucking Quebecois right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck, fuck, do you hear?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to record the sound.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking rock skis.
[SPEAKER_09]: First track sound fucking insanity,
though.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Done it many a times.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just so much more fun when there's
snow, like lots.
[SPEAKER_13]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially when you're riding a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Get my backpack on my back.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you saying?
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not cruising super fast,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, buddy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Take it easy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Want to head over to Sepo's?
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Ethan said he'd keep going if you want.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can go in for a quick sec.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: Any little bit that I can show.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Please don't hit me.
[SPEAKER_12]: In the jungle.
[SPEAKER_13]: I keep thinking everyone's Ethan.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of tripping me out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like that was the third dude I thought.
[SPEAKER_12]: It happened to me with Devon, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where you put your board?
[SPEAKER_02]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bring it up and put it next to the sign
that says don't leave your board here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fog the bitch up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it takes a second to get.
See
[SPEAKER_11]: you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_11]: See you on Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, first day of whisk.
[SPEAKER_05]: So stoked.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys got salmon burgers?
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I'll do a salmon burger.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're killing it, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You gave me the extra time to film that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Tom, from Adelaide.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm fucking up my
[SPEAKER_13]: shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this one?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, push that little blue button.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's real clear right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: My camera, look.
[SPEAKER_13]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: It cleared up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Patty in the background, like,
photobombing you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like your sleekness.
[SPEAKER_13]: You look very like.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's time to get back out on the mountain
for more Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: We hit now, boys?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go hit the spot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go hit the smokes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go do it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny's back behind the bar.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like we're getting back.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great opening day, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Got it done.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all grown up.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all grown up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we're heading out, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to the front.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to the front line.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's grab the custom board
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: To the custom board.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to have a good time, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mildly tripping me out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go, dudes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see what's in my backpack.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold up.
[SPEAKER_12]: This was awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rat Fink, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took a header.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, you look so proud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took a header.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right down my neck.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Peek-a-peek.
[SPEAKER_12]: Peek-a-peeky.
[SPEAKER_12]: Peek-a-peek.
[SPEAKER_12]: Holy shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Found some tasty treats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love fucking Rat Fink.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a full zone, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at all to the right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, when it's fresh, pal, and you just
come right here in the morning before a
[SPEAKER_03]: peak opens, it's fucking fantastic.
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you doing right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, brother.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we shall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_12]: How was that, eh?
[SPEAKER_12]: That was fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to have to unhook to get over
there, I think.
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we just keep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got that quickness with the shuffle.
Skis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this our sesh spot?
[SPEAKER_13]: It can be, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it should be.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy right before.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's our spot.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pop fucking Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm filming right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully it'll get the job done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Under the bridge here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some rishishi?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a blowtorch, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't be the only one that brought my
bong up here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does this one explode too?
[SPEAKER_10]: Not the only one.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have four G's for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have some hash in there too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's got water?
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_13]: We just poured it out for the beer.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some right here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's too dirty.
[SPEAKER_13]: That water's too dirty.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we're hitting dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lighter would have worked.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's dabbing, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: You hit the bowl as hot as the glass will
make it, and then you just drop your shit
[SPEAKER_10]: on top of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus we got a halogen with some zepplos
beer.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's imported from zepplos.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to lick this fella up.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is bubble mark.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bubble man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Vast that holds all this shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is true, this is true.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are family men, by the way.
[SPEAKER_10]: They all have kids and babies and shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well babies have endocannabinoid
systems.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course they do.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were born with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mine's too now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also have a federal license from the
government to possess, grow, and process
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis resins.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I like to use the opportunity as often
as I can to help normalize cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, but can you do it on a plane?
[SPEAKER_12]: I do it on the plane all the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not this extreme, I'll admit, but... You
still got to go to the bathroom for it,
[SPEAKER_13]: or can you just like rip it off?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I sit in my seat.
[SPEAKER_13]: Does anyone want one of these?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll do a mini though.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can do it at the end too, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, we'll get you sorted out
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, it is mixed bubbles, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: God damn it, it feels good to be up here
again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I really agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a whole year off.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_11]: A whole year off for you too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I was sledding and doing backcountry
stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, a whole year off from here,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was weird.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like when I would try to feel like
nostalgic and bad about it, I'd be like
[SPEAKER_13]: over on like, Tricone or something,
and it would just be five feet deep.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, this is pretty good,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey man, could you promise me something
that if you ever forget your transceiver,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're not gonna fucking turn your sled
on?
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, I wouldn't go, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even really like going with people
that have working transceivers,
[SPEAKER_13]: but don't know how to use them.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, you're the guy that's supposed
to save my life, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like it's just really simple, if you can't
figure it out, go practice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even mind practicing on a great
day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, fuck.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to check the snow anyway.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you turn it on?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I put it in a Ziploc baggie and I didn't
turn it on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gone.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so I'm going to the lift.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a good, I keep thinking about the
fucking.
[SPEAKER_10]: Torch rips.
[SPEAKER_12]: Torch rips.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can move over actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all like kind of half in,
half out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those that want to be out, stay out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ethan's right on the edge of being in.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's on the fence, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: On the fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all facing the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you call undecided.
[SPEAKER_02]: Backed up.
[SPEAKER_13]: This should be a service that Whistler
offers.
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like I'm getting serviced right
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you should apply for the job.
[SPEAKER_13]: They just roll down on skis, it's like,
oh shit, it's the bomb rip dudes.
[SPEAKER_13]: How's your day?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey guys, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the pow rip dudes.
[SPEAKER_13]: They give us the recipe.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what we're hitting today.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's plenty for pate.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a good idea to get you to hold
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: While you're almost dying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I got this.
[SPEAKER_10]: What color are your eyes right now?
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't see till it's red, dude,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Time to open another batch of resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_13]: This one's good.
[SPEAKER_13]: This one's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're done, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm good, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want a hand off or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: A hand job?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a married man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand off, son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_13]: First he's saying, hey, there's family men
here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want a hand job?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, hey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're a family man, I know what
it's like, you're lonely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm lonely.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you though, like one puff on
this thing is literally like hitting an
[SPEAKER_13]: entire joint to your head.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to ride really nice with my
spaghetti first day legs.
[SPEAKER_10]: No seizures allowed by the way.
[SPEAKER_10]: No seizures?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like seizures.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love seizures.
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely be a scary place to have one
though, just snowboarding down the
[SPEAKER_11]: mountain.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've already had a couple seizures here,
it's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it just comes on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've watched people just collapse and just
start having these.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all different for different people.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some pretty bad forms.
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes a lot of like flashing bright
lights, especially while playing wiffle
[SPEAKER_10]: golf.
[SPEAKER_11]: Video games.
[SPEAKER_10]: Text messages.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the dark.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you get that text?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It took me five hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've leaped out for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Who is up next?
[SPEAKER_13]: You up, Ethan?
[SPEAKER_10]: The BC fucking weed team right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Doing it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Ethan with the low temp, perfect dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the best dab I gave out.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we all got a right switch.
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean you already weren't?
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark, that makes it more difficult for
you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've only seen some of those guys ripping
pretty fast backwards.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, I just watched fourth phase.
[SPEAKER_10]: Un-fucking-believable.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like right up there with the,
that's it, that's all when it came out.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the equivalent of that next level of
like, guess what?
[SPEAKER_10]: And still my favorite has always been
until I've seen that one, fucking art of
[SPEAKER_10]: flight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Art of flight, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking art of stretching.
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: That guy's muscle structure around his
fucking abdomen and torso is fucking off
[SPEAKER_10]: the chart.
[SPEAKER_10]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because of the shit that he does,
he has built up his core muscles within
[SPEAKER_10]: his body to the point where they're
fucking three times the size of any normal
[SPEAKER_10]: fucking human.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole concept of following the system
is next level, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like really even picking up from
where Jeremy Jones left off.
[SPEAKER_10]: But even in a fucking more flamboyant,
awesome fashion.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially all those guys with maniacs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jeremy Jones seems more like at the end of
the day, he would just like go out and
[SPEAKER_13]: like eat some soup and call his wife and
kids and then go to bed.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, yeah, no Tomahawk scenes with
Jeremy Jones.
[SPEAKER_13]: He probably did exactly that.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_13]: He probably did exactly that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where those other guys are like,
hey, we should go blow off the propane
[SPEAKER_13]: tanks in the bush with the shotguns.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's after three weeks of not having any
fucking smoke.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'd pretty much rather maybe go with
them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's up on this?
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just make sure it's not too hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to give you the scolding hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Little bit of sizzle with that water in
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's snowy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Little snow sizzles.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice hit in the tourist drive too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what you call it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's a recycler.
[SPEAKER_13]: It goes through here, it goes up this
chamber and it spins in this wine glass
[SPEAKER_10]: and then it comes right back down.
[SPEAKER_10]: What a neat design, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just being shy about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, of course.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, we're rocking until it's over.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, don't go that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not the way you want to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you guys been here before?
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't go there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's what we're doing,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 250.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh no, that's never going to heat.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my God, look at that.
[SPEAKER_13]: The torch lit without the, you're blessed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thing hasn't lit once all day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably hot, hot now though.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe my lighter was still lit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was, but still.
[SPEAKER_13]: Usually you have to put the lighter so
close to it to get it to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe all the heat within it just kind of
like brought it in.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got the torch blessing today.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, last year I got 50 bucks on
opening day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today I'm getting fucking really good
fucking stone.
[SPEAKER_10]: 50 bucks, huh?
[SPEAKER_10]: How did that work out?
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the 50th year for the mountain to
be open.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first 50 people, like Creekside got
$50 gifts or $10 gifts.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking right, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: You were right in line.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was like six.
[SPEAKER_10]: Top 10?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get this in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty good stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's consumption.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thanks everyone for your patience,
letting that puff Wednesday mountain
[SPEAKER_13]: session happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a thought, eh?
[SPEAKER_10]: You get the whole world stoned at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder what the hell you could
accomplish.
[SPEAKER_10]: You would not believe what I accomplished.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stoned.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry, I can fucking learn how to
new guitar riff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause after getting really, really,
really stoned.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_10]: So actually you're working out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about working out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like at a gym.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little different.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we're going to get going here,
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a dab a do time, time a dab in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab, dab a dab a dab

[SPEAKER_06]: It's a dab a do time, a dab a do time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fresh from the extractor.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100% pure ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a smoke, it's a vapor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clean and pretty like gold.
[SPEAKER_06]: The amount of use this good for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just been enfold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for the young and the old.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab a dab a dab in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a dabba doo time, dabba doo time,

[SPEAKER_06]: Dab, dab, dab, dab, dabba dabba dabba

[SPEAKER_06]: It's a dabba doo time, dabba doo time,

[SPEAKER_06]: Dabbing in the morning, dabbing in the
evening, dabbing at supper time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabbing when you're weary, dabbing when
you're lonely, dabbing cause we're feeling
[SPEAKER_06]: fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people ask me what is dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to show you my dabbing machine
that my virgin bubble man bring in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab, dab, dab, dab, dabba dabba dabba
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a dabba doo time, dabba doo time,
time for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab, dab, dab, dab, dabba dabba dabba

[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good one, Tim.
[SPEAKER_13]: Peak to peak.
[SPEAKER_13]: Always smiles up on the mountain,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the big crew now.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got Jordan with us.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got Rob.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got Ethan.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where'd Ethan go?
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, there he is.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's out there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we go to the bottom there?
[SPEAKER_13]: We can go to the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_13]: What?
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to go back.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you guys serious?
[SPEAKER_13]: Take her seriously first.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm definitely going down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clothes from the bottom of the knee to the
mid-station.
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're okay skiing down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we go ahead?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But thank you for caring and looking out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all take care of each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Rob.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're all together.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we can go have some lunch.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not newbies is all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cowboy Bob pulling a fucking 360 right out
of the gate.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually two 180s, but that counts,
dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: Groomers for the win.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty damn sweet puff Wednesday with the
bubble man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad you guys were able to join me up
on Whistler.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been pretty sweet hanging out with
you guys with all my mountain friends.
[SPEAKER_13]: Looks like we're going into the back
country here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Out of bounds, I should say.
Oh
yeah, baby.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, fucking
[SPEAKER_15]: right.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's even more awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well we made it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're filming.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're live and direct back in the gondola
with Jordan and Patty.
[SPEAKER_13]: Gondola.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes, the gondola.
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully we can get a little nice rip
each, if I can maintain and find all my
[SPEAKER_13]: dappers.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's never easy, is it?
[SPEAKER_13]: You gotta make her a quick one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, by the time I get all this shit
going, the door will open.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta be 007 on that shit right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bond.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh no, this part, remember?
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to do that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Just heat those brown spots up about like
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to have to move it around a
little bit here and there, but just got
[SPEAKER_13]: them right to work on the torch,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, wait, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_13]: What am I doing here?
[SPEAKER_13]: Here, hold some nice flame, please.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just hold this.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's burning hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_13]: The trick is that this hash, this oil,
has become so cold.
[SPEAKER_13]: That it's very hard to just pull a single
dab off of the... That's going to be a
[SPEAKER_13]: nice one though, right there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice dabs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a nice dab right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dabsies.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dabsies.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very dark.
[SPEAKER_13]: See if we can clean that screen up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit anyway.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't you do the killer job?
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we'll just hit this on the off.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold it because this is still hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then I just have to find the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_13]: How close are we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty close, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting there, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys probably have time for a quick
rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll share this one.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll share this one with you.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to hold the pipe for a second?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to hit the first one that you
hold it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you get with the XL bowl.
[SPEAKER_13]: You get to hit two bowls in one shot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we got some snow in here.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can just put some snow inside the
banger.
[SPEAKER_13]: A little chiller.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get that all boiled up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cools the banger down so we can actually
put it away without burning up the place.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I know you're good with your beer
pad, eh?
[SPEAKER_13]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll hit you with a rip in the next shot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm good, buddy.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're never good.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's never over.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, just saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have smoked more today than we've ever
seen you smoke in your history of knowing
[SPEAKER_13]: you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was trying to think of how long I've
known you today, but it's definitely been
[SPEAKER_13]: like 15 years or something, no?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yes, here we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Getting everything put away in time to
land.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome, boys.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a stellar day.
[SPEAKER_13]: A great success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_13]: So much, so much, so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're going to go sit there and have
a beer right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that concludes the snowboard part of
Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to head over to my friend Ryan's
house, who I was supposed to puff with
[SPEAKER_13]: this morning, actually, who is Ethan's
brother from earlier.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm going to go finish the Puff
Wednesday with him and have a couple of
[SPEAKER_13]: puffs with him.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what we're going to do now.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, so Patty's going to go and head
out.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a great day, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Puff Wednesday was awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: More times with Patty up on the mountain
this winter.
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll definitely see more of him.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm going to go hook up with Ryan.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, couldn't have asked for a better
day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: We made it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I made it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll take off my neckie, actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here with my good friend Ryan,
who was supposed to meet me up on the
[SPEAKER_13]: mountain today.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a pow day.
[SPEAKER_13]: No friends.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty much.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was up in line at 630 or 6 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, something around there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, we're just going to finish it off
here in his cozy creekside pad.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thought I'd come by and offer a couple of
dabs up to him, because while he had great
[SPEAKER_13]: powder today, but I doubt that he had
great dabs.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's get you a great dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's hope for the torch.
[SPEAKER_13]: This torch was giving us a hell of a time
on the mountain today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Trying to start it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just like, it'd get cold and the
little flint inside would no longer flint.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we were using lighters.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to light the gas?
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to get it lit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the clicking was doing nothing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Click, click, click, click.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also didn't have water in the pipe
all day.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we hit it dry the entire day.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is my first session with this
pipe.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've been puffing out of it since this
morning with Patty.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually got Patty doing some good dabs
today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: All I had to do was put a couple of pints
in him before 10.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good experiment for mountain practical dab
gear.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I'm feeling.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I definitely don't feel that it,
you know, hinders me in any way.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a little dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: I sit for five or 10 minutes and then I
just get out into the snow and it just
[SPEAKER_13]: feels like pretty much the greatest thing
ever.
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that about how you see it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here, this one's going to be yours,
bud.
[SPEAKER_13]: All about the greatest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we're going to wait about 20
seconds or 30 seconds until that quartz
[SPEAKER_13]: cools down.
[SPEAKER_13]: On the mountain, it was also giving me a
hard time because the quartz would take on
[SPEAKER_13]: the cold of outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd be torturing it thinking I was
heating it up and then I'd go to put the
[SPEAKER_13]: oil in and it wouldn't even like melt.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was like, damn, I think I need to,
and of course at one point we had like six
[SPEAKER_13]: people waiting for the dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all like, oh my, and this thing's
like click, click, click, click,
[SPEAKER_13]: click, but not lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty fucking ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big one, medium one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: He says, whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: A little carb cap action right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So nice to cruise around Whistler and be
able to blaze my buddies down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Truly, truly nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: The carb cap worked damn fine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Put that there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get my Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_13]: Make sure I got those Q-tips, which clean
the bowl real nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: And relax.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good dab.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, good day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing wrong with that at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's been, well, how long have
you been living up in Whist for now?
[SPEAKER_13]: Almost 10 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: And think of how many of those years were
30 foot years that went into 40 that went
[SPEAKER_13]: into 50.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was only probably about three years.
[SPEAKER_13]: Last year was good, not great.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd say the first four I was here
probably, maybe even five.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're borderline epic.
[SPEAKER_14]: 50 footers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we had the last three.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Were not so awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Last year started to try a little harder,
but still only got us into like,
[SPEAKER_13]: it was just a couple of storms.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_14]: We really are.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have that weather pattern like it
was when I first got here where it's rainy
[SPEAKER_14]: all summer and that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Instead of it being hot.
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully that will happen exactly like
it did before and fill the valley in with
[SPEAKER_14]: snow.
[SPEAKER_14]: One can only hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little OG Kush turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to give you a turp
dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll have to have one.
[SPEAKER_13]: On your next rip.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Turp dip bone rip.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So watch the weather report too much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just going to look out the window.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well that's, you know, and my weather
report is going to be hitting you guys up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is, uh, thank God when the snow
falls.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause it's when you guys actually wake up
early enough that I can hit you up and not
[SPEAKER_13]: worry that I'm, uh, like this morning,
this morning where you were just gone when
[SPEAKER_13]: I was hitting you up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, you were already in line for two
hours.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was already on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard people lined up last night.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: People were definitely, I think there were
some people even at Creekside,
[SPEAKER_14]: but people would have been at the,
uh, the Whistler one for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Quite a few.
[SPEAKER_14]: A day or two before.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently started, they were there for
about 12 hours last night.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: All the way through.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've done that a few times.
[SPEAKER_13]: You gotta love the commitment.
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen, what you guys used to do was
beyond cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually hiking the mountain.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sleeping overnight.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like to me that's.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then getting a peek.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of some of the shit that is
special that I hope to never see leave
[SPEAKER_13]: Whistler because that's the roots.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the culture.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's like what makes Whistler special.
[SPEAKER_13]: And sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also like, Oh, you could get in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you could have your, I mean,
yeah, of course, but it's not like what
[SPEAKER_13]: you guys are doing is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's just a really cool thing that
I've always thought was pretty much epic
[SPEAKER_13]: climbing the mountain before it opens and
just the next day waking up and rolling
[SPEAKER_13]: down like first tracks that is.
[SPEAKER_14]: See the sunset or sunrise up there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause like I said, I've never,
I've never had that experience.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dab stuck on me here somehow.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to do a little doubler.
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you think of that dab?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Felt pretty iry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in a good place.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: You seem like you're in a good place.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm stoked to be riding with you and your
bros this winter.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_13]: It absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_13]: I took the year off last year from
Whistler.
[SPEAKER_13]: Only did back country.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did sprout and brand new wine.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did dracone.
[SPEAKER_13]: I missed out on Rutherford last year,
but did some other good spots,
[SPEAKER_13]: brome and whatnot, but never got up
Whistler mountain one time last year.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was surprised that your bro was back
home right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was kind of surprised that he wasn't,
you know, no, he was going to go back one
[SPEAKER_14]: way or another for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll do it right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: The beginning of season.
[SPEAKER_14]: Totally true.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot believe the heat retention this
thing is.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a perfect low temp hit.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can see it puddling in there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you still fishing then all the way
through winter or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not as much though, because we just
haven't had most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, you were getting a lot of fishing
in.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good living up here in Whist,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: To do all the good things.
[SPEAKER_13]: I checked out your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, this motherfucker is pulling
fish out of the rivers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, you look pretty stoked when you're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You go up there alone or?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get you more bait.
[SPEAKER_13]: See if we can't get you really even
talking more than you're currently
[SPEAKER_13]: talking.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll take a back to back.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been doing this all day.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been puff Wednesday, so it's been a
lot of going out and destroying everyone,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had some characters with us for a while
today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Met some random people on the gondola that
puffed with us, like right out of the
[SPEAKER_13]: pipe, dabs full like, yeah, pull out that
pipe and let's do it down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Which was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always nice to bump into the
like-minded folks.
[SPEAKER_13]: You still have your sled?
[SPEAKER_13]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I sold that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you did a newer one anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sold it right before it stopped
snowing as much for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was probably really good timing on
your part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was good.
[SPEAKER_13]: I made money on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: On that old sled.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that sled like survived Braylorne.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love just coming over here and utterly
destroying him.
[SPEAKER_13]: Having a couple of dabs myself before I
head home.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice way to end puff Wednesday,
I'll say.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thought I was going to ride with you
all day, so it feels pretty good to at
[SPEAKER_13]: least make it over here for a session.
[SPEAKER_13]: Faded.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pow Pow.
[SPEAKER_13]: You rode a lot today though, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's like serious runs from eight o
'clock till 2.30.
[SPEAKER_13]: The snow was deep, but it was also,
you know, at times heavy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not too heavy, but just, you know,
after maybe five or six runs, I bet you
[SPEAKER_13]: were feeling it pretty good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you could feel it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You could feel it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Patty and I were feeling it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, one more dab here and then
maybe we'll let you sit B-rad might be
[SPEAKER_13]: coming by.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you're supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe he'll make it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe he won't.
[SPEAKER_13]: Either way, I'm stoked that you guys came
up to Whistler with me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Had this puff Wednesday this day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan's faded.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still going strong, but it's been a
long day.
[SPEAKER_13]: So thanks everybody for joining us and
watching puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: This one's for you.
See you next time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
