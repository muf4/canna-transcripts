[SPEAKER_03]: What if the sun's gonna be right in my
eyes?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, I should probably have my shades
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright Johnny B anytime you're ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just... I was setting my 420 on one
of them actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in case, you never know what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be a 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get it set?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no I set the 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's start it off here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B is in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bright in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the future's so bright we gotta wear
shades.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's your shades John?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in the car, that's a couple
stories away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not going downstairs,
don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well welcome to Puff Wednesday guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just myself got back from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And John, you've been hard at work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well 50 Sundays being every day this
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, every day was 50 Sundays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had a crop come down?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we had some nice resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not the LED resin, this is all the
other resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, still very nice resin I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so you know what, the best thing
about this whole line right here is this
[SPEAKER_04]: one right here my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know, I think it was about 19,
16 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least 1995, it was 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 years, you brought back a seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in November of 1995.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard they were taped somewhere too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, we did try the bun on the
vaporizer on the sub.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried that in the very beginning and
this morning I put together this nice
[SPEAKER_04]: little package.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the Full Meltz.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Jamaican Full Meltz.
[SPEAKER_03]: First bounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow, that's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you guys a little bit of an up
close and personal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while we're looking at it, of course,
as always, you'll be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice color and purity on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the best part about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get macro photos too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta get the macro photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can really see the level of purity
that we're dealing with here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not playing around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually puffed one of these on Bob
Marley's birthday while you were in
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamaica celebrating the bash there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was puffing on the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice color.
Respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course I made the dry sift and
out of respect, I haven't even tried it
[SPEAKER_04]: yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: First I brought the whole container and
that is for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well give thanks Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the nicest gift anyone could
ever... It's something that you brought
[SPEAKER_04]: back for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: For everyone who's been able to
actually... I'll let you know that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: creamy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get you trying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your first hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your first hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your first hit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I've gotta give it back to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotta give it up to Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what Johnny B has to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I forgot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: That seemed to work pretty well actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that from you sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different kind of head space on that
Jamaican, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got you boppin'.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just started hearing a little bit of
Bob.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah yes, a little bit of Bob.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I sure heard a lot of Bob in Jamaica
this year obviously being his 70th
[SPEAKER_03]: birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lime's Bread, Jamaican, 1995, Orange Hill,
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Random American who gave me the
bud as a wedding gift as I had just been
[SPEAKER_03]: married to my wife on the beach the night
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that little bit of Bob.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe it's going back to Jamaica
where it came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sure would be the dream, I'll tell ya.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a full circle like that would be
pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was talked about when you
popped that seed when you popped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there five of them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: One.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one popped.
[SPEAKER_04]: One popped.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember putting a few in the little
planter to see if they might actually
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very subtle taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sharp like these new hybrids of today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost got this light background
thing going on but as the hit dissipates
[SPEAKER_03]: you can taste it deeper and deeper in your
throat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel it in the back of my eyes and very
relaxing and just like cerebral in a
[SPEAKER_04]: sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely relief in hitting it
almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a loosening of the eardrums.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling it right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how you're saying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just behind the eyes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Superb, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, like I got some of the urn
to puff on but that I will guarantee we're
[SPEAKER_04]: getting some more probably in about three
months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now hopefully I have some in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have a few Jamaicans in there right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have enough to make some hash with,
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can finish it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just that epic first bounce that I
always talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first bounce is always very nice.
Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's leave the Congo for second last
because that is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's go with, I mean you're Mehdi
Kush that goes second last or third last
[SPEAKER_03]: after the Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that's very unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said last though, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Haley's Comet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's last for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all I got.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the anti-THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be completely straight once we hit
that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this here is the number four,
number two mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four, number two mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what about this one here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is actually the first bounce of
the Mehdi.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was just down on the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I trimmed up and I got more of the
Mehdi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what are you feeling?
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be number four, number two?
[SPEAKER_03]: Number four, number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number four, number two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Romulan OG and Larry OG?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was told it was a Larry OG crossed with
a Romulan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had said L.R.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush kind of made sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of made sense, but that's the name of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks very buttery and creamy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very tasty, but this is actually a
lot of seeds that were popped to find
[SPEAKER_04]: these axiobics of the phenols that I
liked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've numbered a few, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them didn't come back that nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them were hard, didn't grow that
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these particular ones were the tasty
ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's gone to a few people's
gardens now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoy that one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's smooth as butter, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a pretty huge sized rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: 30, 40 flush?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not sure that the flush has much
to do with the smoothness of a resin
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to the smoothness of an herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's something going on in
the cure of the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's even just maybe the luck of
the draw of the terpenes that are present
[SPEAKER_03]: and that you get a profile of terpenes
that even at a young age are appealing and
[SPEAKER_03]: smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get a variety of strains that
require more of a cure so the harsher,
[SPEAKER_03]: more volatile, sharper terpenes that hurt
the throat are able to dissipate,
[SPEAKER_03]: evaporate, whatever, and then eventually
unveil the subterpenes or sesquiterpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: or monoterpenes, the ones below that are
kind of waiting to shine, but can't until
[SPEAKER_03]: those other things have been cured out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was first the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful, beautiful resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice color on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lamb's bread hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we hit the number two,
number four.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the number four was an Old World Paki
sad strain, is what I'm told.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit with the Lario G.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are all- Paki Stanley Landry's
cross with the lemon OG?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was the Lario G or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an OG and it was- You know,
one of those strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to get so particular.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of just- Everybody always
asked and I was called number two,
[SPEAKER_04]: number four, and these were just
particular beans that- Is this the one we
[SPEAKER_04]: just hit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need to hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sat here just recently with D420K and we
slammed back 11 rips of his Full Melt Dry
[SPEAKER_03]: Sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should be able to hammer back
six of yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, that's- We might even get into
maybe some of his.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've got four of his right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we feel we want to do the 10-rip
gauntlet, we can go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: But who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got some Congo there and I've got
to say Congo is a game changer when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to gauntlets.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do the Congo roughly in
about three minutes for 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that how close we are?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, four minutes till 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys are getting ready to join
us if you haven't already.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't already, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to grab the first bounce of the
Medi.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it'll be the Congo 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might come back with a Medi again.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sun is shining.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is getting a little hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of warm, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready to get puffing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of wanted to show this cool shirt
that the cool people from Era 420 sent me
[SPEAKER_03]: in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, medicinal solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the send.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very nice flavor on the 4 and 2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that now a cross of the 4 and 2 or just
two plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: One number four, one number two,
and you mix them together?
[SPEAKER_03]: Five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five?
[SPEAKER_03]: Five plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's got a bite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to have a bite.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was...
[SPEAKER_03]: Medi first bounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medi first bounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Medi first bounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medi first bounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could rock yourself if you took a real
big fat dab of that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, I'm coughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying not to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm easing off now.
[SPEAKER_03]: My throat's getting better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I took just a medium-sized rip and
it was actually quite smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got me a little bit of a head wringer
where I'm kind of... It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Three big rips, three nice rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't go wrong with that right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll have to, of course, photograph
each one so we can get in on that macro
[SPEAKER_03]: level and see the subtle differences of
each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there are differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're getting into Congo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congo's just good for a head rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: To hit Medi Kush and then just back it up
with a Congo rip is insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nice and smooth once you warmed it
up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found that when I went to clean my
two-luffa, heated it up, and it stuck on
[SPEAKER_04]: my resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: One-minute warning for our 420 on a puff
Wednesday, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooling it down, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooling it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need no hot dabbers here.
[SPEAKER_03]: No hot dabbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need no hot dabbers in this
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: No hot dabbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool that thing down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't be putting your hot metal dabber
into your friend's perfect dry sift and
[SPEAKER_03]: just melt the whole lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 420?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we fiending out?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 420, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little bit of an off-bump.
Off-bump.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an off-bump.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was falling apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of white-guide out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Congo Bongo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in there, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: says.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Passing it over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a puff-puff pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a nice taste right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real nice taste on that Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unreal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemony with some other just different
spicy flavors in there that are hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see the terpene profile on it
so I could understand it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a strong resin, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trimming it up was so... Just reeks at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just reeked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even bumping into it in the room makes it
reek.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when it was on my deck and we would
walk by and just tap it, it was reeking.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's definitely got a very,
very, very unique smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody that smelled it in the jars,
right away they're like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the Sift, I didn't do that yet
because I just had a couple of buds,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the Sift this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sift is wicked strong, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we did just hit three other Full
Melt Rips, but that one makes me really
[SPEAKER_03]: want to relax.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just really enjoy how, how medicated I
am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I have a lot of pain or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit that I did have from
traveling the last few days, disappeared
[SPEAKER_03]: with the Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a nice profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to photograph each one and
sort of see in that close, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: version of what the resin looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got my macro lens right here, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll be, uh, we'll be going from one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: From one, one to two, one to three,
one to four, one, and finally five,
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that gets in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you really are getting close.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you're getting so close.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The phones are great with their cameras,
but they just can't quite replicate the
[SPEAKER_03]: level of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was seeing them, when he had the
shots and he actually had images of the
[SPEAKER_04]: back and stuff like that, it's quite,
quite cool that you can actually,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, that's, that's just a flame of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to describe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cushy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Supremely kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can go.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, this is like all those there,
just that the rest is definitely going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be, uh, be making medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so we better, uh, photograph this
before we rip it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's all there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the last one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was very, very minimal of the
Haley's from the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we hit that one yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, not this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I guess we better hit that one and
then we'll do this one, but I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: photograph it first because you guys want
to see this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious too, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really disappointed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only got this amount off of it,
but I really didn't want to, I just let it
[SPEAKER_04]: hit the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to agitate it or anything
because I don't want to rob anything from
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, except all the resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's not all the resin is like the Medi,
there were so much, it was so coded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when it hit the screen, it was like
poof.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really, and it's, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's marshmallow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, shall we Medi down?
[SPEAKER_04]: Medi down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_04]: You shall.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should have a rag sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kind of do this thing here where I
roll off the resin pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then put it on the, I have to say that the
new mothership is quite, quite a nice,
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a nice head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fab egg sure is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did a great job on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing that that's a production piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabbers cooled down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fingers are clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going in Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say that this was, uh,
I just, this is the one that always saves
[SPEAKER_04]: my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I like the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you had mad sessions on the Congo
yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I only did one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm telling you, look at it.
I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and really in reality, I,
I'm still like, it's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I'm sure what everyone's
waiting for is the Medi Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medi Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming soon from Berfello Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medi Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: People would love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of those two strains together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it'd be insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Female, male, male, female.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it'd be probably pretty insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of everything UKBI was pretty much the
most stoked on Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It produced, I made real nice bubble from
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice, nice tasting strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Congo is just, I don't know,
maybe because it was the forbidden for so
[SPEAKER_03]: long, but really I think there's something
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, it is an unbelievable,
unbelievably, it's one of the most,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, it's by far the most, the strongest
tasting rip that we've had today.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor on that is very, very strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharp strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting that it's over at this
end compared to the Jamaican, which was
[SPEAKER_03]: very subtle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder if that's because it was
grown here and it's used to a sun grown,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I wonder if the profile,
if we, if we're able to bring it back to
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica, if that profile will increase
through the tropical sun and give us
[SPEAKER_03]: flavors that we were missing out here,
that would be an interesting experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure has the strength.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be interesting because
that's one thing I did see actually not
[SPEAKER_04]: just thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I looked at what, what I should call
is like, there's a money zone and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: this zone, there's three different zones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the Jamaican, it produced the
resin all the way down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bud structure was very decreased when
we got down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the LEDs, it was just a bigger
bud structure at the bottom and there was
[SPEAKER_04]: compared, that was the only real
comparison.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the resin production with,
with, well, I am enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure glad I have one or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I have two LEDs right now that
I've got going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm blooming under a X2XL dominator right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got an Astro boy and oh, what are all
the strains that Tim gave me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tine, Berry, Atomical Haze maybe,
Congo, a nice Barb, Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bloomin' away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was nice, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: You only did half of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You took a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half a big one is still a pretty big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little excited in the beginning to
hit them hard, cough a little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: having to slow down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, really nice flavors, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stoked that you have such a nice stash
that you're rolling with and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: harvesting plants as always and bouncing
and making water hash too, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd actually have to get on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working on the room first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really need to get on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to basically run a 20 gallon batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing a 20 gallon batch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I'll do a 20 gallon batch
and just, you know, stop doing all these
[SPEAKER_03]: independent plants that I have all
separated and in bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm just going to like put all of
them into one 20 gallon batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do like bubble man's, you know,
lucky day profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one of my full harvests just put
into bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's called laziness catching up with
you right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get too busy and you don't have
the time to put into the water hash that
[SPEAKER_03]: you've spent all this time segregating all
your plants into different containers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have that right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ready to just like do a 20 gallon
batch though.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty good idea actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or two or three.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or two or three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what, that was one thing
about Amsterdam with the depth of hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's people were mixing a lot of
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing that was to make big
batches.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's doing a mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tastes good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look how baked we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't this great?
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's been a while just sitting
here again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I was just here a week ago
with D420K doing this very same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you were actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of relaxed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be an intro for all I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you never know with John and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: This break here could be Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we went through six different
varieties of full melt dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have D420K's dry sift and one of
mine that I cleaned here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see the difference between a
long cure and a fresher cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see the difference in the color.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has a reddish brown to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is more blonde today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely have to get a picture of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a picture of all of these subtle
differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just how you said, the three subtle
differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's probably a couple weeks old.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: The colors are just like you just said.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still pretty white though,
surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we gotta hit that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: This diesel's like really tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flavor Savior.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, New York City.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's damn fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: D420K.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: D420K.
[SPEAKER_03]: Myself always representing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have Horatio's because I have a
little of his Pineapple Express that
[SPEAKER_03]: should be here at the table as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I feel like that's pretty darn
good to have all my friends inspired into
[SPEAKER_03]: learning the trade of sift cleaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I better hit that too,
huh?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm becoming speechless because my
throat's just like, ah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm definitely, well, I could just
say, I've smoked this placebo blocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta fill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta take a photo of it first.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real test.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pouring it right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get a quick shot of it or a few quick
shots of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm really curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, this is something, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the difference?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see a difference in glass if it's
THC or CBD or, you know, if there's any
[SPEAKER_04]: difference in anything at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's how clean it is or
anything, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just get a couple of shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the theory is behind CBD blocks,
the fork effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this being high CBD and Horatio says
he just does a heavy hit of something
[SPEAKER_04]: that's high CBD could bring you down,
I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is actually just,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were noticing it with Matt's CBD
Renee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, see?
[SPEAKER_03]: Curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoked it for 10 days in Amsterdam this
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was definitely... It's still pretty
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as clean as the Congo or that
Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or any of those other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yeah, I think I only looked at
the Jamaican and the Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll make sure I go over them and get
some nice fresh pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I definitely have the ringing of the
ears and everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: The ringing of the ears.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a few shots to give you guys
an idea of what the quality is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd definitely say it's of a lower quality
compared to what else he's got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you want to start it off with a rip
there, Joni B.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little ripper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of sacrilegious after hanging out
with Skunkman Sam and Rob Clark in
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam this past year at the Cannabis
Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just definitely not down with
puffing on CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, all for science, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the sharp, sharp feeling in the
throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably because of the little bit of
plant matter in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other ones, it's amazing how as you
clean it, how creamy and smooth it gets.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% see the difference in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to, but there's very, very little.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a fruity taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find Cametonic has a fruity taste as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven rips, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should probably try D's OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go right to the bud, bud batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bud batch.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always the nice batch.
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd you feel on that stuff there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it took away my eye too
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it took away my eye too
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of went like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel pretty, I felt like I was surprised
by the flavor of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: After I blew out the sharpness,
I felt like it was very, very flavorful on
[SPEAKER_03]: my lips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much like CBD Renée.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, you know, I don't like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind it, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I just feel like I'm still
baked on all these other rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel slightly baked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel slightly that we've tried.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just a test.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do we got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got, this is D's OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we have a warning on testing
videos?
[SPEAKER_04]: A warning?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not try this at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you have a license, in which case,
puff away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, make some dry sift, grow some herb,
make some dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did this one at 55% humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 55 degrees, actually, 58, 61.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always fluctuate with it in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kept my temperature down very low for a
couple of weeks on dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did very, very well with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's all beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really quite enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're OG strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strong OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be a nice clean rip of that,
shall we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, small one.
[SPEAKER_03]: A huge one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny wants a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't even touch that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give you a baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people don't think that that's big at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see guys, they like harshly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't see them puffing on full melt
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 rips at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: She eats the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beauty of cannabis has such a wide
variety of choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2015 will be a big year, so I hope you
guys puffed a bowl with us each time that
[SPEAKER_03]: we puffed a bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure if at the end of me and
John talking and signing out, if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to hear the Bubble Man music and
then it's going to say thanks for
[SPEAKER_03]: watching, or if suddenly we'll just be in
some other random place doing what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you when we see you,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess welcome back to Puff
Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like Horatio.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: In the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B's out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Horatio's in just like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B and I, he had some incredible
sifts that we went through, I think about
[SPEAKER_03]: six or seven different rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you guys got to that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a good amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I thought it was the end of Puff
Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up hearing from Horatio that he
was on his way into the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for him, what, an hour and a half to
get to the city?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's pretty much, if I don't come
now, I've got a pack up in Portage to come
[SPEAKER_01]: again tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, get it done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not that late right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to tune in what we're doing
here with Horatio, which we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: end up tasting some of his dry sift and
your, I guess, your turp mouth in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm looking at it from,
it could, we're looking at whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the new seven star.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven star can't be, six star is the bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the deal's ultimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it melts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is a seven star the reintroduction of
the lost terpenes in the drying process
[SPEAKER_01]: added back to the dry sift?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically the impossible.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creating a new product because it's no
longer dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like turp melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Tony was calling it in
Amsterdam when he, mostly he was doing it
[SPEAKER_03]: with water hash, adding the terpenes to
the hash and doing the iron trick and
[SPEAKER_03]: getting it into this opaque shatter like
substance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we did do it a few times with the
sweet skunk dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a whole, we were calling it
turp sift, turp sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's, I've super sift,
Shiva, serums, she, there's some nectar,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think I do like seven star.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven star is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's pretty much a
denotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like live resin or anything else,
but this in the case of dry sift,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very specific because you can get six
star melt in bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any day of the week, but dry sift,
you better have your own turps and they
[SPEAKER_01]: better come from the bud you derived for.
[SPEAKER_03]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially we're not down with that clear
where you're taking terpenes out of other
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe one day they'll find out
it's cool, but to me, it sets my spider
[SPEAKER_03]: sense off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to use just the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the fact, oh, you think you're
playing God now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you understand?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a strain from concoction blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even, we'll get to the science of
it maybe in 50 years and then there'll
[SPEAKER_01]: just be another machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we go again.
[SPEAKER_03]: The profile change from just us adding a
small amount of turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much it's like, it's going to
always be the Kool-Aid of strains and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: always, and unfortunately we don't know
what the effects of Kool-Aid are when we
[SPEAKER_01]: came for medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that mix up is, it's a different type
of science.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really science at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should also add that you probably
noticed that Horatio and I both have a
[SPEAKER_03]: unit in front of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got the D-Nail 2.0 with the
mothership Faberge egg and the Peking bee.
[SPEAKER_03]: A 20 millimeter quartz bowl and whip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I over here have the straight Fab with a
14 to 14 male adapter that goes into a
[SPEAKER_03]: female quartz bowl from Germany with a 16
millimeter whip that goes down into a
[SPEAKER_03]: brand new unit I just got today from
Germany called the Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dabinator was kind enough to send this
custom box.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got my logo burnt into the top of it
and on the side it says Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if you guys can read that but
I can show that in a picture later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice looking unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right away both Horatio and I were pretty
much assuming that it would be a pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: efficient unit being from Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: The components wouldn't be Chinese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came out at 710 right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got one more degree to go but that's
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty nice little unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got the D-Nail 2.0, my standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously I love my D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've got the Dabinator out as well so
we're going to both interchange and do a
[SPEAKER_03]: few rips of Horatio's Turpmelt and then I
have a variety of sifts here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I want to give Horatio a rip of
Johnny B's first bounce of my 20 year old
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaican lamb spread hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Creamy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like one thing guaranteed when you hit it
you'll just be like that's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not sharp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if the terpenes that I
remember are lost from the tropical sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That production factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can almost smell certain things and
know there's a note that wasn't played.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet when you hit it it's really strong
and different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I got to try the Bud on a Herb Hit
and it was definitely like what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: high is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like not couch locked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not pumped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like kind of mellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like how can mellow be strong?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like oh I'm being like mellowed man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I notice you have your carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about the titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: No it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're nervous about it we've got the
ceramic one right there that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: welcome to use as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to use my titanium one on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty gentle giant hopefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I also should add that Dabinator sent
me a quartz banger as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice twist on the neck there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really just once again you can just tell
it's got that German perfection to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll look forward to hitting that in
both the straight fab and the Faberge egg
[SPEAKER_03]: in the near future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if you want to start with the
Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah because I did bring some what's it
called?
[SPEAKER_01]: God's green crack as long as the Death
Bubba but just because there's only one
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all had a green crack in our life
one time or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 years old actually this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah let's get you a rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take this one if you like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say this one's kind of the better of
the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice and clean for Horatio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a little water while we're waiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Want some water Horatio?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no water in the pipe?
[SPEAKER_03]: No water in your just in your mouth like
you can have this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't been.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure I was more worried about the dry rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no that's taken care of.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will have water in the pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I'm kind of looking forward to
hitting this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure hits different than the Fab egg I'll
tell you that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The straight fab and the fab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'll go for a little Jamaican too.
[SPEAKER_03]: First rip out of the Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's soft but it's kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't call it creamy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's a because when I tried it on the
Herbal Hit I was like wow that is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: creamy.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this I'm like whoa that's smooth but
I know my chest is full.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how I feel the effects in my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fairly strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling it it's it's a different type
of that's what I meant by what a strong
[SPEAKER_01]: low mellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not getting beat up up top but I'm
feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: John mentioned it before too behind the
eyes and I have to admit when I think
[SPEAKER_03]: about him saying that right away I feel it
as well like it's I would put money on
[SPEAKER_03]: this strain being effective in glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the way it seems to relieve tension
in the forehead and the eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I had a lot of tension going into
this head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling for it now because it was here
and heading outwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here and it's definite it's here so
it's definitely it came from my head slow
[SPEAKER_01]: and after because I was feeling in my
chest but now I see what you're saying
[SPEAKER_01]: about the eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty interesting little thing
like I said it's by far not the strongest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean John had the Congolese here earlier
which is just I mean that strain is a
[SPEAKER_03]: special strain for taste and potency as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even this New York City Diesel is probably
at the table right now one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: strongest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah no I mean that's I think that's the
strongest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a rank for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Darren showed up I was like okay that
even for the citrus because I'm not a big
[SPEAKER_01]: fan of citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like okay that I see why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see why you breed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see why you grow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a peek.
[SPEAKER_01]: I closed them up and I never know how they
transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the God's Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: God's Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that smell like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't ever smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At my home it's a crowded turpey disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to tell.
Cushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wondered about that and then that's the
Death Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Death Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened here?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what seven star looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the seven star?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's what I'm about to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did it turn into over time?
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of looks like a buttery kind of
creamery.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh it's turped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's mad turpey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright so we got some God's Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it froze it and I never
opened it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I've got the macro lens out too so
we'll be able to shoot both your powder
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble and your turpsift.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is you might mistake it for some
of that live resin if you didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the contaminant that tells you
it's not BHL.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think that we should be careful of
is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see how it's here all buttery?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't dig in all right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you a secret about this island.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the only thing that was left that
was untouched keef when I closed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to do a half and half.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I could do a half and then it
just traveled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to get a photograph of some of
this and I'd also like to get a photograph
[SPEAKER_03]: of some of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe come in from the back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah just the portion that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: The top middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah because when I added it there was
this section and I'm like oh I didn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: the halfway mark it's growing it's
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right oh I'm gonna use this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've also got that ability if you want
if you want to go like with as much
[SPEAKER_03]: thinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well this seems to be the kind this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is more dabber friendly than the than
the scoops.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right I'll hold it you pull yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right I'm gonna go in from the back
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just snot hey.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did the same thing I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: You took that first part and was like oh
that's too small I'll just double up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect these are gonna be huge fucking
rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some wet fucking sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this is this is turpsift right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven star turpsift.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep smelling it before I go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh it reeks on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bon Appetit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right off the bat.
That's changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like oh it's changing big time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone into the back of my throat and
it's twisted into the full flavor of the
[SPEAKER_03]: herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even when it went in it was like hash
but with these hints of of cannabis vapor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which now has completely satiated my
throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could taste it on my lips
stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrong kind of bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Changed my eye completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean that's the thing I wondered
about the full terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like okay now this is supposed to be a
downer high.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is death bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't find a downer at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't a downer bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more zingery and zesty like turp turp
rips that I've had in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that was because that was my first
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like I don't know what the the effect
is like because the strains didn't match.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always it was always a cocktail
blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like yeah but you're putting those
turps on this high.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I just stuck to the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind most of the turps are
available in most of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just different ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's that's all these strains are
in a ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And clearly ratios are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I suspect if we got in that HNMR
the actual you know the testing that's
[SPEAKER_03]: super accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would get us into a point where we
realize that the ones that seem like
[SPEAKER_03]: there's none of this particular terpene
it's just a fright.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the smallest most infinitesimal
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't it's a deep it's a code.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just knowing that THCV takes so little
to do so much you know every other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I'm still getting I'm still getting
a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude I'm trying to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get modulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really liked the initial exhale of it
like it was just.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really it's I don't know is seven
star cup only is it only only is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is live resin sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is live resin sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Major taste in there like vegetables
roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm it's I'm re enamored with
each strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm like OK is this your complete
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I supposed to take this message in the
morning and your dry message at night is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grabbing me that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We both have a little cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's starting to spread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you find that that was a real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still almost about to cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your water's right there sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a great puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty stoked on the heat and the whip of
the Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a huge fan of the 16 mil bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that he said he was going to try
and get me a 20 mil bowl which and a whip
[SPEAKER_03]: which will be much better for me and then
I'll also get a drop down for this so that
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that it can be down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a little bit too high for
me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get a drop down for this as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though this quartz doesn't get warm
it doesn't warm the joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found since I switched the drop down
it's just being here versus playing this
[SPEAKER_01]: game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a form of elegance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I can't see so it's a very small
surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I started with adapters to
get dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice whip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the lack of the curl in the whip.
[SPEAKER_03]: The box is really beautiful and stoked on
the quartz banger so I much appreciate Max
[SPEAKER_03]: for sending that out and you guys can
check out Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Google Dabinator because I'm not even sure
if it's dabinator.nl or .de or .com or
[SPEAKER_03]: .org but it's Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the electric nail and well that was
just real pleasant right there dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to get a couple of photos of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to start enrolling it into my
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to playing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even the playing around it's like
okay is that your strain John?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that your medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that your Medi Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well what about your Medi Kush now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it still your strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it take you further?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mainly just trying to discover was the
message deeper than I first interpreted
[SPEAKER_01]: because of my limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as I kind of got a sense of how
much turps are lost because that means the
[SPEAKER_01]: loud pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: How loud is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well those are sesquiterpinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the super super volatiles and what
Indra John Davis called them years ago to
[SPEAKER_03]: me he called them super terpinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he was one of the only people in
the world capturing them through his
[SPEAKER_03]: cryogenic process and so I have no real
way of understanding that without building
[SPEAKER_03]: a lab and getting into this game but it
seems as though in the near future Jamaica
[SPEAKER_03]: will happen and potentially I'll be able
to go there and build myself a really
[SPEAKER_03]: state of the art hash lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have people like Horatio come and join us
and help out with the science and the
[SPEAKER_03]: future of the project doing all these I
guess really just standardizing the
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it means somehow even I managed to
become involved where I'm like how is it
[SPEAKER_01]: those of us who are interested in
standardizing the medicine somehow find
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves by their own interest becoming
those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like how did I get to be considered
for Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like well I just push and I'm just
pushing just when you why do growers grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: What gets them in that room every day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well they're the only people that can
experience these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're living them because they're so
volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're essentially taking huffing dabs in
that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be something very very at the core
of our human nature why we're attracted to
[SPEAKER_01]: it and why it sticks in our brain so
that's where I want to focus my research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I am now.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is normally where you see it on
YouTube and then one day the seven star
[SPEAKER_01]: concept is something I'm participating in
so worlds change perspectives change.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel real lucky in all of this in the
sense that I mean I still have ideas and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot and I still want to try and
pioneer and help and inspire but I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: really stoked on the inspiration point
right now where it's like I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: showing these techniques in regards to
water hash and dry sifting and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to get to the point where so many
people are picking it up and it's growing
[SPEAKER_03]: exponentially that it's really I was
talking about it earlier how I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really feel the need to go and like enter
contests and try and it's a different
[SPEAKER_01]: statement position in life because I
looked at it I'm like well when I picked
[SPEAKER_01]: up sip it's because I wanted control of
data more than anything I'm like I need
[SPEAKER_01]: control because if I have a theory that
there's an actual isolated split between
[SPEAKER_01]: the dry berry theory the right very three
in the rotten berry theory sure the over
[SPEAKER_01]: ripe heads yeah the only way to prove that
I isolated I photograph it I'm like there
[SPEAKER_01]: it is there's the nice ball there's the
undeveloped there's the overdeveloped it's
[SPEAKER_03]: no longer a theory it's real yeah exactly
and that's how I learned everything with
[SPEAKER_03]: my macro photography really it was an
incredible increase in my education not
[SPEAKER_03]: from reading any books or googling
anything or reading scientific papers it
[SPEAKER_03]: was literally like I'd photograph
something and then be like oh that's
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting like what I wonder what that
is and then it starts you know well I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: big on having multi-tangential knowledge
so I can't you can't just sit and oh I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent artist I know what I know and
because at a certain point someone who
[SPEAKER_01]: knows both looks at your whole 20-minute
argument and goes no clue dry sift can
[SPEAKER_01]: auto butter the same way it's terpenes it
has nothing to do with this they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if they don't do it I guess right
that's kind of why the first time you had
[SPEAKER_01]: described I the minute you said we put the
barb in the freezer before the competition
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like why I thought it was dry the only
reason I could think of is those terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: are eating their way out that's the only
reason those guys were put in the freezer
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it turned out to be so over
timely okay the barb is unique it's out
[SPEAKER_03]: but we don't know if it's those terpenes
like for me it's the weirdest resin I've
[SPEAKER_03]: ever worked with John had some resin today
that was a little bit similar I was gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: say this the reason is if anything we say
terpenes we think oils but that's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: case right and alcohol is polar where
limiting is non-polar those are completely
[SPEAKER_01]: two different extractions and ability to
extract and I found that so when I hear
[SPEAKER_01]: anytime you guys describe these are like
strains I Google them and I start looking
[SPEAKER_01]: up analytical results and I look for the
whole soluble therapy I look for the I go
[SPEAKER_01]: all right let's I literally when you said
that I Google test of the schisca berry
[SPEAKER_01]: and I went down I'm like okay out of these
seven tests from all these random labs
[SPEAKER_01]: little little little little all right now
let's take that back information back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the bar now let's head out to its other
parent and look up that okay okay this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is practically all alcohol there's
no non-polars and that's why it'll behave
[SPEAKER_01]: differently in water compared to the ones
that actually can reject water still makes
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice water hash well no that's the
thing about it is it's Renee's stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the question no I asked you this
question what's its storage life versus
[SPEAKER_01]: its I look at that I'm like that's the
ripest juiciest berry if I leave it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: counter it's gonna go bad by tomorrow
because it's so volatile yeah I mean it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't go bad by tomorrow and even when I
say it doesn't go bad it just changes its
[SPEAKER_03]: shape I've never seen it funk out and like
grow mold no no that's not kind of what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm asking how many times can the terpene
profile change that kind of speaks to how
[SPEAKER_01]: volatile hum if can compared to well that
smells like two weeks ago when I smelted
[SPEAKER_03]: off default 20 came with a little bit of I
guess when it's fresh it's so loud when
[SPEAKER_03]: it's fresh that it can definitely change
to a degree over the course of the first
[SPEAKER_03]: month to two months Matt would be a better
person to ask because he's had it in his
[SPEAKER_03]: life for like a decade plus yeah always
the bud the hash it's always because I
[SPEAKER_01]: only experience it fresh I'm always like
what this is this is insane but I've never
[SPEAKER_01]: basically it's never kept long enough that
I'm like oh I see it's not like when I
[SPEAKER_01]: first met it which um terpene on buttery
things typically they give up and they
[SPEAKER_01]: lose some they give off so much that they
change so that's kind of why I had so many
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about the bar that yeah you're
right only Matt would know what six month
[SPEAKER_01]: old Barb is like what frozen six month old
Barb is like but it's definitely alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: based in my opinion and in look up little
look up the other turps you'll find in its
[SPEAKER_01]: parents and yeah I totally see why I'm
more of a six star is pretty much a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenon of alcohol turpene in my
opinion yeah oh yes so I think like if I
[SPEAKER_01]: anything if I wanted to figure out full
milk genetics I might if there was only an
[SPEAKER_01]: app that we could search for testing
absurd show me something show me all the
[SPEAKER_01]: strains high and little low in lemony show
me all the strains high and mercy and then
[SPEAKER_01]: we get all these tests man it's gonna be
so well that's that's different feel free
[SPEAKER_03]: to hit anything I have here there's the
diesel there's the 420 K's og there's some
[SPEAKER_03]: dry sift that I clean there's John's
Jamaican that's which dry sift that you
[SPEAKER_03]: clean that's not a strain this is right
here it was some sit it was like a hash
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that a friend from these Vancouver
Island brought you can see that you see
[SPEAKER_03]: the color difference hold it next to any
of these what is you and this must be the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash mix
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my god you switched me out now I've got
the tiny ports couldn't fit it missed it
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz I couldn't fit it I see me to hit for
you it's not that I got this is when you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to help Jesus Christ this is tough
can you get it in there you want me to put
[SPEAKER_01]: a little more in there it's in here we're
here I think I should be all right I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want to use the words are tight V
but this is a tight V if I ever tried to
[SPEAKER_03]: put a dab or anything do you know had sent
me when I literally just broke my D now
[SPEAKER_01]: then 16 mil I was bummed to pooping be
yeah this is out of my shaky range but
[SPEAKER_03]: this stuff presses up real nice oh I
didn't see that come to a thick thick like
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not giving you this big of a I was
like you get putting us on doughnuts no no
[SPEAKER_03]: no we'll just give you a little job and
take as much or as little as you like hmm
[SPEAKER_03]: somehow got my dabber like wet at the end
so the house was just like no no that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do the wrap and the hook
[SPEAKER_03]: of course you do nice to have a multitude
of nails I like the blue light along with
[SPEAKER_03]: the greenish yellow light over there might
be a thing you might see me rocking two
[SPEAKER_03]: nails from now on I want to thank
Dabinator for the kind gifts the t-shirts
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll wear them in good health the stickers
the containers the electric nail the
[SPEAKER_03]: quartz banger and of course thank D now as
always for the 2.0 custom bubble man logo
[SPEAKER_03]: on that one as well shout out to DNA army
big shout out to the DNA army I just did a
[SPEAKER_03]: video before this video thanking those
guys for some awesome t-shirts and work
[SPEAKER_03]: shirt that they sent me as well as this
hat grow your own and fucking huge shout
[SPEAKER_03]: out to Horatio for popping up and talking
about the seven-star this is just the
[SPEAKER_03]: first time you heard about the seven-star
you can start talking about it on social
[SPEAKER_03]: media now this is some Terp sift this is
some seven-star it was very interesting it
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like a live resin sitting on the
table right now zero PPM for sure zero
[SPEAKER_03]: PPMs you could get into some good
arguments with that stuff and I bet you
[SPEAKER_03]: could get into some cognitively dissonant
people who would claim they could a smell
[SPEAKER_03]: the butane yeah me out of it absolutely
I'm pretty sure I smelled the butane in
[SPEAKER_03]: there total tain run dude I don't I don't
actually sit well maybe we should finish
[SPEAKER_03]: it off with one more hit of that live
resin yeah because you haven't tried in
[SPEAKER_01]: that way I this does hit differently and
it is a different resistor with your with
[SPEAKER_03]: your your dabber you'll be able to fit it
in much absolutely this is the well this
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't gonna have a problem melting
[SPEAKER_02]: off very good look at that eh let's work
this thing asleep all right let me grab a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit a little bit I mean tons let me
just grab like a double great I almost
[SPEAKER_01]: grabbed the double and then my hand was
like no you don't you ain't going for no
[SPEAKER_01]: nice to go back between the egg and the
fab this is where we really find out what
[SPEAKER_01]: were you dabbing on and what was I dabbing
on true all right let's do this off
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday oh
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that's different on this right I can
feel it over here now bubbling in my four
[SPEAKER_01]: in my gums and I'm not a fan of bubba but
this death because they were like it's
[SPEAKER_03]: different trust us it is each time I hit
it it reminds me of something this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: bee teeth it's almost like what the hell
is that it makes you chase so many
[SPEAKER_01]: memories is it a vegetable I gave my word
it's carrot it's carrot carotene holy shit
[SPEAKER_03]: cariophylline carotene I don't know it's
it's carrot it's like really like fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome carrot like you just had carrot
juice from bubba death Wow you go on leafy
[SPEAKER_01]: and it says pine so what's the terpene
modulation of carrot because we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: a carrot strain and we find out it came
from bubba so it's like a carrot every
[SPEAKER_01]: earthy every strain again in a whole
basically it's like two sides of a coin
[SPEAKER_01]: the dry and the wet two different
medicinal efficacies from the same plant
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm sure interested in I'm loving the
way things are moving forward at an
[SPEAKER_03]: accelerated rate we don't even know what
we're doing we get together we sit we talk
[SPEAKER_03]: we get inspired someone says something in
hash church we go away we do new things we
[SPEAKER_03]: come up with new things we get back
together this is exciting man it's great
[SPEAKER_03]: to see another new product hit the it just
seems like it's a pathway that's well it's
[SPEAKER_01]: nice to see a true product because like
we've seen there are many weird things
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in vape pens basically in the
world of inhalation there's just as many
[SPEAKER_01]: new products that are negative as there
are new products that are positive so I
[SPEAKER_03]: sure love the electric nails and the
quartz I really love the quartz although
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe the next session we do we'll go back
to hitting the sick which is the silicon
[SPEAKER_03]: carbide yeah they've got me one on order
right now that they told me about that has
[SPEAKER_03]: a ledge yeah that a sapphire dish sits in
double up for melt shots yeah a sapphire
[SPEAKER_03]: ledge hitting it off the SIC so who's to
know when it'll ever end I love the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're not only trying to produce a
you know what we call what I call the holy
[SPEAKER_03]: grail which is the ultimate foundation as
anyone in the extraction game or the resin
[SPEAKER_03]: isolation or decontamination or if you're
trying to create new products like turp
[SPEAKER_03]: melt or turpsift seven star you're gonna
want to have a foundation of knowing a
[SPEAKER_03]: what the resin is when it's been cleaned
in 99% and from there you can go and only
[SPEAKER_01]: then we even know this wasn't the melts
right off the bat there would everything
[SPEAKER_01]: would be confusing there would be I don't
even it's all I can say is I'm thankful I
[SPEAKER_01]: started and I got out the gate well so
that I didn't really go through the rough
[SPEAKER_01]: stages because I'm having the opportunity
to produce high quality sift and then have
[SPEAKER_01]: that as a foundation turn and go could
there be more versus chasing the main goal
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like could there be more could I'm
smelling this I smelled I have the wet but
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smelling the dry sip I'm smelling my
LHO I'm smelling I'm smelling the raw
[SPEAKER_01]: turps do you want to sniff the raw turps
in fact you gave me turps before I left
[SPEAKER_01]: and I haven't even opened those oh those
were pecs because yeah I've got some MK
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultra my wife swears smells like thiamine
meat nice interesting maybe another
[SPEAKER_02]: episode totally up to you my friend I'm
I'm here with you now if you want or we
[SPEAKER_02]: can we could take a pause for the cops so
all right back with the turps back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: turps all right so unfortunately because I
had things to do today and I came here I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't sifted the MK Ultra is the water
yeah okay and this is the turps yeah so I
[SPEAKER_01]: brought over a fraction of that so um this
belongs to the LHO this belongs to the
[SPEAKER_01]: sift what's that a memory of
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I can definitely taste the the kush
of the MK Ultra in there yeah without a
[SPEAKER_03]: shadow of a doubt but then there's this
other thing above it it's before you get
[SPEAKER_03]: to it it's just right at the start and
then it disappears and you're deep into
[SPEAKER_01]: the kush mm-hmm that I can't call that
that that's the flash that's the most it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like 3% you get one experience it and then
you know the alcohol portion I don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know what to call that it's it's so wild
the way it turns into kush because she was
[SPEAKER_01]: like meaty salty and then she backed up
and she's like sweet because now check out
[SPEAKER_00]: the alcohol side
[SPEAKER_03]: is that citrusy taste citrusy it's still
cushy underlining but almost like like a
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolate orange or
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes are so subtle it's an incredible
game of smelling them because that's why
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited I think it's
counterintuitive too I think the way I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: taking deep smells I'm need to take these
really light it changes if we put these
[SPEAKER_01]: all in the freezer and then do an initial
because it bursts the temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature differential burst this
reminds me of one of those Christmas
[SPEAKER_03]: oranges your whack open up and it's like
an orange chocolate yeah do you smell a
[SPEAKER_03]: citrus in that check out the water
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah you you almost see brown orange
that's what I'm saying because it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh it's not but you know it's that's
that damn it's that damn the reason I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it's yeah it's like a flavoring of
orange it's not a true orange exactly the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between delimiting and orange
oil it's another one of those you clearly
[SPEAKER_01]: got some cheap orange terpenes and put
them in this I'm like this is I actually
[SPEAKER_03]: like the smell of it I don't think it
smells cheap no it's just clearly not
[SPEAKER_03]: whole yeah like orange yeah it's like
partially something from one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: components that makes an orange but taken
aside and it turns this is interesting now
[SPEAKER_03]: this is so much more interesting because
it doesn't have the sharp validity of the
[SPEAKER_03]: alcohol that's carrying that yes smell
into your nose this is truly water so
[SPEAKER_03]: right away if you took a deep enough smell
of it you'd smell nothing then you take a
[SPEAKER_03]: lighter smell almost touch it to your nose
and then you feel these strange sharp like
[SPEAKER_03]: portions of kush that are completely
missing the front the middle in the back
[SPEAKER_03]: end but there's like a component between
the front and the middle that's there yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: and between the middle and the end you can
see you can smell them but they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: like when you smell so if you tasted that
what do you expect to taste I think I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna get a little bit of a cushy kind of
taste but more of a I don't know why I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to say carotene because I'm not
really exactly sure
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not in that portion that it's
it's absolutely drinkable and when I
[SPEAKER_01]: actually interesting I made a terpene soda
for my friend Mike and I didn't add any
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar I just carbonated it the first time
I tried to do a full bottle and the soda
[SPEAKER_01]: stream exploded so instead I put in a
fraction of the alcohol this much to a
[SPEAKER_01]: full soda stream bottle tasted exactly it
unbelievably strong and delicious I
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have to do it again in order to
attempt it that's the same MK it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: different portion I actually brought that
by accident I just travel with the smaller
[SPEAKER_03]: one oops all the turp guys trip balls when
you play what did you do with the money
[SPEAKER_01]: the money's in the carpet and I can't
reach for it anymore is it the same as
[SPEAKER_03]: when you do the small perfume scale it's
really nice yeah similar I think the small
[SPEAKER_03]: perfume scale is a more concentrated way
of smelling it that's tip that's what I
[SPEAKER_03]: found I was like there's a reason for this
scale pure terpenes are a trick to smell
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like a when they're in that
concentrated form you really need to
[SPEAKER_03]: create a waft to catch the smell of it
because otherwise it's such a great smell
[SPEAKER_03]: it's too much for your sense it's like
yeah there's a bunch of senses shutting
[SPEAKER_03]: down yeah as you're getting the rush but
that one wasn't too much when I held it
[SPEAKER_03]: under my nose the concentrated I mean it
was the equivalent of taking a bong rip
[SPEAKER_03]: that's in a big giant neck compared to one
that's real small you know what the
[SPEAKER_03]: restriction is like it's the same with the
smelling the restriction smell yeah that's
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of that citrus yeah there's some
really citrusy stuff in there I say we
[SPEAKER_03]: take a hit in the New York City Diesel
just because this has inspired me too and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's sitting right here I'll load you up
so we can guarantee you oh I do have after
[SPEAKER_01]: the water and alcohol for the oh good
let's see all right so death but the
[SPEAKER_03]: alcohol I'm gonna go water first this time
because the alcohol was just such a great
[SPEAKER_03]: smell oh wow are you kidding me was that
like bubble gum or something bubble gum
[SPEAKER_03]: but then but then once that disappears in
the first 10 to 20 percent you're left
[SPEAKER_03]: with this crazy antiseptic smell that
smells like your grandma that's crazy what
[SPEAKER_03]: is that smell that smell the end of that
that's like a old folks home or something
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a thing that your grandma keeps in
the corner of the bathtub that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: makes the bathroom smell worse it's not
her purse but no it's it's it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: something she has under one of her soaps
and you carry it yeah it doesn't taste
[SPEAKER_01]: that strong that well the thing she's
wearing is it perfume plus her dirty
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaners cleaning soap or just now it's
pretty now this is tripping me out right
[SPEAKER_03]: now dude so what people are watching this
and laughing their heads off in our
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation right well it's well the
bubble comes listen the bubble comes there
[SPEAKER_03]: right at the start you smell it yep candy
you get that candy wrap something
[SPEAKER_03]: something there is candy and to me it just
initially was a bubble and then see I see
[SPEAKER_01]: colors typically and the colors tell me
where I am well that's greenish yellow
[SPEAKER_03]: what color is that because I don't really
see colors I'm just like I went out on a
[SPEAKER_01]: limb and thought that's kind of it's like
I tend to smell I try to smell the colors
[SPEAKER_01]: and what do I see like where will it put
me I guess I'm thinking it's it's green
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's smell in the sense that I don't
know if it's a time or if it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of herbs that are changing itself
if you get too close it starts to get more
[SPEAKER_01]: candy right and then because I was like
I'm like I try the alcohol go for it while
[SPEAKER_03]: you're continuing on with your water oh
shizer look at that one the alcohol ones
[SPEAKER_03]: are such a pleasure because obviously that
the sharpest of the bunch obviously taking
[SPEAKER_03]: a drink of alcohol compared to taking a
drink of water is really the differences
[SPEAKER_03]: between these smells it's truly alcohol
and water I like it so much because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not we just focus so much on the oil the
oil the oil that I haven't seen anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: who's fraction this off and that's the one
I'm most excited about because tincture
[SPEAKER_01]: wise that's pretty potent stuff yeah I'm
not even sure what to say about that one
[SPEAKER_03]: that one's uh that one almost made me
dizzy smelling it yeah it's strong this is
[SPEAKER_03]: modulating the high I'm just from smelling
it it is I feel like we've been huffing
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes here for the last five minutes
and I'm a bit dizzy this one's a this one
[SPEAKER_01]: is dizzying it's dizzy isn't it what's the
dizzy what's the dizzy alcohol terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've never tested before I don't
know I'll tell you one thing it cleared my
[SPEAKER_03]: sinuses I felt it move through my sinuses
so you're saying in Jamaica I'll be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to pour this in well not pour it in
five-gallon buckets fifty five-gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: buckets not even I'm not even I'm just
interested in the machine that will tell
[SPEAKER_01]: me really tell us and HMR yeah no more
buying wiggy woms than your HMR yeah cuz
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's buying standards and now we
have a new standard our numbers are
[SPEAKER_01]: jumping I'm interested in this especially
for the terpenes because the terpenes are
[SPEAKER_01]: the new numbers we want to know all about
especially how accurately well is this is
[SPEAKER_01]: death bubba nasal cream made out of this
is that what is that the message from it
[SPEAKER_01]: and separate from this which may be colic
water there is a lot of potential and just
[SPEAKER_01]: the these non phyto cannabinoid based
cannabis medicines absolutely thus they
[SPEAKER_03]: are modulators so potentially for all we
know that you could be taking one form of
[SPEAKER_03]: saturating your endocannabinoid system
with transdermals or the sublingual drops
[SPEAKER_03]: or even vaporizing or consuming edibles
and then you could use a product like this
[SPEAKER_03]: in another form of perhaps drops or
transdermal or whatever and and modulate
[SPEAKER_01]: well the thing is that's the thing is I'm
like well I can without even thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about modulating let's just never seen
this ratio of terpenes in therapeutic use
[SPEAKER_01]: either orally aromatherapeutically or and
cannabis gives us another potential we're
[SPEAKER_01]: just growing it to juice the alcohol
because the alcohol turns out to be
[SPEAKER_01]: something right that's I get excited when
you can completely step away from phyto
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and cannabis still has so
much for mankind that it just makes you go
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my god well you're a fraction man yeah
people just we've got so much going on
[SPEAKER_03]: with what if we just get this into a
machine in Jamaica that can fraction it
[SPEAKER_03]: into all of its components well that's and
then you can take each one of those and
[SPEAKER_03]: put it into the machine and potentially
fraction those down the reason only reason
[SPEAKER_01]: why I'm scared is because there is already
300 of these if I just have river rock
[SPEAKER_01]: straights that's what I'm saying so if I
just put in the machine and get a feedback
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we find a therapeutic clinical
trial use that's already our lifetime
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else will fraction it and then
put it back together I'm like keep feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: this thing frigging alcohol fractions and
water fractions and the oil fraction and
[SPEAKER_01]: did I mention the bud still smells like
the loud pack so there's fractions that we
[SPEAKER_01]: know that are already in there so you can
actually take the bud like bud and now go
[SPEAKER_01]: and extract other turkeys out of it that
have nothing to do with what I'm dealing
[SPEAKER_03]: with right now how excited are you guys
right now listening to this conversation
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty pump clicking like sweet shit are
we blocking you harshly with this pipe
[SPEAKER_03]: here no clue get that out of the way man
look you've had this whole pipe right in
[SPEAKER_03]: front of your face the entire time I'll
look back at the video go oh just wrote
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just cut it out and shift it oh where
does face go just look at me doing some
[SPEAKER_03]: maneuver and look I can do it
[SPEAKER_01]: ninja ninja I'm gonna swing this one last
time because it did make me it made me
[SPEAKER_03]: dizzy I don't know if it was the
culmination of smelling the four before it
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I'm trying to figure out if now
if it still has that I just had a hit of
[SPEAKER_03]: this New York City diesel from d4 20k and
it was delicious I also hit your I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: say this is the green crack yeah the green
crack because obviously the death bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: is the ooze so we hit that a bunch of just
try it one more time and let's wrap up
[SPEAKER_01]: does it still do it
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm feeling it in my heart
it's sharp yeah it's definitely sharp it's
[SPEAKER_03]: me absolutely 100% when I stop exhaling
that thing let's feel like it just takes
[SPEAKER_03]: hail to hit like an like an expector and
feeling in my lungs yeah my lungs my my
[SPEAKER_03]: dude it does it's got a bit of a pick me
up I want to say lemony but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: lemony it's sharper like grapefruit
grapefruit grapefruit time or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like grapefruit herb some type of that's
why my wife says season me yeah it's
[SPEAKER_01]: seasoning for sure it's seasoned she's
like this is like I'm smelling cold meat
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really nothing but seasoning and
I'm like really and I'm like there is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely fine she named that one she
started with meaty salty and then she's
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's got time because when time is
dried then it's the subtle terpene it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not the roaring oil on the fresh one yeah
so the fresh one is strong yeah it seems
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what it is the dried time well
unbelievable wicked conversation as always
[SPEAKER_03]: brother I wish we could go on forever but
well it's got to be another time we got to
[SPEAKER_03]: have another show we can't we can't do it
all in one show and give you everything at
[SPEAKER_03]: once but that was quite a bit for how late
at night is it now so you've now heard of
[SPEAKER_03]: the seven star turpsift turp melt
awesomeness alcohol-induced terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: modulation the alcohol-induced terpene
modulation where we're literally you know
[SPEAKER_03]: doing smellings during after in between
rips we checked out the dabinator it was
[SPEAKER_03]: cool we enjoyed the D nail as always the
mothership held it down with the straight
[SPEAKER_03]: fab fab egg session fuck dude as always a
super pleasure having having you come by a
[SPEAKER_06]: ratio take it easy guys shoot a kind of
real cloudy like I say
