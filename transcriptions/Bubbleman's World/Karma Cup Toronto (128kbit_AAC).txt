[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and welcome to Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at Pearson International Airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just flown in from Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my Apex pen, as you know,
I don't really fuck around when I come to
[SPEAKER_02]: Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada-wide, I was pretty good and didn't
puff on the plane, but here at the airport
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since I had a good toot,
so of course I'm going to have to have one
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm about to go outside and meet
Elliot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here for the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah's Sunday is throwing the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is today, the final day of judging and
the festivities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got Matt, the great gardener,
waiting for me at my hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's flown in on a special occasion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he had a family thing going on,
but he happens to be here for the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, pretty exciting all in all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to head on out, grab my bags,
hook up with Elliot, have a session,
[SPEAKER_02]: head down to the hotel, hook up with Matt,
have a session, and then I guess we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to hang out to head down to the
Karma Cup and check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to have you guys here with me in
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, this is just the first part
of the trip, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow we go to Jamaica for a week,
and then after that we head down to
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam for the Cannabis Cup for 10
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am picked up by my good buddy Elliot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elliot in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elliot's been a friend of mine for a good
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be going on well over 10 years
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we kind of see each other here and
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was living in LA for a while,
doing the hip-hop thing, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: ESI.
[SPEAKER_02]: ESI.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elliot's actually helping me out
enormously.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to take Bubble Man's world to
the next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know exactly what we're trying to
do with it, but Elliot works in that sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of...
Big teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Big teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elliot's working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll hear more from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see more of Elliot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll probably be at Hash Church tomorrow
morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, we're going to head down
to the hotel here, set up the D-Nail,
[SPEAKER_02]: and get sweet skunking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the ride, Elliot.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries, man.
Anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toronto bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just bumped into the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got here a little while ago with my boy
Elliot, picking me up at the airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we are at the venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Underground Cafe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just down the street here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to head on in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to check out Sarah Sunday's
Karma Cup.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Matt's got some entries in
the Karma Cup, so we might as well...
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Redbeard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might see him taking home a cup from
Redbeard.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's head in.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are here at the Underground Cafe,
chilling at the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Familiar faces over at this table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you guys, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's the Karma Cup doing so far?
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear there's like many edibles,
many sativas, indicas, solventless,
[SPEAKER_02]: solvent, the whole nine yards.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen a single entry yet,
but I'm sure I'll be puffing on some in
[SPEAKER_02]: the near future here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking A, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, one straight left for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to go do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Jason.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a few minutes for a few seconds
just to say what's going on at the Karma
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup here with Jason Wilcox.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a good time here with the coalition
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people here representing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Redman was just up on stage talking about
what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, hats off to Thaddeus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with Thaddeus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he just collecting trophies tonight
or...?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's collecting trophies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also donating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's representing the coalition.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not necessarily donating tonight,
but he has in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Thaddeus is a big supporter,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mad respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for everybody here, round of applause
when they got up there saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came down to show our support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm telling you, it is hard to judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a lot a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you judge 18 medibles in a week?
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The medibles screwed up the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can you judge that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a separate competition,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we almost did like a fourth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four weeks or four months to do something
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to light up the D-Nail
here soon and I'll call you over when I
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks for taking time out and
chatting with me, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Jason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this where all the cool guys are
hanging out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, are you collecting trophies tonight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking A's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking A's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm here with MedMan and the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's clearly some people in the house
that know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty excited to start checking it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to light up the D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll catch up with you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we want to vote to make this shit
fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone not know who this bitch is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause she's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say bitch with the highest regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: No standing ovations in this crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you a dabbing ovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting our hand in a bag and we're
picking a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Candy Press, A Marijuana New School
Indoor Cultivation by Jeff Mota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wants this book?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your energy into the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stairs going to pull you on number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not here, you don't fucking
get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero, two, nine, one, zero, four,
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it's ending in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero, four, one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ends in zero, four, one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got a book?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took the closest guy to the stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's so organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's writing down who's won things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, bubble man back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, I am no longer at the
party.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am now at my hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wow, I feel like I smoked about 800
joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I did not have one rip at the
Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was extremely smoky and both my friend
and I were, unfortunately we had to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was a little too smoky for me
on the herb side of things, but Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: stayed and Matt is going to find out,
you know, who won and won.
[SPEAKER_02]: What not for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure I'll have a footage of it,
but I'll definitely give you a little
[SPEAKER_02]: update, almost like a puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad I got to show you guys a little bit
about, a little bit about the party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry that I was kind of lame and wasn't
able to stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am traveling tomorrow to Jamaica and I
didn't want to get my throat any sort of,
[SPEAKER_02]: in any worse situation that it was now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to wrap this up here in
the hotel in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess we'll see you guys tomorrow
for Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be doing Hash Church tomorrow
out of Vapor Central on Yonge Street here
[SPEAKER_02]: in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are around, love to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on down from 11 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: till 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be at Vapor Central and I'll be doing
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be the next part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning, morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stayed the whole night.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't tell in my voice or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned it last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my little video guys that I had to
leave a little early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a bit of a lightweight for all the
cannabis smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of cannabis smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and all fantastic event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah Sunday pulled off a great show.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of familiar faces and good
folks there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful food right upon walking in the
door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was really friendly and nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wish that I could have stayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw people there that I met at The
Chance Show that I haven't seen ever
[SPEAKER_02]: before or since.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I walked in and I was like,
do I know you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I bought some screens off you
at The Chance Show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always tough when someone's like,
hey, Matt, come sit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you sort of sit down for that moment
and you're like, have we met before?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday, for whatever reason,
the three people that I recognized from
[SPEAKER_02]: Champs, I remember them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't remember their names,
but I was like, did you buy like Dry Sift
[SPEAKER_02]: screens?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yeah, yeah, I bought Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of Dry Sift,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Matt, so tell us the story behind this
second place cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this second place cup was,
we called it Barb 92 Sift only because I
[SPEAKER_03]: had run out of Barb 99 Sift because those
are all going to be in a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: contests in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Carmen Cup kind of snuck up on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It snuck up on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sort of, congrats to Red Beer for sort
of calling me out and saying, don't you
[SPEAKER_03]: wish, don't you want one of these cups?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sort of saw how awesome they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, wow, man, I kind of do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of do want one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm impressed with the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm impressed with the painting that the
girl did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a little thing on the bottom.
Really?
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a total last minute thing and we
didn't have any firsts left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were like, god damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had, you just cleaned that five
minute run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the seconds was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the D-nail there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, oh wow, let's test everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the seconds of that run was still
super melty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was still super melty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were like, well, let's go figure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's enter the seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see how the seconds of the process
does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And voila, we sort of get second place
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, second place is no slouch for the
second pass of Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was the seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And go figure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt took home a second place cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll be looking forward to hitting
that when we get back home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come by and have a session with you
out of that pipe one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a great event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I can't say enough about Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a fantastic time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to next year,
Karma Cup 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I'd come back here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: My only complaint, and this is the same
complaint that you get everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the same problem at our Legends of
Hash party every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sheer velocity and amount of smoke
that just fills the air and moves around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at Legends, it's a little
different because there's no paper,
[SPEAKER_02]: no glue, and no plant matter in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get a certain amount of smoke in
the air, you're no longer getting oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just slowly, the hardest of the hard
cores I've seen walk outside and just be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I'm just going to have a little bit
of fresh air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the same thing last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think next year at the Karma Cup,
I definitely will only say that same with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: With Legends, little ventilation fan go a
long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiny little ventilator, like a hyper fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking of how many growers were in
the room with Matt there and Thaddeus
[SPEAKER_02]: Medman and Sarah Sunday and all these
other people that I recognize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking, man, there's like 50 growers
in the room right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have any ventilation in this
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, killer event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely will come back next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Sarah Sunday collected so many
prizes to give away at that event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly believe she had almost a prize
for each person that was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Books and lights and fans and bubble nows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up putting a little package of
papers, lighters, sticker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I put a jar of the Barb 73
micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wins it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Medman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thaddeus goes up, takes it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all just like, how ironic is sort of
Medman.
[SPEAKER_03]: And wins the sample I throw in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I don't know how many people
were in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1,500.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So left over on the day today,
I'm going to try and go do a hash church
[SPEAKER_02]: over at Vapor Central.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's only for an hour,
I really want to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do fly to Jamaica today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that nervous feeling of
whenever you fly into another country,
[SPEAKER_02]: you kind of like to be organized and
prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a weird thing to go do a hash
church.
[SPEAKER_02]: For two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you just run to the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to Jamaica first.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be seeing you in Amsterdam when you
get back from Chile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go to Chile next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's off to South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm off to the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're both going to meet up in
Amsterdam for the Legends of Hash Dinner
[SPEAKER_02]: and for the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that's probably the next time
you guys will see both of us together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, congratulations again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how the first do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seconds win second.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first will win.
Stay tuned.
Yeah.
Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
