[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, people I love Yeah, yeah, John Thanks
for every day, John From who is defense
[SPEAKER_00]: when he away, yeah, John Iran will come to
feed over there, yeah, John Love will
[SPEAKER_00]: protect revenge
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the new product John, yes,
you haven't checked this out yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm absolutely You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited a dry sifter of your stature.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would expect so Yeah, of course crack it
open check it out stainless steel mesh
[SPEAKER_04]: happening in here Pretty easy Yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do something a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know all these plastic models on the
market today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Originally what I also wanted to
do was Add cold packs, but I thought you
[SPEAKER_04]: know this is metal So people could throw
this in there in the deep freezer and get
[SPEAKER_04]: it all cold before they fill it up for a
little for a little dry sifting And then
[SPEAKER_04]: of course one of the things you'll really
like about this unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking right here the screen here our
secondary screen 70 micron, which is my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did you have to make this 200 lines
per inch 70 micron and Good for cleaning
[SPEAKER_04]: up the resin that you've once already
Extracted instead of falling onto a catch
[SPEAKER_04]: tray We've got a secondary screen that
will allow us to clean out the
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminants that we depending on how
rough you've Extracted if you tumbled for
[SPEAKER_04]: a minute, you'll have a lot less cleaning
if you tumbled for 10 or 15 minutes You're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna have a lot more cleaning to do so
Yeah, we're pretty excited about this this
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger unit to I'm suspecting I'll be able
to get at least a pound and a half worth
[SPEAKER_04]: of material into this unit here as the
other unit is much smaller Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: and and I mentioned it to you and her and
Dude, I actually brought something for you
[SPEAKER_04]: to do that with all right Well,
why don't we let John go find what he
[SPEAKER_04]: found for us to do and we're gonna maybe
make some Medicine for someone today.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah So just to show you the smaller
tumble now I have over here just that a
[SPEAKER_04]: camera The original unit right here You
can see the different size difference
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a bit of a smaller can on the inside
smaller tray This one I've already used
[SPEAKER_04]: you can see that there's not much left on
top of the screen But I have quite a bit
[SPEAKER_04]: of catch what I call catch and this Is
mostly yeah, you know not to say that
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no actives that left in there But
there's definitely a lot fewer than when I
[SPEAKER_04]: began anything smaller than a 70 micron
screen will be Will be pushed through
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is some Some actives just not a
terrible amount Take this one down Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the original unit the smaller unit
more and more people than asking me for a
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So
All right,
[SPEAKER_04]: one thing I don't suggest is doing what
we're doing right now and having your unit
[SPEAKER_04]: sit in the Sun Just from having this lid
open the unit lid is extremely warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we start this mix What I'm gonna
do is just take this guy out Go pop them
[SPEAKER_04]: in the freezer for a quick minute You can
maybe tell them a little bit about that I
[SPEAKER_02]: Am to also gonna take this out of the Sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that's what we're doing this So,
uh, this looks like some really fine
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine here That's just a popcorn and
the trim that she's actually kept for
[SPEAKER_02]: herself and she's asked me to clean it for
her because with her condition she's
[SPEAKER_02]: realized that just using the triclones
work very well for her condition because
[SPEAKER_02]: she she has she has MS and Now she's able
to medicate and still be able to do her
[SPEAKER_02]: job, but she works in professional fields
So for her just taking a little bit amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of just medicine clean like what I do
myself works very well for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just just some good old We take a
better look at that you can show you that
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty good material, but it's
it's not the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right Yeah, so why don't we
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice glistening glistening.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we should fill this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna do this Yeah, we might as
well throw a secondary one in there Same
[SPEAKER_02]: same material We'll start with this Yeah,
yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll put this down This is magnetic
seals nice and tight That just dropped in
[SPEAKER_04]: there perfect one just plugged in Start
spinning a Terribly fast spin you can kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of see the resin
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep the lid closed just because I
don't that once again that Sun is really
[SPEAKER_04]: hot and I don't want the metal to heat up
in any way I would urge you to do this in
[SPEAKER_04]: a cold place if you can a walk-in freezer
a basement a wine cellar something colder
[SPEAKER_04]: than your average room in your house,
so Yeah You can Tumble for as long as you
[SPEAKER_04]: want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally really like to tumble for 15
to 30 seconds Call it a day and then see
[SPEAKER_04]: what I got and see how long it's gonna
take me to clean it with my microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Open up the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can definitely see a nice glaze of
heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, there's that's diamondy Absolutely,
we'll get some photographs with the macro
[SPEAKER_04]: camera Out of the camera and we'll be
right back John and I are gonna sit and
[SPEAKER_04]: talk for a while We'll be back in just a
little bit All right, so just doing a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more tumbling here We do a
quick check We got happening on the screen
[SPEAKER_04]: Decent little amount It was after a couple
more minutes So this particular material I
[SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't say is drenched in mature heads,
but still is Gonna make some nice medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: for someone in need One more pile to work
with So from a little bit that we got just
[SPEAKER_04]: from our 15 to 20 Second tumble that we
did I've now kind of collected it all into
[SPEAKER_04]: the middle Photographed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's It's it's your average farmers grade,
you know, probably maybe 50 to 60 percent
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminants, maybe maybe a little bit
more I've seen it as high as 90 so I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: consider that to be extremely high,
but now I just kind of gently Card it over
[SPEAKER_04]: the screen Get those contaminants pushed
through it's a nice big screen so you can
[SPEAKER_04]: work with as much of it as you want
Contaminant will go through faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see little hairs or fibers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never a bad idea to just get them out
with your hand So I'll generally just do
[SPEAKER_04]: this for a little while until I see the
the dry sift reacting the way I want it to
[SPEAKER_04]: clean together a little more and It'll
also be a little like it's what I would
[SPEAKER_04]: call fluffy right now and eventually as
you clean it it becomes You know more more
[SPEAKER_04]: lumpy So that's kind of what I'm looking
for not to say that you know smoking this
[SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't be a real nice experience,
but it's still Massive contaminants and
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole purpose of the secondary screen
is so you can clean up what you extract So
[SPEAKER_04]: we're just gonna clean a little bit of
this up get it to about 90 percent
[SPEAKER_04]: glandular heads and then John and I are
each gonna have a nice rip and then we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: do a little bit more tumbling and We'll
talk more with John about dry sifting So
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just been carding it for a little bit
here You can't really tell that much has
[SPEAKER_04]: gone through unless you open up the top
screen and then you see the black plate
[SPEAKER_04]: it's That's a fair bit of stuff that's
gone through there Very talcum powdery
[SPEAKER_04]: still gonna be some heads all the heads
that are smaller than 70 micron will end
[SPEAKER_04]: up under there Nothing above 70 micron is
going to go through this screen so we
[SPEAKER_04]: should manage to once we get the rest of
the contaminants out And I've only been
[SPEAKER_04]: doing this for maybe five minutes five
minutes I managed to push I'd say at least
[SPEAKER_04]: 25 to 30 percent of the weight right
through we were guessing it was at least
[SPEAKER_04]: 60 percent contaminants, so I've increased
it its quality just by reducing the
[SPEAKER_04]: impurities And we're just gonna keep at it
for another five or ten minutes,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll come back and have a nice monkey
bone rip with you guys You just hit all
[SPEAKER_04]: right So just gently Sort of running this
resin over the screen now by all means
[SPEAKER_04]: this is not like the only Way to to do
this and I urge you all to come up with
[SPEAKER_04]: new ways and play around and have fun But
it is one guaranteed way of getting
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself down up to 90 you know 90 upwards
of 98 99 percent pure gland heads by just
[SPEAKER_04]: Slowly reducing and removing the
impurities that are trapped in the
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction because of course everything Is
falling without with the help of gravity
[SPEAKER_04]: no no water keeping things afloat like in
bubble hash We kind of got to do this
[SPEAKER_04]: little process, but I'll tell you when you
take a hit of this Yeah, no chemicals no
[SPEAKER_04]: footprints not even lost turkeys Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone loves it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of call it the holy grail
[SPEAKER_04]: It's starting to look a lot purer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny the purer it gets the easier it
is to see And so when I really start to
[SPEAKER_04]: the naked eye it looks real clean and then
as I get it cleaner It looks dirty
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely you know for sure that no
little pinky finger just to dab out little
[SPEAKER_04]: fibers I'll take a shot with the macro
lens here soon and see See if we've
[SPEAKER_04]: cleaned up a noticeable amount of
contaminants
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke the material we just clean because
it's it's someone else's medicine But John
[SPEAKER_04]: has a really nice dry set that I've been
holding hostage in my pocket here
And I have a nice
[SPEAKER_04]: One D line, but we can make it work I Know
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Oh, there's nothing in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full melt, cleared off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was many wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll share the funnels with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll share the melt video with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll show one of the residents that we
ended up distracting from the sun.
