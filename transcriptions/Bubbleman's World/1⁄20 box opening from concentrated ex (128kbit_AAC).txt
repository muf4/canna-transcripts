[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: BC Bubbleman here on my 29th wedding
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went to go find some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lost my last jar of good dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decided, oh my God, I still have the 2023
10th anniversary special from Concentrated
[SPEAKER_00]: X.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure how many of you are aware
of Concentrated X, the hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrated Evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great Fino picker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great single source grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some years ago, a year ago now or
so, he sent me this, which as you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: is number one of 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a great relationship with him
over the years, and I like to say I helped
[SPEAKER_00]: mentor him in learning how to make hash
and selling him bags and kind of being a
[SPEAKER_00]: good buddy to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me one that's supposed to be
refrigerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me another one that I guess is
supposed to be frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can't even remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one definitely feels like it's been
the refrigerated one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one feels like it's been more just at
like refrigeration, and this one's more
[SPEAKER_00]: like frozen temperature, like freezer
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today is my 29th wedding anniversary,
thus the cut on my chin for shaving and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to look nice for my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to smoke some nice hash today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for whatever reason, I have jars,
don't get me wrong, I have jars of hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's nothing spectacular really,
you know, that's like the highest level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought on my anniversary,
I should be smoking something high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, I'm planning on
opening these for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what is in these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me the two boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are marked one of 20, both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says extract pack box one of two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says flower and berries box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's open up the flowers and the
berries first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the custom packaging from
Concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to ruin the tape too much and see
if we can't just slide this box out of
[SPEAKER_00]: here nicely without destroying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to have to do a little
bit of destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to throw that off to the
side and we're going to check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this Concentrated Evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his little sticker there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got flower and berries pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check that out,
that looks pretty, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's showing the reflection of everything
off of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to go back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still see the phone reflecting in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a little cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the scene here, a little tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of clean the resin off of it
first, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that sticky fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flowers and berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the beautiful Concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how nice that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be the first flower that I've
smoked in a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a really nice flavor profile on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if you guys can see that nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a nice seal on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he gave me some berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if these are... Oh,
well, let's read what he says here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you get when two longtime legacy
producers get together and throw down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's Concentrated Evolution and
Snakeson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't nothing short of epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Strawberry Banana Ultra Premium
Collection would not exist had it not been
[SPEAKER_00]: for the inspiration and contribution of my
good friend Snakeson made to the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snakeson is a true legend for the
uninitiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a true legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pioneer in the solventless scene who
under the West Coast collective and melts
[SPEAKER_00]: and banners brought some incredible whole
plant fresh frozen and raws into the
[SPEAKER_00]: community over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the Snakeson banner, he continues
his legacy track record.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have personally experienced by the
best edibles in the nation and I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: will agree once you get to try the
incredible member berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the member berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from, I'm guessing from Adam,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: melts and now Snakeson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely handcrafted using our Strawberry
Banana Full Spectrum 25U to 160U Live
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: These member berries perfectly complement
our Strawberry Banana flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please consume and dose responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time they're small but mighty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really liking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving that gift from both of these
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much Concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is absolutely beautiful and wonderful
and I'm gonna start eating those member
[SPEAKER_00]: berries today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might even be some of the first flower
that I roll up and actually smoke in a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint in over 24 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine paying homage any other
way to you for this really quite
[SPEAKER_00]: spectacular gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just gonna get the sticker back in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now let's check out my favorite one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Concentrated Pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this one is gonna slide
out for me like the last one didn't but I
[SPEAKER_00]: can always give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to get that one perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfectly and that way we can keep all of
this exactly the way it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still looks like the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep refrigerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I did homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept this frozen the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just refrigerated but actually frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super stoked dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't had some Concentrated X in a while
and this is what we got inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Box number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says 10th anniversary special
Concentrated Evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Concentrated X has concentrated the
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course he's well known for the DNA
genetic strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even notice that he put this
beautiful coin in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10th anniversary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a little coin made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh as well as some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what that says.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013 to 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the little Tegrity Farms guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a nice little explanation of the
cultivars right here that are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the glossy finish on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see whenever I hold it up it
actually shows me reflecting inside from
[SPEAKER_00]: my phone that's filming me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a couple of jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got one gram each.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got one gram of the 120U full melt jar
strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got a one gram U of the 120
micron live hash rosin strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got two of these here.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn I guess I better turn on the
D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be weird to do this video and not
have a little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the dunk tank and the marbles out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the turp slurper into the pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom boom boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a little turp slurping action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're gonna drop that right into
the universal heater which is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give that a few seconds to heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes usually no more than a couple
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn on the temp tech and just want
to shout out Concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really nice gift dude and I
apologize for holding onto it for a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: year before I actually opened it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been nothing but a gentleman and a
scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been an absolute bubble ambassador
of the highest level for a very very long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say that I personally very
much appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the packaging with the Tegrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the old Tegrity Farms there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Tauley on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is such slick nice looking packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish I could do it in the legal world but
I'm guessing South Park would probably sue
[SPEAKER_00]: me if I put things like this on my
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just gonna give it the old thumbnail
twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh my goodness it's deep in there but
you can see a gram of just spectacular
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry banana live hash rosin for the
win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be very very well enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna open up the bubble now as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love getting Concentrated X bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's never been warmed up it's usually
just in perfect trichome isolation
[SPEAKER_00]: separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pure heads sitting on top of one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this you know globbed into one
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually happens within five minutes of
leaving it at room temperature which
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully this wasn't enough time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure heads looking absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I say to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for thinking of me bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have been happy with number 19 out
of 20 or number 20 out of 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that you sent me one out of 20
was special and I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna hold on to this packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna eat the member berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna smoke the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna smoke the bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely going to be enjoying the
flower as well which is not something
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll hear me say very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the little coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just been super stoked to be a
part of your journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: A part of your journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know where to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll probably start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you not start with a full melt
bubble?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you not start with the full melt
bubble?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just let's see if I can get a little
bit out without.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah this is, this is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna chisel some off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna drop it into my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're gonna make this just with
the warmth of our hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take that little bit and I'm
gonna put my thumb on that and give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just disappeared basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get that onto the end of the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a huge dab but it definitely
shows that there is a quality there that
[SPEAKER_00]: is really second to none.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna end up smoking this whole
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little party to go to tonight but
for now we'll start with a little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll dip that in there and get a
little bit more of the fresh headies on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a plant, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made it a little bit, little bit
nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just coated it in more pure heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: More pure heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, I'm gonna get this
sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little freezer sitting on the
side of my, oh that's not the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you know how sometimes you go to put
a USB in and it's like, no it doesn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh this USB has been crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably why that is not opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just put those in there for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you preserve incredible quality
hash as you receive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, dude, second to none,
I've never been given a nicer packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boxes, the jars, the coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let me just make sure we got
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my coin right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which looks like it's sealed in this piece
of plastic and you can't even open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, you can open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that is seriously pimp, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a page out of this book and
I'm gonna create some of these super cool
[SPEAKER_00]: coins for the Bubble Man brand down in
America and we'll make it a special thing
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can, you know, acquire one
through, I don't know if it'll be a type
[SPEAKER_00]: of contest or what it'll be, but I really
gotta say that that is a level of class I
[SPEAKER_00]: have not yet seen in the hash world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, shout out to ConcentratedX.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Meltson for putting together
the member berries and shout out to D&L
[SPEAKER_00]: for producing such a lovely little unit
that I'm guessing I'm probably in line for
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice little dab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dab is gonna absolutely crush me,
which I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very happy about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned off the, the alarm on my dab
right, so you won't hear it go off,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is at 550 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bubble hash, I'll always hit a little
bit warmer than rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bon Appetit if you're joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let me tell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That right there is what it was always
about for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That almost, where it wants to close up
your throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to make you close your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants you to go in in a very,
very, very deep way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dunk tanking my banger here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in, I've fallen in love with
Full Melt Bubble from the day I first
[SPEAKER_00]: tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not to say that I don't
absolutely love and appreciate the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think rosin is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way for us to take our bubble
that is subpar non-Full Melt Bubble and
[SPEAKER_00]: get it into a product that makes it an
amazing product that elevates it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: point where it's still very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've said this before, rosin really
seems like a dessert to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seemed like a five course meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality of the high and the,
the insulation of the high and how sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thick and, and deep that it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a surface high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is like a four to five course
meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor was the most incredible
strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of you know DNA genetics and you
know the cut strawberry banana,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've probably seen a variety of phenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenol that Concentrated X has picked
and found is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly the photo, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see how bright the bananas and
the strawberries look, that is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very profound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It overtakes your palate very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part of it is on the exhale
where I can't even describe what I feel in
[SPEAKER_00]: my throat, but it almost feels like the
way you feel right before you pass out
[SPEAKER_00]: unconscious, right before you lose
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of, maybe it's a surrender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you're exhaling that Full Melt Bubble,
it left very little chas on the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it cleaned in the dunk tank very
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a little bit of cleaning on this
banger to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite as clean as, you know,
you've got a little bit of buildup of oil
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't get cleaned in the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't get cleaned in the banger
basket, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a nice little high going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was exactly everything that I
remembered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never tasted a better phenol of
strawberry banana and I've never tasted a
[SPEAKER_00]: Full Melt Bubble made from that particular
phenol that was anywhere near what I just
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Concentrated X, my hat is off to you,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for this kind gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've repeated myself 20 times because I'm
just at a loss for words.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a kind gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at it as an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a true bubble ambassador,
spreading the word through the quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: through your phenols hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2025 is going to be a great year for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that and I look forward to getting
to hang out with you one of these days
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: To everyone else that was watching,
go follow Concentrated X on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And may the Full Melt bless you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bowl sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
