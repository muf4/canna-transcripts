[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here at High Integrity Glass Art and
feeling very blessed indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only because I'm standing in front of
the most epic D-nail electric nail table
[SPEAKER_01]: that was ever built.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an absolute joy to be puffing on
this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also there is some incredible quality
Congolese hash rosin just here to my left
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what we're going to be hitting
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't want to turn it too sideways because
there are little shards and I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to drop those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see the quality is on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll throw up some macro photographs just
to give you an idea of the quality of this
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are hitting the one of one punty
depi ball fab with cold work and facet of
[SPEAKER_01]: work on the base, the mouthpiece and the
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a brand new Quave banger in there and
we're actually kind of showcasing which is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty cool when you're hitting such an
incredible one of one piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would think the showcase was obviously
the piece but the showcase is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: this incredibly beautiful innovative
design on a carb cap from JS Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's JS underscore glass if you're
checking them out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure if you can see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of get a little closer for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little update on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see how the tip of it is a little bit
offset.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that allows us to do is while we're
doing a lower temp dab to put this on and
[SPEAKER_01]: spin it around the banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does is it moves the rip and
instead of letting it just sit where the
[SPEAKER_01]: glass or the quartz is cooler it moves it
around consistency and you can really get
[SPEAKER_01]: a pretty substantially better hit using a
carb cap like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to rip it up here right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super blessed and honored to be able
to hit this piece because it's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: one for the books from 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a solid three, three plus years old
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we're going to torch it up and
hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the timer on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at about 15 seconds, probably around
40 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 to 50 seconds depending on how low temp
of the dab you want to rip on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see I've done a close up video
how the resin, well I'll show you in about
[SPEAKER_01]: a second here when I take my rip,
that it really sort of moves around the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of the quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's innovative and that's what I love to
see in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hitting 37 seconds, 38,
39.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I found that was really
cool right off the bat is as I was turning
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you could see sweet spots where if you
turned it too fast it would milk for a
[SPEAKER_01]: second and then stop milking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you brought it back to that spot
and made the oil go over that hot spot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the banger, it just gave this really
lovely, really lovely hit and the taste
[SPEAKER_01]: was on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been puffing out of the sapphire,
which was one of my favorite dishes to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the way it preserves the terpenes
and the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to say, this carb cap with the
Quave banger has given a delicious hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to JS Glass for doing a great
job on creating some innovative new
[SPEAKER_01]: options for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously shout out to Punty and
Deppie and the Mothership crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, High Integrity Glass Art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a pleasure, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for watching Bubble Man's
World and we will talk to you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man, set up the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of strain you have there?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is so clean and clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab,
da-ba-da-ba-da-be.
Dab, dab, dab, dab, da-ba-da-ba-da-be.
Dab, dab, dab, dab, da-ba-da-ba-da-be.
