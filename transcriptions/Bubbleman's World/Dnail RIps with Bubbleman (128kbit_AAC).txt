[SPEAKER_00]: Shaky shaky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a good buddy show up today and bring a
nice variety here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus I still had the dry sift that I made
over with D420K in Prince George.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got back from the house of the great
gardener and brought back some sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: and some barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy brought some Rene dry sifted
like 98% heads as well as some Congolese
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh bubble as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congolese.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured we'd do some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with the Congo dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congo dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congo dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the tool a wipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good etiquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never put a dirty tool into a man's clean
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rule number one potentially of dabbing
etiquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you are wondering can you dab dry
sift in bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all I dab so you absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up Rene dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Rene.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got that close your eyes property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what it is but I'm pretty
sure we used to call it the funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so let's follow that up with some
sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% pure heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made this just the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown by the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some definite dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit the barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is beyond sticky and ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also probably don't need a hit that's
gonna destroy me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider I'm gonna follow it up with
another hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go somewhat reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say somewhat reasonable because we can't
be completely reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway this is what we're dabbing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This absolute ridiculousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if we can share that with you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to give you a little bit of a lowdown
on these hits that I've just taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started with the Congolese which is
just a really beautiful exotic African
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very euphoric and uplifting and sativa-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes you feel real positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Followed that up with a Rene dry sift hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry sift Rene is rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see it too often but when you do
you get that full body of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I can't say they were washed away
in the water process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really the Rene that first showed
me what alcohol soluble terpenes were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a great rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rene's always strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruity smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hazy overtones in the smoke afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Followed that up by sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some 99% heads that I cleaned over with
the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown by them to darn near perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That rip actually was the one that I took
the break after.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very good hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And followed that up with the Barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Barb is the Afghani crossed with
the shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shishka berry was from the red
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were two Afghanis used in the
original creation of shishka.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a red line and a yellow line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red line was the one that was used
in the creation of the shishka berry that
[SPEAKER_00]: was used in the Barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going to finish it off now with a
little of D420K's OG Kush dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was actually made by him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smoked by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well thanks for joining me for some hits
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
