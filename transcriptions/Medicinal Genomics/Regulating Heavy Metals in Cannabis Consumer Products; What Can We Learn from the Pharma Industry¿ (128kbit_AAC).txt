[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a small, intimate audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Robert Thomas, and I have my
own consulting business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I serve the educational leads of the
cannabis industry, particularly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field of heavy metal determinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in this field for almost 50
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about three years ago, I ventured into
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little chaotic, but something that I
love working in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'm going to focus on heavy
metals in cannabis products and what we
[SPEAKER_00]: can learn from the pharmaceutical
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'd like to thank the
organizers for inviting me to contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: to this session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to acknowledge the financial
support of Shimazu Scientific Instruments
[SPEAKER_00]: for allowing me to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let me dive straight in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rough overview of my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with the current status of
heavy metal regulations for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the fractured nature of a
state-based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll give you an historical
perspective of how the pharmaceutical and
[SPEAKER_00]: dietary supplement industries approach
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll address what the cannabis
industry can learn from the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, particularly with the risk
assessment approach that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry took to bring in
meaningful elemental impurity regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: in drug products and substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll get my crystal ball out and
give you my thoughts of where I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry is going with regard to
heavy metals and elemental impurities.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so where is cannabis legal in the US
today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a map.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly current.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light green states represent states
where medicinal cannabis is legal and dark
[SPEAKER_00]: green where both medicinal and recreation
is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is legal for medicinal purposes in 18
states, but the heavy metal regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: are very fractured and very disjointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me give you a brief look,
a snapshot of heavy metal regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the majority of the 37 states in the US
regulates the big four, lead, cadmium,
[SPEAKER_00]: arsenic, and mercury.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York adds nickel, chromium,
copper, zinc, and antimony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland, Missouri, and a few other states
add chromium to the big four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan also includes inorganic arsenic
and not total arsenic, but also adds
[SPEAKER_00]: chromium, copper, and nickel to the big
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states require heavy metals in the
cannabis plant, while others give
[SPEAKER_00]: different limits for the different
delivery methods, which is oral inhalation
[SPEAKER_00]: and transdermal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states stipulate consumption per day,
while others take into consideration the
[SPEAKER_00]: body weight of the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states have no heavy metal limits at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it begs the question, what does New
York State know that all the other states
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they add an additional five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does Michigan regulate inorganic
arsenic, where all the other states just
[SPEAKER_00]: specify total arsenic?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all questions which are
unknown, and there's no real resolution to
[SPEAKER_00]: them, but they are just the fractured
nature of state-based systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bottom line is that we have to
look at these state-based systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: consider whether it's worth improving
them, expanding the elemental panel that's
[SPEAKER_00]: currently in place today, or maybe looking
at speciated analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are sort of questions which need to
have answers to, I think, before
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually federal regulators come along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this table is a list of the nine
elements that are regulated by the states
[SPEAKER_00]: in the left-hand column, and going across
from left to right, the first three
[SPEAKER_00]: columns are USP Chapter 232 PDE limits for
drug products, Chapter 2232 limits for
[SPEAKER_00]: dietary supplements, the American Herbal
Pharmacopeia limits for botanicals and
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal products, and then going across six
different states, California, Cobalt,
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland, New York, Connecticut,
and Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few things to point out, the federal
limits are based on micrograms per day,
[SPEAKER_00]: so with most states, pharmaceuticals,
they have a maximum dosage or a suggested
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data in the first three columns
must be divided by the suggested dosage
[SPEAKER_00]: for those particular products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, if 10 gram is the maximum
consumption per day, they must be divided
[SPEAKER_00]: by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the state-based limits,
you'll find that some are in microgram per
[SPEAKER_00]: gram, some are in part per million,
and some of them are in milligram per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you're an analytical chemist and
you're used to dealing with different
[SPEAKER_00]: units, as a consumer and other people who
are working in this field, they might not
[SPEAKER_00]: have a good understanding of how these
limits are the same or are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the state-based limits
and compare them with the federal limits,
[SPEAKER_00]: just taking lead as an example,
which is in the top row in red,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see they are all very different,
and this is fairly typical of most states
[SPEAKER_00]: in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we take a look first at the
federal limits and then at a few
[SPEAKER_00]: state-based limits, and we'll try and get
a better understanding of what needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the first slide, the federal
limits for USP Chapter 232 for elemental
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities in drug products and
substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: ICHQ3D are similar limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: ICHQ3D is a consortium of pharmaceutical
manufacturers in other parts of the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: including pharmacopeers from the U.S.,
from Japan, and from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the USP and the ICH aligned their
methodology together during the 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: it took to actually bring these limits
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of points to emphasize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The class or the category is the toxicity
classification of each of those elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll talk more about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, these are three,
they are based on three different delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: methods or administration methods,
oral, parenteral, and inhalation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are in microgram per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need to know what's allowed in
the actual product, you divide by the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's 10 grams, for example,
you divide those by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's important to understand
that these, it took a total of 20 years to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring these into the public domain,
and I'll talk a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of the pharmaceutical industry,
particularly United States Pharmacopeia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they arrived at that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is Chapter 2232.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the limit for dietary
supplements and nutraceuticals only.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find there's only four,
not 24, and there's a reason behind that,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'll explain later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you might notice is that for
arsenic and mercury, they require
[SPEAKER_00]: speciated forms of the arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that inorganic arsenic is more
toxic than organic arsenic, and because
[SPEAKER_00]: many plants and herbal supplements are
grown from plants, the requirement here is
[SPEAKER_00]: if the total arsenic is above the PDE
limit per day, you have to speciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find out what is inorganic and
what is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that pentavalent and trivalent
arsenic is extremely toxic compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: organic arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The acino sugars and monomethyl arsenic
acid, they are toxic, but they're not as
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic as inorganic arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with mercury, because many dietary
supplements are made from kelp products or
[SPEAKER_00]: fish oil, there's a likelihood of there
being high mercury in some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: products, mainly because mercury,
once it gets into aquatic systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: is consumed by bottom feeders,
and then it bio-accumulates up the food
[SPEAKER_00]: chain, and the predator fish have much
higher mercury levels in them than the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a chance in a dietary
supplement that's made from kelp or a fish
[SPEAKER_00]: oil, it could contain high levels of
mercury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's look at a few of the states
for comparison purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked California, because we're in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it'd be a good one to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're categorized by two different
categories, inhalable cannabis goods and
[SPEAKER_00]: all other cannabis goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are in microgram per gram,
and these are actually the same as USP
[SPEAKER_00]: chapter 232 for inhalation drugs and oral
drugs based on 10 gram of consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's fair to say that we have
no way of really knowing in what
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities people consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is 10 gram a realistic dosage?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe it is, but we don't
really know how people consume cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and in what quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what's unique about the
California regulations is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: require a half a gram of sample to digest,
to carry out the heavy metal
[SPEAKER_00]: determination, where most other states
don't put a stipulation on the minimum
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Colorado, they're a little bit
different to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically they're categorized in three
different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Substance, which is the heavy metal of
concern, the acceptable limits per gram of
[SPEAKER_00]: intended use, and then the products to be
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few points to emphasize here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inhaled products are derived from USP
chapter 232 inhalation PDEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The topical or transdermal limits are
based on FDA limits for cosmetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the oral consumption limits are based
on chapter 2232 for dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colorado has taken an approach of using
many, many different sources to regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is rather unusual because you need to
know the body weight of the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: before you know the maximum allowable
limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Connecticut, this is a microgram per
kilogram of body weight per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's typical to use 60 to 70 kilogram
as an average body weight for a human,
[SPEAKER_00]: both male and female, but you don't know
the suggested dosage per day, so you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: work out the maximum allowable limit in
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is a study that was put out by
the FDA recently, the botanical review
[SPEAKER_00]: team of the Office of New Drug Products at
the US FDA, and they looked at eight
[SPEAKER_00]: different medical cannabis programs,
state-based medical cannabis programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and compared them with the federal limits
of USP chapter 232.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look in the left-hand column,
you see the four heavy metals of concern,
[SPEAKER_00]: USP chapter 232 inhalation limits,
and chapter 232 oral limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going across the table, you will see
the limits for eight different state-based
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell you which states they are,
they just call them MCP128.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, the data in red shows
inconsistency and are higher than the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal USP chapter 232 limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's quite common across all the
different medical cannabis programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this study came to three conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said testing for these four heavy
metals in inhalation and oral drugs was
[SPEAKER_00]: lacking in the majority of MCPs,
it was about 75%, and even when present,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were inconsistent across programs,
and finally, they did not always align
[SPEAKER_00]: with USP recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this shows the fractured and the
disjointed nature of state-based limits
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to federal limits for
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's tell you a little bit about
United States Pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked very closely with the United
States Pharmacopeia over the past 15 to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work on the ACS committee for reagent
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lead the heavy metal task force.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when USP was writing its methodology
for elemental impurities in
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals, our ACS committee worked
very closely to align the method we were
[SPEAKER_00]: working on for heavy metals with the
method that USP was working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who are the USP?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is their mission?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's an independent, non-profit,
and it's not part of the government,
[SPEAKER_00]: although they do work with various
government agencies around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their mission is to improve the health
of people through public standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these public standards are known as
United States Pharmacopeia National
[SPEAKER_00]: Formulary, or USP, NF for short,
and it's a book of compendial standards
[SPEAKER_00]: for drug substances and products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been around for about 200
years, and they're recognized in about 130
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the FDA designates the USP-NF as the
official compendium of drugs sold and
[SPEAKER_00]: marketed in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what is the USP process to change
a standard method or a monograph?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a process which is a little bit
cumbersome in nature because it revises
[SPEAKER_00]: standards through a unique public
collaborative process with scientists in
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, in academia, in standards
organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ACS was one of the interested
stakeholders in the way the USP would
[SPEAKER_00]: change in their methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lead the heavy metals task force at
the ACS, so we work very closely with them
[SPEAKER_00]: as we were both changing our methodology
for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk a little bit more about the
methodology in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had been around for 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a colorimetric precipitation test
which was semi-quantitative at best,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it didn't give you any indication of
the individual heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the USP method was described in USP
Chapter 231, and in the ACS we developed
[SPEAKER_00]: it, put it into a book of reagent
chemicals, and both methods were very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because ACS-grade reagent chemicals
are recommended by the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacopeia in any analytical procedures,
we had to make sure that our method
[SPEAKER_00]: aligned exactly with the USP method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that process took a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a lot longer by USP, but we wanted
to make sure that whatever USP was doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ACS method was aligned with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left-hand side, you see the book
of reagent chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be a hardback book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now completely online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a database, a searchable database,
so it's available anywhere in the world at
[SPEAKER_00]: any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can search any monograph which is
in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on that, United States
Pharmacopeia, in their general notices and
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements, recommends that if any
pharmaceutical manufacturers are using
[SPEAKER_00]: reagent chemicals for testing procedures,
they must be ACS-grade reagent chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the reason we work very closely
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let me explain briefly what USP
Chapter 231 is, which is very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: the ACS test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on a sulfide calorimetric
precipitation test with an organic sulfide
[SPEAKER_00]: at a pH of three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, you precipitate the
heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes down as a sulfide, and it makes a
very cloudy colloidal-type suspension
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our ACS test was very similar to the
USP test, except we used hydrogen sulfide
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of an organosulfide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both were semi-quantitative at best
and probably qualitative, really,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you only made the comparison
against a lead standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter how many elements you were
trying to assess in a sample, you were
[SPEAKER_00]: only comparing it against a lead standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, it had many limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at those limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide shows 12 different sulfide
precipitates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can imagine all 12 of those
elements were present in the same sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: how difficult it would be to compare a
combined precipitate against a lead
[SPEAKER_00]: standard, which is circled in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was nonspecific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only gave you an approximation of what
elements, what heavy metals were present
[SPEAKER_00]: in your sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also had a lousy detection capability,
limit of quantitation about 5 ppm,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is totally inadequate by today's
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It required a high sample weight,
about 5 gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the accuracy was dependent on the
experience of the analyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone who had been doing it for years
would normally get a better assessment
[SPEAKER_00]: than someone who just started doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was clearly a matter of method that
needed to be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was quite surprising that it did
last over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1908, it was developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the timeline to adopt these
changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: It started in 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USP Pharmacomputer Forum identified
issues with chapter 231.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2000, an article in the journal
Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated ICP-MS as an alternative
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't for another four years when
Nancy Liu and co-workers at Bristol Myers
[SPEAKER_00]: Squibb came out with a method,
a study, which compared ICP-MS against
[SPEAKER_00]: chapter 231 and so showed serious
limitations in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it took another 12 years for the
USP to get their act together through
[SPEAKER_00]: various expert committees, working groups,
stakeholder meetings, which the ACS were
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with to discuss this change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in January 2018, USP came out
with chapters 232 for element and
[SPEAKER_00]: imperialism in drugs and chapter 233,
which was the methodology used using
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma spectrochemistry together with
microwave digestion procedures and
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive validation protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter 2232, by the way, came out a
couple of years before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that came into the public domain a
couple of years earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example of the limitations of
chapter 231, here's a slide in comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: recoveries of USP chapter 231 method
against ICP-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: ICP-MS is in red, chapter 231 is in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the majority of the elements
by chapter 231 are less than 50% recovery,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of them are less than 10%
recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mercury, there was no recovery at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mercury is a very volatile element unless
you're very careful with sample
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can completely lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just showed the limitations of
chapter 231.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that point on, 2018, ICP-MS and
ICP-OES became the standard method to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did, they separated out the
PDE limits for pharmaceuticals only.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call this chapter 232.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a separate chapter for dietary
supplements because that's the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: were regulated in other parts of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call this chapter 2232, and they
implemented a totally different chapter
[SPEAKER_00]: for the analytical methodology,
which included ICP-OES or ICP-MS,
[SPEAKER_00]: microwave digestion, and comprehensive
validation protocols using spike recovery
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the potential sources of
elemental impurities in drug compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the process they went through to
find out what were the potential sources
[SPEAKER_00]: and what was the toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The toxicity of the elements, which could
be found somewhere in the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, they separated that into
four different categories, four different
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elements intentionally added as a part of
the manufacturing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of that would be platinum group
catalyst elements in the organic synthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: of many drug substances or APIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, elements that are not intentionally
added, and that could be something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: in a that's in an excipient such as talcum
powder, which is used as a tablet
[SPEAKER_00]: compression aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And talcum powder is basically magnesium
silicate, which is dug out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know if anything is mined or dug
out of the ground, it can potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: contain high levels of transition and
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third category was elemental
impurities that can be introduced from
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with the manufacturing equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And examples of that are iron,
chromium, and nickel.
[SPEAKER_00]: From stainless steel containers and
vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, elemental impurities that
could leach out of the drug substance from
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic containers and closure systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that some plastics are dirty than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that some glassware is dirty
than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the enclosure of the packaging
system was based on plastic or glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a chance of metals leaching out
of that into the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line was that regulators
required all pharmaceutical manufacturers
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a comprehensive understanding of
the manufacturing process and to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: where the contact points for those various
metals were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually, and categorize those
elements by their toxicity classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll explain that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so toxicity classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's chapter 232, a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now microgram, okay, not microgram
per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is now microgram per gram in the
pharmaceutical product based on 10 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: of maximum of suggested dosage per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the second column, you'll see
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, every element of those 24 elemental
impurities was classified by the toxicity
[SPEAKER_00]: classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb,
and Class III.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a few changes recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones in red are the ones that they
changed very recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the past 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this version of chapter 232 that I
downloaded still had those in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's look at the toxicity
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, Class I were elements including
the classic heavy metals, lead,
[SPEAKER_00]: cadmium arsenic, and mercury, which are
human toxicants and have no use in the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture of drugs whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: These should be monitored at all times and
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Class IIa elements were also toxic,
but not as toxic as Class I, but they had
[SPEAKER_00]: a high probability of occurrence in the
drug product and should also be evaluated
[SPEAKER_00]: at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Class IIb elements were the
elements which have a reduced probability
[SPEAKER_00]: but should only be monitored if they were
present in the manufacturing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example of that would be the platinum
group metals using catalysts in the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic synthesis of many drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Class III elements, which have a
relatively low abundance toxicity by the
[SPEAKER_00]: oral route, but would warrant
justification for inhalation drugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: those used for intravenous purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that as background information,
this is the process that USP took to
[SPEAKER_00]: categorize the 24 elemental impurities
which are required in all pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: products today, up to 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's based on a risk assessment
approach to see what contaminants are
[SPEAKER_00]: present and the likelihood of them being
present in the manufacturing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we now take a jump into cannabis
products, we can see that the first area
[SPEAKER_00]: of concern is cultivation, of course,
and we fully understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the plants are grown outdoors,
the soil chemistry has to be assessed and
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to do that because we
know that cannabis and hemp are
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperaccumulators of all contaminants in
the soil, whether it's heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic elements, you know, radionuclides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that after Chernobyl in 1986,
hemp was planted to clean up the
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated soil in Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that through anthropogenic
activities, there's been a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental pollution over the year from
mining, from metal refineries,
[SPEAKER_00]: petrochemical plants, coal fired power
plants, and there's a whole slew of
[SPEAKER_00]: elements where there's compelling evidence
in the public domain that the cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp plants are absorbing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know lead in particular is of great
concern because our decades of using lead
[SPEAKER_00]: based materials included leaded gasoline,
leaded paint, and leaded water pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that soil near major highways
contains much higher levels of lead than
[SPEAKER_00]: soil away from major highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that leaded paint can be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a house that was built in 1747.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we moved in, we had to get a crew
in to completely remove the lead paint
[SPEAKER_00]: from the window sills and the paint on the
walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a major, major problem,
but we had two young children at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was something that we were
extremely concerned about because lead
[SPEAKER_00]: paint was used for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lead water pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw what happened in Flint,
Michigan back a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless you have a clean water supply,
if you're using water for your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and hemp, whatever's in the water,
clearly there's a high chance it'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that fertilizers are made from
phosphate rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphate fertilizers can potentially
contain high levels of heavy metals and
[SPEAKER_00]: transition metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be really particular about
the quality of fertilizers and nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that we use on cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that fish emulsion and fish
extracts are being used nowadays as
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, particularly for indoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the fact that we know that
fish, based on bioaccumulation of mercury,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's mercury spewing out from,
say, a power plant, then it ends up in an
[SPEAKER_00]: aquatic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the predator, the large fish,
will have much, much higher levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: mercury.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those fish are used for fish emulsions
as nutrients for indoor plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a good chance that that mercury
will be transferred to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know it's in the public domain that
growth enhancers are being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, nickel salts are used to
enhance bud size, and silicates are used
[SPEAKER_00]: for shoot strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Point I'm making is that the majority of
these elements would escape the scrutiny
[SPEAKER_00]: of state-based regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know, if it's present
there, you're never gonna find it because
[SPEAKER_00]: most states just regulate the big four.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in New York, maybe Michigan,
and maybe a few other states, you might
[SPEAKER_00]: find chromium, but the majority of these
elements are not being regulated today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next source is extraction and
processing and manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a potential source as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the cultivation process has given you a
plant which is highly contaminated or
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly contaminated, the extraction
process is not gonna remove those heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's in the flower or the biomass,
there's a very high chance it will be in
[SPEAKER_00]: an extracted cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that depending on the
extraction process will dictate how much
[SPEAKER_00]: metal is extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know, again, it's in the public
domain, that certainly some solvents,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the flows and the pressure
and the temperature, will produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: different extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will be more efficient, some will be
less efficient, but there has to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: balance between efficiency of cannabinoid
extraction and taking contaminants out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a balance to be made there,
and it's something which I think is a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential concern going forward because
maybe efficiency of the cannabinoid is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the major factor behind
extraction and maybe not so concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: about the elemental or any contaminants
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's some serious concern
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the processing of grinding equipment,
again, from stainless steel, chromium,
[SPEAKER_00]: nickel and iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember a case in my state,
Maryland, where a processor was using
[SPEAKER_00]: stainless steel scissors and they were
finding high levels of chromium in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was coming from the stainless steel
scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable, but it was true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, finally, storage and delivery
devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass dropper bottles, for example,
if they're made of borosilicate glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, guaranteed you'll be taking heavy
metals out of the surface of the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quartz should be used or a higher
purity glass, but definitely not
[SPEAKER_00]: borosilicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there are bongs made of glass,
they should be made of high purity or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least made of quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not borosilicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inks are notorious for being lead-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of lead-based inks out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example recently where a study was
done looking at extract in a graduated
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle, and what was happening was the
extract was dissolving the lead-based ink
[SPEAKER_00]: and ending up in the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did some studies over time,
and they ended up with some of the samples
[SPEAKER_00]: were 30 to 50 part per million,
with a regulated limit for lead in that
[SPEAKER_00]: state was 0.5 part per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things are not fully understood,
and things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, before you know it,
you have a contaminated product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could spend an entire talk about
vape pens, but basically, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff coming in from overseas,
from China in particular, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain various metallic components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're vaping at temperatures,
you're going to be, you know, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be corroding the inside of those
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that based on elevated aerosol
vaping temperatures, that you're not only
[SPEAKER_00]: corroding the metal from the internal
components, but it's existing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate form.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been work done, which is using
scanning electron microscopy and energy
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersive XRF, which is showing small
particles of metal in the aerosol which
[SPEAKER_00]: correlates with what was in the vaping
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a couple of, there's been
some sort of product recalls over the past
[SPEAKER_00]: few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of look for them because that's
what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my thing, heavy metals, to understand
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've counted 15, in the past 12
months, I've counted 15 recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there are more, but they're
the only ones that are in the public
[SPEAKER_00]: domain that I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's five of them up on the screen
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two were in Florida, one was in Hawaii,
one in Maryland, one in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two involved vape pens in Hawaii and
Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Michigan, involved cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Florida, it involved CBD extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all examples of limits
exceeding the state-based regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum allowable limits for a whole bunch
of elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the one in Florida is going
through litigation at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are getting into the public domain,
which are, you know, which are unsafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting to see whether,
if the regulations were tighter,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that would be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me give you my final thoughts on
regulating heavy metals in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current list of four heavy metals is
clearly inadequate, absolutely inadequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying the 24 regulated by the
pharmaceutical industry, that might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little of an overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can tell you that elements,
contaminants, derived from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, manufacturing, storage,
delivery process would warrant at least
[SPEAKER_00]: another 10 elements on top of the big
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a future list of elemental
contaminants in cannabis worthy of
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I say worthy of consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do a risk assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do an assessment study of which
ones are actually in the cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm saying that at least a list of 15
elements based on the big four,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus the additional elements in Maryland,
Michigan, and New York, plus initial six,
[SPEAKER_00]: from compelling evidence in the public
domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bottom line is these, most of
these would escape the scrutiny of state
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so there's signs that the industry
is moving towards an extended panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, three examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: NIST is coming out with a certified
reference material for NIST for six,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 toxic elements in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a certified reference material
which will be available this time this
[SPEAKER_00]: year sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly know when.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly enough, the list is
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes uranium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen early NIST data which shows
there's about half a PPM in a hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit on an ASTM D37 committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're writing a method for ICPMS for
cannabis and hemp consumer products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we include 23 elemental contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, USP has just published a
draft monograph for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: For use as an API.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is only for use as an API in drugs
like Epidiolex or drugs that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: through the approval pipeline by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to comply with that, you have to show
compliance for up to 24 elemental
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe the CBD market will separate
out into the really pure stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: really clean stuff that's used as an API
for pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of the stuff which is
probably 95% at the moment will be used
[SPEAKER_00]: for other purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to finish with a source of
information for my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written three textbooks in this
domain on the applications and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamentals of ICPMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is a practical guide to
ICPMS which came out in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one was measuring elemental
impurities in pharmaceuticals which came
[SPEAKER_00]: out in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my final one I've written,
they just came out with a paperback
[SPEAKER_00]: version of that is measuring heavy metal
contaminants in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all available on Amazon or through
my publishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hot off the press, I had an article
published in Analytical Cannabis Today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a four part series on the benefits of
carrying out a comprehensive risk
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment study to better understand
elemental impurities in cannabis and drug
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be published over the next
few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've gone over but I think we
started late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time and I'll gladly
answer any of your questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very nice talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot from you today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I basically want to ask the same question
that I asked to the previous speaker who
[SPEAKER_02]: was talking about pediatric use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering now with the right now we
have the regulation at different states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of them focus on the big four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of them, there is no
difference between recreational and
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's for people who are sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I just want to see your thought on
should there be a difference between the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation for the toxic element
regulation for medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: medical versus recreational cannabis given
that of course we do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now the information is so scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really know what is out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the patient, should there be a
difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there should, then how should we
proceed to there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean I would say that my state,
for example, Maryland currently only
[SPEAKER_00]: allows medicinal cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they will be approving recreational
use next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're concerned that bringing in
recreational use will affect the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: and the purity of the medicinal drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think based on the fact that I've
done a lot of work in the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry which is highly regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly the pharmaceutical industry
was very concerned about producing
[SPEAKER_00]: products which potentially could contain
heavy metals which they weren't even
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it took them 20 years,
clearly they saw a need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not only a need to do it, they needed
to comprehensively understand where the
[SPEAKER_00]: contact points for the heavy metals were
in the entire manufacturing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now every pharmaceutical manufacturer
has to show compliance for up to 24
[SPEAKER_00]: elemental impurities based on the method
of delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've come from that kind of background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've come into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see an industry which is chaotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's so fractured and disjointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see that recreational use
cannabis has exactly the same limits as
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal use, to me it doesn't make any
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean for example, I'm working with a
group at the moment that they suffer from
[SPEAKER_00]: adult epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found relief in vaping CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And okay, they approached me because they
were concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They read in the open literature that
these vaping devices were showing high
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of elemental contaminants in the
aerosol which were not being regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the metallic components within
these vaping devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though they tried conventional
drugs for their seizures and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: finding relief in this CBG in particular,
they were extremely concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm helping them maybe find a source
of these vaping devices which are cleaner,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are less contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I see now there being these vaping
devices separating up into the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: are used for the masses which are coming
in the millions from China and ones which
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna be used for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot use the ones coming in from
China because I've seen some data which is
[SPEAKER_00]: scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give someone who's taking CBG for a
seizure and the CBG is relieving their
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms, but they put in particulates of
chromium down their lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean to me that's so scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I've been immersed in this area
for the past three years and I see the
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes the industry is making and I'm
trying to help them get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very frustrating, but working with
groups like ASTM and AOAC, I think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: making some headway, but there's a lot of
stuff going on which needs to change,
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regarding the vaporizers, I believe in
2019 there was a presentation here where
[SPEAKER_01]: they went into a lot of detail on the
elemental testing of the vapor coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed to come to a different
conclusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they said it was fairly low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just curious if you had any
insights why that was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you're not talking about the Ivali
scare in 2019 with vitamin E acetate,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you talking about that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I believe they were looking at metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: The presentation here in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that was the Ivali scare.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ivali scare where the vitamin E
acetate was getting into consumers' lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: and killed about 70 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's been a lot of work done over
the past few years in characterizing
[SPEAKER_00]: vaping or aerosol for elemental
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there is no standard method
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very complex analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you're dealing with diluents,
you're dealing with cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dealing with hydrophobic and
hydrophytic liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you take the aerosol and allow it
to make a condensate and take a
[SPEAKER_00]: representative part of that condensate and
introduce it into your analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: technique, which is typically ICP-MS?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you be sure you've taken a
representative sample from the tank
[SPEAKER_00]: because the different temperatures,
the elemental contaminants have different
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporization temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the vaporization temperature,
some of the less volatile elements might
[SPEAKER_00]: not come over and some of the more
volatile elements will come over first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you know what your sampling is
representative of what's in the tank?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very complex analysis and there's
no standardized method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states are trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is leading the charge,
but I know they're having some challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can't give this analysis to a
regular testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult for someone who's had years
of experience in trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the analysis, virtually
impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm not critiquing the testing labs
because there's some really good ones out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but this analysis is so difficult,
so challenging, and you have to throw in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you also have to throw in a smoke machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you know that the puff profile
of a cannabis consumer is very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: an e-cigarette user or a nicotine user?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the work that's been done up to now
has been done on e-cigarettes,
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine devices, and all of a sudden
you're then going to a cannabis device and
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis vapor as a different puff
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so complicated and so difficult
that I think it'll be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
