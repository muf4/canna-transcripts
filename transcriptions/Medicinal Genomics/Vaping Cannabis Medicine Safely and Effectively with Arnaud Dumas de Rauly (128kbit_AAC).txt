[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_01]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we needed a little R&R following
the CanMed 23 innovation and investment
[SPEAKER_01]: summit last month.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot goes into running a successful
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully, we have an amazing team
that made it all happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to the Medicinal Genomics team
for all their work this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a special shout out goes to the core
CanMed team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug Kennedy, Taylor Watson, Sam
Hindmarsh, Steve Daley, Denise Marston,
[SPEAKER_01]: Frank Pascaro, and Megan Howard,
thank you for everything that you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were able to make the trip to Marco
Island this year, I hope you had a great
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feedback that we've gotten so far has
been overwhelmingly positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The presentations, networking
opportunities, food, accommodations,
[SPEAKER_01]: even the weather was top notch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't wait to do it all again next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of next year, we are working out
the dates and the details as I record
[SPEAKER_01]: this, and I will share that information
with you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't already, go to CanMedEvents

[SPEAKER_01]: That way you will not miss the
announcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you didn't make it to CanMed this
year, I am happy to tell you that video
[SPEAKER_01]: recordings of all 28 oral presentations
have now been added to the CanMed archive
[SPEAKER_01]: page on CanMedEvents.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can still learn from all the
leaders in the cannabis industry without
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving home.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those presenters is my guest today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arno Dumas de Roli is a leading expert in
the science, technology, and supply chain
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis vaping merchandise.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the co-founder and CEO of The Blink
Group, a company that is transforming the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis vaping industry with its focus on
safety, innovation, and quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arno's assistance and expertise in the
vaping sector have been requested by
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple regulatory bodies across the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across North America, Europe, and Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: He currently works as chairman of the ISO
International Organization of
[SPEAKER_01]: Standardization on Vaping Products,
and on the CEN Standards Committee on
[SPEAKER_01]: Vapor Products.
[SPEAKER_01]: At CanMed23, Arno talked about the many
variables that affect how well cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: vape cartridges deliver cannabinoids to
the user.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can view that video using the link in
the show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: During our conversation, we dig deeper
into the following topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should consumers and patients be
looking at when choosing vape products?
[SPEAKER_01]: The symbiotic relationship between
cannabis oil and vape hardware.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why emissions testing is important to
understand what the user is inhaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast difference of aerosolization
rates for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: How federal legalization may change
cannabis vape regulations and
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, tips for patients who want to
vape their medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Arno, I want to thank this episode's

[SPEAKER_01]: Dumas de Roli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Arno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always happy to contribute to the CanMed
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to talk with you today
about vaping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your presentation at CanMed 23 had a lot
of really interesting points that I know
[SPEAKER_01]: you really weren't able to dive into due
to time restrictions, but here we are
[SPEAKER_01]: today and hoping we can get into it in a
little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe before we start, I wanted to ask
you about patients who vape their medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: because you mentioned patients throughout
the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be honest, when I speak with
doctors on the podcast, they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: typically mention vaping as their
preferred delivery method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have a sense of what percentage
of patients vape their medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you look at the percentage of
sales, you've got roughly 30% of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers use vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you look at the regulatory
schemes in different states, New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance, where I'm headquartered,
was a solely vaping state until roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: three to four years ago, where they
started allowing other forms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical program, other forms of use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the main reasons that was
the case is because when you create
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts, you control more what's inside,
so therefore you control more what comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it and you have a better
granularity in terms of effects-based
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe historically that's why
some of these states only allowed vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we also have the example of other
states that don't allow vape, where
[SPEAKER_00]: provinces like Quebec and Canada does not
allow vapes because of the vape scare and
[SPEAKER_00]: the conflict in information with nicotine
vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is still something I don't understand
to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicotine vaping is a wonderful harm
reduction tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got countries in Europe that
reimburse users that switch from smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: to vaping a certain amount every year to
buy new vaping gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's only really in North America
where vaping is chastised.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm assuming, and it was very clear
when watching the video of your
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation that not all vape carts are
equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of different variables
that go into how much cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_01]: being delivered to the consumer or even
the quality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what should consumers or patients be
paying attention to when they're choosing
[SPEAKER_01]: a vape cart?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most important thing to
understand when you're using a vaping
[SPEAKER_00]: product is the transparency that the
producer is offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there COAs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the brand of the manufacturer of that
vape cart present?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a serial number on the vape
cartridge, usually underneath?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a unique serial number?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any testing that's provided on
the raw materials of that cartridge
[SPEAKER_00]: itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, the glass outside or the
centre post or the mouthpiece what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing has been done on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a consumer or as a patient,
what kind of testing do I have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: to evaluate if this product is good for me
or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I guess I'll put that question
back onto you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how immediately apparent is it when I
mean, I know from my experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I go to a dispensary and I'm looking at
a vape cart, I mean, until I saw your
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation, I didn't even know I needed
to look or that I should.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it easy to see on the packaging to
know kind of what sort of hardware is
[SPEAKER_01]: being used?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends really on what packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on which brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some brands really embrace the fact that
they're working with reputable hardware
[SPEAKER_00]: and are willing to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some others just put a cartridge in a mini
exit bag and don't put any more info.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean that the product isn't
good, but what what what you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand is that the cartridge itself
out of maybe what a sixty dollar sixty
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar vape device, the cartridge itself
is anywhere between two and three dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost, the rest is really the cost of
the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes the cartridge is considered
more of a commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you really look at the science of
it, it can't be considered a commodity
[SPEAKER_00]: because the hardware and the oil is
totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a symbiotic relationship between
the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't test one and not the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the best oil that has ever
been created with the best effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more consistent flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in a bad device, it'll be a bad
experience for the consumer and vice
[SPEAKER_00]: versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the best device and you put
a distillate that's cut with loads of
[SPEAKER_00]: products, you're going to have the best
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a bad consumer
experience as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to work with reputable
brands and and ask questions as a patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a consumer, ask questions to the but
tender as the but tender been educated by
[SPEAKER_00]: the brand has or do they have handouts
available on what is the best temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: to use the device at or what is the best
voltage on the battery that comes with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's also one of the reasons
why we saw an uptick starting last year in
[SPEAKER_00]: sales of disposable vapes, because as much
as it's not really sustainable,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're working with a recycle
recyclable vape, we we can control the
[SPEAKER_00]: user experience a lot better and avoid a
lot of those end user or patient mistakes
[SPEAKER_00]: of plugging a cartridge into a battery
that's not made for that cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prevalence of of of disposables has
really increased over the past year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not primarily just a convenience
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that the producer can actually
control the experience a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we have a hard time
explaining to our clients at the Blink
[SPEAKER_00]: Group is really, guys, you can't just buy
any cartridge off the market because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the companies in in in more traditional
markets like California, like Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: will go online on Alibaba, DHgate and say,
oh, look, I can buy a cartridge for
[SPEAKER_00]: seventy five cents and really don't care
about what's inside, where what's inside
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to influence the consumer
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, really important that that
companies, brands, MSOs really understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the importance of the hardware and don't
solely choose on price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love this idea of the symbiotic
relationship between the oil and the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it a case to where you might have
different hardware requirements for
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of oils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's different oils have
different viscosities.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good rule of thumb is that distillate is
is is pretty viscous in terms of CPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're looking at anywhere between 50
and one hundred thousand CPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at what CPS centipoise,
it's the measure of a viscosity of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we are looking at live resin,
we're usually on some lower viscosities
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've got some either recombined
terpenes in there or the terpenes have
[SPEAKER_00]: been re-added back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're on a product that's a little bit
more liquidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we look at live rosin,
which is solventless, which is pressed,
[SPEAKER_00]: we go back to something very, very thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the the mathematical process of
vaporization is a mix of chemistry,
[SPEAKER_00]: thermodynamics and fluid mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to understand all three of
those to understand which hardware can
[SPEAKER_00]: work better with which oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The added complexity of cannabis is that
it is a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from one batch to the other of the
exact same strain, when you process it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will have different inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trick is really to figure out which
hardware suits which oil the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have we have a great rule of thumb that
our our our run of the mill basic
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge, the V12 is something that would
work very well with distillate and live
[SPEAKER_00]: resin for rosin because you have more of
that full flavor because you have more of
[SPEAKER_00]: that terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to use a different device to make
sure the client or the patient does not
[SPEAKER_00]: heat it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we increase the resistance,
for instance, to be usable on the run of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mill batteries that you'd be buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also look at the intake hole size
because that will measure the rate at
[SPEAKER_00]: which the oil is going to feed the coil to
turn into vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, the thicker the oil,
the bigger holes you need to allow more of
[SPEAKER_00]: that to seep in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's a lot more I'm trying to
hit it really high level, but there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more that goes that goes into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the the the performance of the
vape cartridges on the market can
[SPEAKER_00]: literally be divided by 10 or multiplied
by 10 by changing one of those variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And given that that fact and that you were
saying, you know, some processors,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just buying kind of cheap hardware
from Alibaba.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that the performance and quality
of vape carts in the marketplace can vary
[SPEAKER_01]: widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, immensely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some testing with different
viscosities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you take a very, very thick
liquid, you know, like like like honey,
[SPEAKER_00]: like molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use a battery for instance,
at a three point seven volt setting with
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller intake holes, you're essentially
not going to allow enough oil to penetrate
[SPEAKER_00]: the coil fast enough when the coil is
heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the little that has made it
into the coil is going to be burning
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only are you getting bad flavor,
but you're also getting toxic emissions
[SPEAKER_00]: because burning in essence is the same
thing as combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're degrading the terpenes and the
cannabinoids in there and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: ruining the the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on the other hand, if you have too
much oil that goes in it and too much of
[SPEAKER_00]: an intake hole and too much of a big
porosity on the ceramic itself of the
[SPEAKER_00]: coil, you are going to see saturation,
which means which leads to clogging,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means leads to leaking and potential
spit back through the mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very, very important to really
match the hardware to the oil or vice
[SPEAKER_00]: versa and make sure you have a consistent
supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really the other the other
side to this is the consistency of the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that maybe brings up a good point,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably difficult to do in an
audio medium, but as best you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any visuals that you could
use, you can maybe send over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put it in the show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of describe how the mechanism
actually works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how does the oil get into the chamber
to the coil?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be first to admit, maybe I don't
fully understand it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be interesting to give us like
kind of a high level of how the mechanism
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you have the tank where you
that's filled by the processor,
[SPEAKER_00]: fills the oil into that tank on a basic
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a center post.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that center post has holes with a
certain aperture that let that oil
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate into the absorption material,
which in most of the cases is ceramic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That absorption material is then heated
with a coil and the oil that's in there
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say it's vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called aerosol in scientific terms
turns into aerosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very little particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That come up through that chimney of the
center post and that the patient actually
[SPEAKER_00]: inhales afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can easily imagine, the
characteristics of the hardware will
[SPEAKER_00]: define the size of those particles and
will decide the composition of those
[SPEAKER_00]: particles based on different temperature
settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long it was heated?
[SPEAKER_00]: When was the last time it was heated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it had time to cool down?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really a lot of other variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did want to ask you about testing
and about regulations because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something you brought up in the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that you mentioned
is that all the testing regulations are
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, all the testing is being
performed on the oil that's going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridge and not on the emissions that
are coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, Colorado is the only state that
has set up emissions testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been a big part of that and we
really want that to be used everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you test a product for its safety,
you want to test the product that the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer is actually using, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right now we are testing the oil
that's inside a cartridge, but that oil
[SPEAKER_00]: changes state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing as if you would decide
to test the water in your boiler instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of testing the vapor that people are going
to be inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a safety standpoint, from a
consumer standpoint, it makes way more
[SPEAKER_00]: sense to be testing the vapor that comes
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because there is a change of state,
it turns into an aerosol from a liquid to
a liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really why we strongly believe
in pushing emissions testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the performance testing we do
on our devices have the end goal in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is to provide a consistent user
experience from start to finish of that
[SPEAKER_00]: device, whether it's a cartridge,
whether it's a pod system, whether it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: all in one disposable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our end goal is really to provide that
consistent delivery of those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we talk about cannabinoids,
that's really what makes this exercise
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cannabinoids have different points of
aerosolization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have CBN for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have CBN in a vape, they're usually
using gummies to help with sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're using vapes in a regular
cartridge, usually when you're done with
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of your cartridge, the CBN is
completely gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another effect that we've seen with
most of the cartridges on the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: because obviously we don't test just our
own, is the fact that THCA and various
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabinoids actually increase in
availability in the vapor throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: lifespan of the cartridge, because those
are basically the only ones left.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, terpenes have a lower boiling
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're using a live resin at the
end of the cartridge, you're not gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really just gonna get the high
that's left in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said that CBN, when the cart is at
basically 50%, it's all gone?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the majority of the carts that we've
tested, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no consistency in the delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mind you, it's not only because of bad
product, it's also because as an industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just haven't done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of information on how
to better preserve these cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: these terpenes and these flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are able to provide a consistent
delivery throughout the entire experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of the cannabinoids that you've tested,
which one is sort of the most consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the life of a cart?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say THC and CBD are the most
consistent, but the answer is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: skewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big caveat here is that those are the
two primary cannabinoids that are the most
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think as the industry progresses and
as the research progresses, we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to find more cannabinoids that can
basically provide, I would say the same
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, but also be more consistent in
the delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so will that have to do with kind of
tweaking temperatures and different things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about the extraction
techniques, the ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we hear a lot about the
entourage effect, but what we don't hear a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot about is the entourage effect of
different cannabinoids with different
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes also modifies the physical
properties of the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can make it less viscous, more viscous,
and that has an influence on the vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that you mentioned in
your presentation too was adding
[SPEAKER_01]: additional terpenes too can affect,
I think you mentioned either was the pH or
[SPEAKER_01]: the viscosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't quite remember, but that is a
consideration as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH is basically the acidity of your
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the majority of distillates,
we're looking at a pH of four.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add a couple more terpenes in
there, which are more acidic, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to end up maybe at three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we get into those very acidic
products is when you start hearing about
[SPEAKER_00]: leaching and leaching is basically the
acidic nature of the concentrate that will
[SPEAKER_00]: be eating away at the hardware and
extracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you call it in science,
leachables and extractables.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically going to extract out of,
for instance, the center post.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is any kind of lead, it might
extract the lead out of that center post
[SPEAKER_00]: and that lead will end up in the oil,
thus in the aerosol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another reason why emissions testing,
it would be better than testing the oil
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, because emissions is what goes
into our lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from a testing lab perspective,
how much more onerous or difficult is it
[SPEAKER_01]: to be doing emission testing rather than
on oils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the oil testing has to be done
because the oil is probably used for other
[SPEAKER_00]: applications as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a given.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emissions testing, I think the biggest,
from a lab perspective, the biggest issue
[SPEAKER_00]: is investment in the proper tooling to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get vaping machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to trap the air or
solid comes out and then analyze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it's done, technically,
emissions testing should be, I would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: as cheap as regular oil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the methods, once you've extracted
the components of the aerosol,
[SPEAKER_00]: the methods are the same as with the oil
for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the methods are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material and the tooling is already
there to do those tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also mentioned that we're hoping
that federal legalization, it's on the
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, it's going to bring
FDA requirements and regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you anticipate those regs might
look like and how different would they be
[SPEAKER_01]: from what's required now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think whether it's the FDA or
anything or any other government body,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, when this goes federally legal,
there's going to have to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: safeguards in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we want to look at, for instance,
the nicotine vaping industry, emissions
[SPEAKER_00]: testing was mandatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is something called the PMTA
process, the pre-market authorization
[SPEAKER_00]: approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has three different parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has one part clinical trials,
one part emissions research, one part
[SPEAKER_00]: really literature research on all the
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavors that are included in
vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to take any lessons from that,
I strongly believe that when the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government steps in, those kind of testing
cycles are going to be required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bear in mind, the PMTA cycles are in
nine triplicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine $250 per triplicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to multiply that by nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to work out the
consistency of the product, because again,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a natural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from batch to batch, you're going to
have to be doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that when the federal government
steps in, if companies are not ready and
[SPEAKER_00]: have not future proofed their go-to-market
strategy and their testing strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be a wild surprise out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reprieve here is that it took them
four to five years for nicotine vaping to
[SPEAKER_00]: create all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be a moratorium for four to
five years, but it's still really a heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: workload.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really urge all processors to start
looking into this right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what those requirements
might be and starting to set up any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of testing or research that needs to be
done right now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with those requirements on consistency
and things like that, would that limit the
[SPEAKER_01]: type of products that would be available
for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I imagine like sort of like in the
cannabis space, whether it's live resin or
[SPEAKER_01]: live rosin, kind of these more whole plant
extracts would be hard to keep consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: from batch to batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be a burden on
the industry to prove to the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government that we may not have that batch
to batch consistency, but the methods of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction and the methods of production
are robust enough to ensure consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: safety throughout each batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started the conversation talking
about, you know, how many patients do we
[SPEAKER_01]: think are using vape?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of wanted to talk about,
you know, for folks maybe who are using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis medicine now and aren't using
vape, but maybe want to get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some tips or some best practices
for how they can do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the fundamental aspect
behind this is biopsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biophilability is how these cannabinoids
and how these consumption methods are
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting the user.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer is it's going to be
different with everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are ways to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how when we talk about edibles,
it states even on a lot of packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: please just have one, wait at least an
hour before having another one because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the onset time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the same thing with vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with vapes, I think one of the best
tips we can give is whether you're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: disposable or another battery is really
use the lowest setting possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lowest setting in terms of voltage
that's possible will allow to have better
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor because of the terpenes and the
flavonoids that have lower boiling points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have better flavor and you'll
ease into the high aspect of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you get used to that low
setting, then you can start increasing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and really understand how that
works for you as a patient because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different again from one patient
to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if there's one piece of advice,
that's the one I would give is really look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the lowest setting first to make sure
that you get the effects that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually looking for with these devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a whole bunch of other little
things I stated earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you have unique serial
numbers, make sure you have the COAs of
[SPEAKER_00]: the oil, make sure you're buying from a
reputable brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of brands now have the possibility
of entering a serial number to see if the
[SPEAKER_00]: product is a fake one or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are really the next best
steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing I would recommend is
asking the bud tenders in the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: if they can provide any kind of research
they have on that particular product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now is there any way to sort of figure
out how many milligrams you're getting per
[SPEAKER_01]: draw?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is absolutely no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always laugh when I hear people talking
about dosing and cannabis vaping devices
[SPEAKER_00]: because dosing depends on each and every
one of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on something as simple as the
length of a puff and all the way down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the viscosity, the porosity of the ceramic
or the other kind of wicking material
[SPEAKER_00]: that's used in the coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there really is no way to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can do is look at each device and
be able to predict how much, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the oil itself, be able to predict how
much is going to be available to the user.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that's not really dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say dosing is the cartridge
itself or the device itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this, there is one milligram of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the maximum amount you're going to
be having when you're done with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge, whether you finish it in 10
puffs or 10,000 puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the maximum amount you're going to
be getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more a factor of here's one
milligram of nicotine and understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: how long that lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, it's really trial and
error for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, starting with that lower
temperature is really going to help
[SPEAKER_00]: patients understand how this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other consideration too would be
how much oil is left in the cart,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were talking about with CBN,
if you're at half the cart, you might
[SPEAKER_01]: already be out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, only science,
research, and time will tell us how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a better grasp on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can say is that there are ways to
get consistent delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just came out with a device called the
Simple, and we're very pleased to see that
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout 90% of the device, we have
consistent delivery of all the major
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is also due to a new technology
and a new way of creating the device.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have never learned that if we
hadn't looked at how this worked in
[SPEAKER_00]: regular cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so winding down now, I want to give
you an opportunity to plug any other
[SPEAKER_01]: resources that you think would be helpful
for the listeners that they can learn
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, plug your company as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can you can definitely look for
the vape survey on our website,
[SPEAKER_00]: bling.com the blink group.com slash vape
survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a an initial user generated
topography data research on how users and
[SPEAKER_00]: we separated into in Canada and the US
we've interviewed 1000 users to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: how they vape and how they vape cannabis
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really to understand the
differences between the nicotine puffing
[SPEAKER_00]: regime cannabis puffing regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that if we used a joint or a
vape like we do a cigarette, we would
[SPEAKER_00]: basically be way too high because a
cigarette is roughly 12 puffs and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a few minutes to take them vaping or
is is a little bit more spread out because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can literally vape whenever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important to understand
those differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one great piece of research that
we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are slowly going to be publishing
throughout the next couple of months
[SPEAKER_00]: research on the consistency throughout the
device of delivery of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure to head to our Instagram and
LinkedIn pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The handle is the blink group blink with a
C to stay up to date on all the new
[SPEAKER_00]: research that we're going to be publishing
in the next few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll be sure to share that with the
listeners as well when that comes out.
