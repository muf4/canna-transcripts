[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, happy new year, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that your 2024 is off to a good
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have certainly been busy here at CanMed
putting together the program for CanMed24.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we are in the process of
notifying our oral presenters and
[SPEAKER_00]: confirming their participation in this
year's event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be coming out very soon within
the next few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one part of the CanMed24 event that
has already been announced is the capital
[SPEAKER_00]: markets workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the second year that we have
had the workshop after it received raved
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, Golden Eagle Partners will
lead this three-hour workshop,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will cover the hurdles, issues,
and concepts around funding cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis innovation from a global
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this episode is David
Traylor, who is the senior managing
[SPEAKER_00]: director at Golden Eagle Partners and
organizer of the capital markets workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: After advising on various transactions in
the life science sector, David took an
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in the cannabis sector and
started advising cannabis companies before
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually refounding Golden Eagle
Partners in 2014 to focus on advising
[SPEAKER_00]: companies across the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before Golden Eagle Partners, David served
at leading investment banking firms,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Pacific Growth Equities,
Keras & Company, and Headwaters MB.
[SPEAKER_00]: During his banking tenures, he has advised
private and public biotechnology and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical device companies in various
transactions, including IPOs, public
[SPEAKER_00]: offerings, private offerings, mergers and
acquisitions, totaling over $500 million
[SPEAKER_00]: in value.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss what
attendees can expect from the capital
[SPEAKER_00]: markets workshop, redefining cannabis
nomenclature, the likelihood the DEA will
[SPEAKER_00]: reschedule cannabis this year,
pharma's growing interest in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: derived compounds, and challenges cannabis
innovators face when raising capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my interview with David,
I want to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Eagle Partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Eagle Partners are transactional
experts specializing in mergers,
[SPEAKER_00]: acquisitions, reverse mergers,
financings, and incremental transactions
[SPEAKER_00]: such as licensing, joint ventures,
and co-development arrangements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have combined experience in the early
stages of cannabis and life science
[SPEAKER_00]: sectors, which allows them to confidently
close strategic and financing transactions
[SPEAKER_00]: that match the near and long-term goals of
their clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at goldeneaglepartners.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with David
[SPEAKER_00]: Traylor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we are far.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, you know, we got this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we are excited to have you on the
podcast and excited to have you and Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle Partners back for CanMed24 leading
the capital markets workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a half-day affair.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about everything involved in
investing in cannabinoid innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great response last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people got a lot of great value
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think everyone's really excited to
have you back again for CanMed24.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we kind of dive into what folks
can expect at the capital markets
[SPEAKER_00]: workshop, I want to give you the
opportunity to kind of talk a bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: your background and why you're excited to
join us at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the one thing to start off
with is, yeah, we've been, one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: things is we've just been lucky to be
where we're at because it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: predict where cannabis is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I can talk here in a sec about
how we consider cannabis and break that
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason why I say we're lucky
because, you know, last year we jumped
[SPEAKER_01]: into the, you know, organizing the capital
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Workshop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first time you guys had done
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought it was important to,
you know, to compete effectively with our
[SPEAKER_01]: other, you know, big larger investment
banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we thought that was an important event
to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my background just fits well into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two undergrad degrees in science,
got into biotech 15 years of operational
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in biotech companies,
and then jumped into investment banking in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did biotech deals in San Francisco,
Ben, and then came back to Colorado where
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was leading a life science group,
a group called Headwaters, and found
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden Eagle Partners in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when Colorado, Washington
legalized adult use, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at it and we consider
cannabis to be very similar to biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we jumped in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've done a number of deals,
27, 28 deals, I think in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had cannabis clients on six of the
seven continents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing it 10 years actually,
come last over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got into it December, 2013,
but we've also been doing it eight years
[SPEAKER_01]: come this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first Israeli client was January,
2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly we are the first investment
bank in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: to do cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we're lucky to be where we're
at because the industry is just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: moving towards kind of the science and the
biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we want to be a part of
CanMed last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, and you mentioned that sort of
cannabis seemed like a natural fit coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain a bit about what the similarities
are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, there's some similarities,
some not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this also gets to what we just
mentioned to you before you joined on
[SPEAKER_01]: this, Ben, that coming from having a
biochemistry background, one of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you learn when you're in chemistry
class that they've started, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the late 1800s to come up with a
consistent nomenclature with all these
[SPEAKER_01]: weird molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this gets also to the D.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: rescheduling issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we go there, I mean,
that's one thing we wanted to kind of make
[SPEAKER_01]: it more better, more consistent
nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we believe instead of saying
marijuana is cannabis or cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and, you know, cannabinoids,
cannabinoids, you know, potato,
[SPEAKER_01]: potato, it's been kind of a mess over the
last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe cannabis, you know,
it is a genus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we break it down pretty easily to
two sectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC plus, which is, you know, Delta 8,
Delta 9, Delta 10, THCA, THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the THC minus,
which is a lot of people call hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, which, you know, you have the
molecular side and then you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can have, you know,
the molecular side is flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can really kind of if you really
look at the cannabis plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids aren't just in cannabis and in
other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if you set the table that way,
it makes discussions much more simplistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, looking at the,
as I mentioned in the very beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: we saw this cannabis is very similar
biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you really break it down,
at least the way we saw it in 2012,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2013 is that, you know, cannabis was
highly regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a biological supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get down to it, you know,
it is a drug, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that in itself, I think is kind of the
most simple fact about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think getting into the other thing
that we see the importance of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, certainly CAMAD and biotech in
2024 is the fact that we think that what
[SPEAKER_01]: we have, Ben, is what we call the three
spokes, is you have all these amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we've mentioned, a lot of these
different molecules emanating from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of these indications or
diseases that need better treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have each individual has kind
of a different genetic makeup,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they metabolize things differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that itself, in the whole thing,
scheme of things is a big experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of experiments, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our whole goal is to help
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're investment bankers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So our goal is to help really good
companies that are trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions to provide data to solve that
big puzzle and find them very good
[SPEAKER_01]: capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of breaks it down what we do
and why we think cannabis and biotech are
[SPEAKER_01]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, and it's a great point that you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different compounds that
have potential for so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, you have the
whole idea of the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there is multiple different
compounds working to kind of service those
[SPEAKER_00]: targets too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a big project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to take a lot of smart
people, which is why we try to bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: together at CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we want to be involved,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, so let's talk a bit about the capital
markets workshop and kind of what you have
[SPEAKER_00]: planned there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can attendees expect from the
workshop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what we're trying to do is,
well, let's get back to the role of
[SPEAKER_01]: Genesis as I remember when I was talking
to Brendan and heard about CanMed for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time and thought, well, it'd be good
for it to be a part of that for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons that we just talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the previous incarnations,
CanMed was really all about science,
[SPEAKER_01]: which it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing is if you practice and
look in science and biotech, you realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that innovation is not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So capital is always a big part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since innovation is now becoming more
important, part of cannabis, that was
[SPEAKER_01]: finally included in the agenda last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were lucky enough to beat out Cowan and
Stiefel to be the main sponsor of the
[SPEAKER_01]: event last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like, last year we essentially
did the first event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cool thing about it was we pretty
much put the whole program together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had nine panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We essentially tried our best to put the
best and brightest, but also men,
[SPEAKER_01]: women, including more women.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're not frankly included
enough in a lot of these panels,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's science-based or not in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the original idea was to kind of
come together with a lot of the topics
[SPEAKER_01]: that are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, going back to biotech and
trying to kind of replicate and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, what are some of the issues that
have been important that I've known about
[SPEAKER_01]: since being a part of the biotech
community back in late 1980s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that includes IP, innovation,
development, kind of looking at the past
[SPEAKER_01]: where we've been, where we're gonna go,
talking about molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of the way we set the
table in this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing about CAM-Med is
that you guys have done such a nice job
[SPEAKER_01]: with the event that there's a lot of great
topics going on at different times or at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've cut down the workshop to six
presentations and they're a little shorter
[SPEAKER_01]: this year, but it's meant to allow people
to go across, fertilize a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're gonna do is we have six
topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna be a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're gonna still include like
last year and this year, we're gonna still
[SPEAKER_01]: have a topic on cultivation or production.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we call alternative production
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you're looking at phytosources or
non-phytosources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call it synergistic compounds
or synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nomenclature, but then also another one
that we talked about last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: another topic we had, which we're gonna
replicate this year is intellectual
[SPEAKER_01]: property.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna continue to be a big part of
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think, you know, and by the way,
for everybody listening, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the best part about CAM-Med is
the property that you guys put it on,
[SPEAKER_01]: Markle Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: The event is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beach is the widest, longest beach
we've ever seen or I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And white sand too.
[SPEAKER_01]: White sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys also provide enough time for
people to meet and greet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's, you know, to be frank,
you know, we're looking at, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're the lead sponsor last year of what
we believe the most important events in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis globally were.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was Benzinga, Miami.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another was ICBC and the GIF in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also CAM-Med.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we've certainly already
committed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to replicate the same thing with
Benzinga and ICBC, but we've certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: already signed up for CAM-Med just because
I think it's kind of a part of the future
[SPEAKER_01]: of where cannabis is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was last year was the first year that
we included sort of the investment angle,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're absolutely right that it's
essential because research is not cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for folks who are doing research into
cannabinoids, the sources of funding are
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat limited, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of it being because of the
scheduling of cannabis where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't get government grants or
anything to do research because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a nice little segue into one of
the topics that it's really at the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people's minds as we move into
2024 is this whole idea of the possibility
[SPEAKER_00]: of the DEA rescheduling cannabis from a
schedule one drug to a schedule three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to get your thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think that's going to happen,
when maybe you think that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen and what does that really mean for
investment in the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, first off to say,
I think most people agree out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no crystal ball for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a hard industry to predict.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that being said, I was looking through
some old emails over the holiday then and
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled up some material that we've been
asked to put together for an IC3 event,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is many people in the know or not in
the know, but they've been around the
[SPEAKER_01]: block in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in New York in October 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Al Foreman was part of this piece of
paper that was put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: A number of us were asked to kind of
provide our predictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Zuber, Bika Desai, a number of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that we came out
with looking at is trying to predict in
[SPEAKER_01]: five years what the sector is going to
look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the first things we started off
with was how many medical states are there
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be in five years?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did some simple math,
but we essentially said that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be 40 states in DC that are
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly speaking, if you look back at
it right now, and that was October 2018,
[SPEAKER_01]: five years ago, we didn't hit the nail on
the head, frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, there's no crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing that we like to do at
Golden Eagle Partners is we're very
[SPEAKER_01]: quantitative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I have a degree in biochemistry and
degree in molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, I have three US patents to my
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very analytical and quantitative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of you may have seen the piece
that we put out on LinkedIn mid-December
[SPEAKER_01]: on trying to actually apply some of the
data that the DEA, we looked at how many
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds had been scheduled, rescheduled,
or descheduled.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last five years, the answer was 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we looked at applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do those actually happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: What quarter of each calendar year from
2018 on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we applied that analysis to when
we might think what this might happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's hard to predict.
[SPEAKER_01]: But coming from our analysis, we thought
there's a 10% chance that it won't even be
[SPEAKER_01]: a schedule three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a schedule two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if it's a schedule three,
then when might that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I thought was there's probably a 25%
chance that if they rescheduled to
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule three, it might not even have
before the election.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is just kind of applying
some trying to sense to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everybody had agreed listening
to this that there's not 100% chance that
[SPEAKER_01]: the DEA is going to reschedule this before
the election.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that being said, out of the 75%
chance, we applied that to the data that
[SPEAKER_01]: we saw on when these events happen,
when the DEA announces these in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Federal Register.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our analysis came up with the best
chances in Q2 that it will be rescheduled,
[SPEAKER_01]: 41% chance it will happen in Q2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've also heard people thinking that
the DEA is going to announce a
[SPEAKER_01]: rescheduling of cannabis on April 20th,
420.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't imagine that the DEA is going
to play to the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, one of the points we
don't think they're going to play the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing that during the
Benzinga podcast with Hunter Land,
[SPEAKER_01]: our thought is it's probably not going to
happen before the election.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the data points that not many
people saw, I think it was December 12th,
[SPEAKER_01]: just less than a month ago, the DEA
announced adding another six compounds to
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are cannabis mimetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they're not naturally occurring
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not even cannabinoids,
they're cannabis mimetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do hit the CB1, CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it's out of the realm of
imagination to assume that the DEA was
[SPEAKER_01]: thumbing their nose at the cannabis sector
by throwing these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, again, to be clear,
Ben, the DEA put these six compounds on a
[SPEAKER_01]: temporary or preliminary schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a year, if their findings come
to fruition, they will then keep it on or
[SPEAKER_01]: take it off schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guess is, though, that most people
don't realize that there are 43 cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: or cannabis mimetic cannabinoid associated
compounds on schedule one right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now let's add to the 43 to the six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now there's 49.
[SPEAKER_01]: 43 was the number before December.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's 49.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that's so screwed up about
this whole thing that we want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: really important is that there's over 500
compounds that are scheduled by the DEA on
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule one through five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of those, there's only one of those is
not a compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is not a compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a genus, as we mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this whole thing about trying to apply
analysis and logic to what the DEA is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do this is really hard to do
because, again, the whole logic behind
[SPEAKER_01]: this, again, if you're applying the
biochemistry perspective on this,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is not a compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a collection of 500 plus compounds,
or more than that, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having them reschedule or
deschedule cannabis as itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, that was a long-winded explanation
to a... No, but it's interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you bring up a good point,
one I wasn't aware of about the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: mimetics that are on schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allow me to play the optimist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the DEA were to... You too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Q2, but no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the DEA were to reschedule cannabis
from schedule one to schedule three,
[SPEAKER_00]: but keep those mimetics on schedule one,
would that be potentially a positive for
[SPEAKER_00]: those of us who are rooting for the
cannabis-derived compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there'll be three, and the kind of
synthetic ones, I know you don't like that
[SPEAKER_00]: term, but those will be sort of more on
the schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and that's a nuanced question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the easy answer is absolutely with
280E.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the assumption, too, is if they
reschedule from one to three, that that
[SPEAKER_01]: requires that the IRS then get rid of
280E.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a matter of fact, a lot of people
don't understand where 280E came from,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't probably need to get into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a drug dealer that got busted
in the early 80s when Reagan was the
[SPEAKER_01]: president, and they just said no to drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the drug dealer got away with a bunch
of money because he was fast with his tax
[SPEAKER_01]: returns, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they wanted to stop that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think the easy answer is,
yeah, if you get rescheduled to three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if it goes to two, the way 280E set
up, it doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it does go to schedule three,
it should be a huge help for any
[SPEAKER_01]: plant-touching company that touches THC+,
as we call it, in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: because it should dramatically help their
margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with that, too, though,
Ben, is that a lot of these companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: we know since we've been in it so long
have rolled up some pretty significant tax
[SPEAKER_01]: liability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if 280E does get rolled back,
I can guarantee you, and I've had to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the IRS tax court on a thing before,
they're not gonna just immediately say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, they're gonna forgive all the back
taxes, they're gonna still require those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 280E is gonna be an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be frank, though, that's not a big
part of Canmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the 280E and a lot of these
companies, I mean, the one thing we wanna
[SPEAKER_01]: bring up, too, is the importance of
biotech in cannabis is incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: important because, especially going into
2024, because a lot of people don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: about Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Switzerland, we believe, is right now
at the forefront of adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just talking about adult use and
280E and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Switzerland is essentially,
has a program they rolled out just last
[SPEAKER_01]: year, just about a year ago this year,
that's essentially adult use, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very limited, but it's being tracked very
effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being followed by the International
Narcotics Control Board, which is part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Single Convention of 61.
[SPEAKER_01]: The FOPH, which is the Federal Office of
Public Health in Switzerland, is on board
[SPEAKER_01]: tracking this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they wanna do is have people use
this drug or cannabis, recreationally
[SPEAKER_01]: adult use, but then also track it over two
years to make sure that there's not any
[SPEAKER_01]: adverse effects or anything, which we know
there's really not going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that applied, like biotech,
really stringent following of the adult
[SPEAKER_01]: use market is gonna be one of the only
ways that we get adult use to break out of
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of mess of overregulation by the
IRS, overregulation by the UN,
[SPEAKER_01]: overregulation by the EU, overregulation
by almost every regulatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in Colorado, the MED still
overtaxes things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think science and biotech need to be
applied to not only adult use,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to the medical side to dispel a lot of
the stigma that still stands in the way of
[SPEAKER_01]: this amazing plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noah, and that's a great point kind of
talking about the distinction between
[SPEAKER_00]: medical and adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And folks I've talked to before about,
if and when ever we get federal
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, the thought is that it will
be medical first before it's adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you kind of see it happening the
same way, that that's sort of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the Matt Dougherty who works with
me at GP thinks that if the industry would
[SPEAKER_01]: have put more emphasis on the medical
side, then we would not be where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we're a global firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're trying to do is see how
regulators can open up things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like CBD in Australia has been
overregulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go into the full details,
but globally, we're seeing it kind of come
[SPEAKER_01]: out of its shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is too, and we mentioned
this when I was in Dover, Davos in 2020
[SPEAKER_01]: during the World Economic Forum before the
pandemic hit, is that there's three things
[SPEAKER_01]: we learned in North America that might
apply to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is that geographies almost
always roll out a lot slower than you
[SPEAKER_01]: expect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you look at Germany,
they were expecting a year ago that,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, we're really talking about adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it continued to get stalled and
stalled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they thought it might be really
going gangbusters by now here January
[SPEAKER_01]: 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just in December last year,
that got stalled off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we're talking about adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I think let's get back to the main
point about CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about applying technology and biotech
to this amazing plant, these compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: to find out which compounds do which
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can apply more really good data
behind all these different compounds that
[SPEAKER_01]: are coming out, then it will help us
dispel a lot of the stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is what we need to do to get the
regulators to stop over-regulating to
[SPEAKER_01]: people, have people, new adopters adopt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, there's a lot of
compounds that I haven't used yet that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that could be good for me,
but it's hard to know which compounds out
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis compounds or cannabinoids are
good for which things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know that, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and there's a lot of them in that I
know that we're going to have a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: talks this year that are talking about
flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not even cannabinoids or terpenes,
but flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number of different compounds that
are showing potential, it just seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and growing every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other thing to talk about 2024
in CanMed that will be interesting is that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to be golden eagle partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be at JPMorgan next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And JPMorgan has become the de facto
leading conference in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, last night I had a
late night call with the leading generic
[SPEAKER_01]: company out of India and their head of
global innovation is going to be in San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco and hopefully we'll have a call
or a meeting with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be an investment banker in
biotech in San Francisco, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was the biggest week of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about just biotech,
when we're talking Pfizer, we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: McKesson, we're talking large and small in
biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always been an interesting read
of how people see biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think for us, it's going to be
really interesting because we haven't been
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been to JPMorgan since I got
into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be interesting to see what the
scuttlebutt is because we do have meetings
[SPEAKER_01]: with some of the leading pharma companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two clients that are going to be
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One client is out of Australia that's
trying to complete a phase three clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trial CBD and another one's out of Canada
that's trying to start a phase one and do
[SPEAKER_01]: preclinical with treating PTSD with
psilocybin and eugenol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is also, and we've been in
psychedelics for three years too,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't cover all this in 30 minutes,
but again, the psychedelic sector is the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's same and not.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of differences between the
sectors, but the whole idea of trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply data and really good high fidelity
data to psychedelics to find out which
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds can do which things for which
people is the same issue that we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: overcome, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you mentioned pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a growing interest in cannabis
from the pharma folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you know, one thing that
people don't appreciate is the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: Pfizer and Abbott Labs did quite a bit of
work back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even think Roche did too in the
eighties, seventies and eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know these pharma companies are
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the biggest questions with
pharma has been the fact that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds don't have composition of
matter coverage, which is usually a de
[SPEAKER_01]: facto requirement by pharma to do that,
to find, you know, they need that to
[SPEAKER_01]: support the drug development of a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So composition of matter coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have patents, you know,
mainly you can break it down to a method
[SPEAKER_01]: of use or a composition of matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so method of use is like a molecule
and say, okay, well, I'll use this
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule for asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that coverage can be tough because,
you know, kind of going after and
[SPEAKER_01]: litigating somebody on how they use it is
tougher than saying, okay, we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule, we have composition of matter
coverage, which means the makeup of this
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule is covered under patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a much more clear, much more
tougher thing to get around all those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have been able to get around
stuff like that in the past, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's anybody's guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's why we're going to JP
Morgan, Ben, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to predict.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we talked to one of the leading
large pharma VC firms earlier this year,
[SPEAKER_01]: less than six months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've known her for 20 years before I
got into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked her, you know, or them,
you know, what they, about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they essentially said, still no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, well, we don't have a
stated interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and that's, I'm sure that's
not just that company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of these companies that they,
a lot of these pharma companies are always
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they always need to look at new areas
to attack and to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't like to hear that
come from cannabis, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people from cannabis are, you know,
are purists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you mentioned, you have the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have the big, the big cannabis
play too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we're still trying to do
though, is help the small companies and
[SPEAKER_01]: the private companies come up with the
appropriate data or the business plan,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, like for us, you know,
we're not built on data, Golden Eagle
[SPEAKER_01]: Partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to build a firm too, that can't be
run over by a Goldman Sachs or Merrill
[SPEAKER_01]: Lynch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think we've maybe been able to achieve
that with the relationships we have
[SPEAKER_01]: globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the expertise we have going back to
the eighties, but that's no guarantee that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to get run over by Goldman
when things maybe roll back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the same thing with any small
company and cannabis doing science or
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise adult use or medical,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess kind of to tie it back all
back to the, the workshop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that really sort of who you're
tailoring this, this content for is sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, the small company who is,
is starting up and is looking into some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these novel compounds and they're looking
for funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can come to the workshop and kind of
learn some best practices to the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to get some funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually it's meant to go across the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's meant to reach out to biotech
companies and meant to reach out to pharma
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It meant to reach out to small companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It meant to reach out to P and G,
you know, companies that are not biotech
[SPEAKER_01]: or pharma oriented.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out on the outside looking in,
because what we've all been about G,
[SPEAKER_01]: P Golden Eagle Partners has always been
about Ben is, is help Brian providing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, trying to find the best capital
for the best companies, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: inside or outside of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also means to be the purveyor of
objective information to a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that are on the outside looking
in that don't understand the sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, we understand it better than
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly speaking, whether it's the big
company or small company and they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into cannabis, the smartest thing that
they could do is come to Golden Eagle
[SPEAKER_01]: Partners and say, what should we do
instead of trying to go in there and throw
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of money out and lose it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can guarantee you one thing
that's for sure in cannabis, there's been
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of money lost by people that have
been too arrogant and with too little
[SPEAKER_01]: arrogance and too much arrogance and too
little humility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if companies want to understand the
cannabis sector better, especially where
[SPEAKER_01]: the science is going, then yeah,
they would be prudent to show up at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Caval Markets Workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's a good place to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I let you go, David,
I want to give you a chance to plug any
[SPEAKER_00]: resources or websites or anything that you
think might be relevant to the folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: are listening and want to learn more about
what it is you do or want to learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: about what they can expect from the
Capital Markets Workshop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think if they want to learn more
about the Capital Markets Workshop,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can certainly go to the CanMed 2024
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can come to www.GoldenEaglePartners
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can certainly look me up on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: David Traylor, you can look me up on a
number of different platforms,
[SPEAKER_01]: but LinkedIn is mainly what we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were always interested in taking the
time to connect with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we mentioned, we had a good
conversation last night to a global
[SPEAKER_01]: generics company that is looking for ways
to get smarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to put links to that LinkedIn
post that you had talked about talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about rescheduling and the podcast that
you mentioned you did with Hunterland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to put that in the show
description so people can find that and
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your time, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And can't wait to see you down in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it's a few months out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too bad it's not next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be here before we know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would rate, review and subscribe to
the podcast on whichever platform you use
[SPEAKER_00]: to consume us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, stay safe, stay healthy,
and be sure to join us for the next Candid
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee Talk.
