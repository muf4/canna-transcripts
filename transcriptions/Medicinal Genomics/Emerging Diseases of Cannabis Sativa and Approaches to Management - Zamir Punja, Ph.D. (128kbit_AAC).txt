[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just like to start by thanking the
organizers for this opportunity to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research that I'll talk about has been
jointly funded by a company in British
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia, AgriMa Botanicals, as well as
the Natural Sciences and Engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: Research Council of Canada, which is
NSERC, a federal granting body,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as SFU, Simon Fraser University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you that need to contact me after
the talk or through email, punja at sfu
[SPEAKER_00]: .ca.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd like to do is talk about some
diseases of cannabis, diseases that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been previously unreported, and review
some of the moles that can get onto
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis product and assess some potential
disease control methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any licensed producer, any grower is going
to experience some form of disease or
[SPEAKER_00]: mold, and it's important that we
understand what they are and what we could
[SPEAKER_00]: do to manage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work was done in Canada, but all of
the results, I think, are applicable to
[SPEAKER_00]: any state or region that grows cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what am I going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with the root rot and crown rot
diseases, those of you that are familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with these Latin names, Fusarium and
Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll move on and talk about
botrytis, which is a major disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as a penicillium disease,
and then a few of the moles that can get
[SPEAKER_00]: onto cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I'm going to end with a
discussion on powdery mildew, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: major disease around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We conducted sampling in indoor and
greenhouse facilities, very limited field
[SPEAKER_00]: production of cannabis in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my work is limited to greenhouse
and indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Canada, probably the most largely
expanded industry in cannabis is in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got growers that previously grew
tomato, peppers, cucumbers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: switching over to cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the highly intensive
production system here in this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also indoor production,
mostly hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an old production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Few years back, where individual plants
are in these buckets provided with
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they use rock wall blocks,
which are on raised benches and also
[SPEAKER_00]: provided by hydroponic nutrient solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we first started this work,
we started looking at root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you see on your left is a disease
or a root rot that causes the browning of
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we isolated from that,
on your top right is this pretty pink
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus, which is Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the bottom is Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the Fusarium species that we
isolated from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We conducted pathogenicity studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is that we made sure
that the organisms we isolated are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on your left is the disease or the
symptomology caused by Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right is the inoculation with
Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see stunting and reduced root
growth as a result of these organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, unless you had a
comparison, you wouldn't actually know
[SPEAKER_00]: that these plants were diseased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it quite difficult for
diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here again is results from inoculation
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: On your left are plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: On your extreme left is a plant that was
not inoculated with Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right is a plant with Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the stunting, the yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on your right is the internal
discoloration of the Pyth that's due to
[SPEAKER_00]: infection by Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a wilt Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a root in a crown rot Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, we see the discoloration only in
the Pyth and not in the vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, you encounter Fusarium and
Pythium together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, you can see that the
results are lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants collapse, whether they're in
the greenhouse or under field conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photograph on the right was taken in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants completely collapse within
two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under extreme heat, the roots are
completely gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the concerns with Fusarium,
of course, is that the inoculum of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spores can spread from infected areas up
onto the foliage or onto the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, the inoculum can
move sideways onto other adjacent plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly if you're growing in a
hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy for spores to move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we saw that when we looked at
propagation systems where these cuttings,
[SPEAKER_00]: that were being rooted, were actually
damped off by infection by Fusarium that
[SPEAKER_00]: had moved through the hydroponic nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on your right, you see colonies of
Fusarium that came out from the hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these organisms are moving through the
systems in greenhouses or indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also seen cases where propagated
rooted cuttings that are being sold on the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace actually contain Fusarium
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't know this from the dark green
leaves, but you see the stunted growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cases yellowing, and in extreme
cases, the plants actually are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing a lot of movement of
these types of plant materials from one
[SPEAKER_00]: area to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to cause some major
problems with Fusarium in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we wanted to look at was
the growing substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the hydroponic growers use cocoa
fiber or coconut husk derived substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to see whether or not these
substrates contain organisms or
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms that potentially had the
ability to spread, potentially spread
[SPEAKER_00]: either into the air or onto the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were actually surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cocoa product that hasn't been
autoclaved or sterilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of organisms in there,
particularly organisms such as
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus, Aspergillus niger,
various types of penicillium species,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other types of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came as a bit of a surprise to us
that hydroponically manipulated substrates
[SPEAKER_00]: such as this can actually have microbes in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you familiar with moles,
you know this is Aspergillus niger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Aspergillus terius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is material that comes
from overseas that probably hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilized and actually contains a fair
amount of these pretty awful organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: that have the potential to spread through
the plant or onto the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So airborne contamination can be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spores that are in the air may land on the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may land on the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, colonize those particular
tissues and potentially result in
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we devised a system
where we could sample air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very simple, straightforward
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a Petri dish with agar,
put it out in the greenhouse or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing environment, leave it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: for 60 minutes and bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see in this particular slide
are colonies of cladosporium, colonies of
[SPEAKER_00]: penicillium that are in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can monitor and quantify the
numbers of these microbes in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see here, this is weeks of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the blue bars, cladosporium levels
start to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plant grows, we see penicillium
levels start to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is saying to us is that as
you accumulate plant materials and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, these molds start to propagate and
increase in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fairly horrific in the sense
when you look at this, you realize it's
[SPEAKER_00]: completely covered in mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a plate that was exposed to the
trim room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trim room is where mechanized
pruning or cutting of buds occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing is a release of
spores from the plant material getting up
[SPEAKER_00]: into the air and then landing back down on
the Petri dishes or potentially on
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are organisms such as
aspergillus here, as well as various
[SPEAKER_00]: penicilliums and cladosporium species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that needs to be
looked at, I think, in the future where
[SPEAKER_00]: confined spaces that are being used to
trim product can actually accumulate very
[SPEAKER_00]: high levels of mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some scanning electron
microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see here are the stigmatic
hairs that are found on buds of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice the spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are spores of penicillium that are
actually stuck to the surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stigmatic hairs, which is one way for the
spores that get into the air to land back
[SPEAKER_00]: on plants and start to colonize those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a close up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an awesome photograph because
it actually shows you these penicillium
[SPEAKER_00]: spores stuck to the stigmatic hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are about three microns in diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is that this
magnification that you're seeing here is
[SPEAKER_00]: about 100,000 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they look large, but they're actually
tiny spores that get onto product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found is there actually is
a penicillium bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the penicillium spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they are again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually were able to identify
penicillium species on Petri dishes that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from these various production sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: These penicillium species are diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these actually have been reported
by medicinal genomics two years ago in a
[SPEAKER_00]: study that they conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the first to actually report
penicillium species on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing a diversity of species,
penicillium citronum here and various
[SPEAKER_00]: other species on product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these are mycotoxin producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botrytis bud rot is another disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say too much about this,
but it's certainly, as seen here,
[SPEAKER_00]: a devastating disease that gets on certain
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can cause a high degree of
devastation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to finish my talk just to spend
a few minutes and talk about powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a major, major disease on cannabis
caused by this fungus, Golovinomyces
[SPEAKER_00]: chikoresiarum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as most of you know, those of you that
grow cannabis will know, it causes a white
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery appearance on the leaves,
on the buds, on flowers, and it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: product unsalable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at this organism again in the
scanning electron micrograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate to use the word pretty and
amazing for mold, but this is really quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a stunning photograph that shows you the
mildew spores actually being produced on
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface of the leaf, a cannabis leaf,
which causes the white appearance that we
[SPEAKER_00]: attribute to mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, in some cases, this mildew
has a real preference for trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see here is the mycelium
actually coiling itself around a trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: on a cannabis bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it is again, because cannabis
trichomes are sticky, they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: attract spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're actually seeing spores stuck
to cannabis flowers because of the resin
[SPEAKER_00]: that is extruded that causes these spores
to stick to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what are we going to do about
powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our objective here was to screen six
biocontrol of reduced risk chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up looking at these products
shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regalia Max, Rhapsody, which is a
bacterial product, Mil-Stop, potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: bicarbonate, Xeritol, which is hydrogen
peroxide, Actinovate, and Neem Oil as six
[SPEAKER_00]: of these treatments to see what effect
they would have on powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've set up a very good system for
reproducing powdery mildew disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a strain called Copenhagen-Kusch,
which is highly, highly sensitive to
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were grown in these humid chambers
for two weeks and allowed to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we assessed disease development,
and then we started the applications of
[SPEAKER_00]: the products that I mentioned to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sprayed on a weekly basis for
four weeks, and then we assessed disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what you see with some of the more
effective products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew disease spreads rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see here, within four weeks or five
weeks, it's reached as high as 40% to 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Various products had different levels of
control with products here that are
[SPEAKER_00]: Regalia and Rhapsody, providing pretty
good control of this particular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a representative illustration of
the effectiveness of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control, Actinovate, Rhapsody,
Xeritol, Mil-Stop, and Regalia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, none of these obviously are
completely effective against disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: but remember, this is a highly susceptible
variety or strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in combination with genetic
resistance, I think some of these products
[SPEAKER_00]: might be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that this slide
illustrates is that we're ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic screening of cannabis cultivars or
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a method now that will allow us to
look at whether there are any forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance present in cannabis using this
sort of a system, because it's sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that we can see differences that
may be attributable to genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to summarize, these results,
the two products that are registered in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, Mil-Stop and Xeritol, are
reasonably effective in controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regalia, which is registered in various
states in the US, is not registered in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, but it is a very good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem and Rhapsody were not the greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not registered at this point in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Actinovate, interestingly enough,
which was not a great product in these
[SPEAKER_00]: studies, has now been deregistered in
Canada for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what I've tried to do here is
illustrate some of the important diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: that are affecting cannabis productions in
Canada and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to show you some of the ways in
which these diseases spread, the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of mold in the environment that
could potentially land on product,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's in the greenhouse,
in an indoor facility, or in a trim room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried to show you that some of
the major molds are things like
[SPEAKER_00]: penicillium and cladosporium that can
cause issues later on in packaged product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've looked at some ways to manage
these various diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've illustrated some of the products that
we've assessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are others that we'll be interested
in looking at to see whether or not things
[SPEAKER_00]: like powdery mildew and Fusarium and
Pythium root rot can actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the need for research on this
topic is obviously critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're happy to collaborate with people on
looking at various types of disease
[SPEAKER_00]: control methods, and I think particularly
for screening for genetic resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking at a molecular method
to see if we can identify some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a straightforward PCR,
and it shows you the various disease
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms that are identified with this
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium, Pythium, Botrytis, the four
species of penicillium that I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternaria, which is a disease that's just
starting to come on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't seen very much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is plant DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one right here, this very unique
banding pattern is powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see powdery mildew very
consistently using this PCR test,
[SPEAKER_00]: which uses the ITS region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think early detection of disease is
very, very important because growers can
[SPEAKER_00]: then manage the possible outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada is now one week into legalized
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this research, again, was funded by
AgriMo Botanicals and NSERC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank Darren and Cameron for the
help in this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
We
[SPEAKER_01]: have time for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great lecture and incredible images.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that one of the species of
bud rot can be mycotoxin producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news about powdery mildew is it's
not a mycotoxin producing organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the penicilliums are probably the most
notorious aspergillus, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: alternaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one report of cladosporium
producing a mycotoxin, but the big ones
[SPEAKER_00]: are the penicillium and the aspergillus,
the ones that are in the air that could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially land on product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
