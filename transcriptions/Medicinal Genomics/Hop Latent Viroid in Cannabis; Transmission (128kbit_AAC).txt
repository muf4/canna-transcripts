[SPEAKER_01]: I'm testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's coming back negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm finding, oh no, a few plants
over in this corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I do more testing to make sure to
kind of mitigate this spread somehow or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if it's surely, if it's a definite
positive, I would move it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would move it into another room and then
decide what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's interesting because I haven't
seen any data yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen any data yet to suggest
that the viroid moves very effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road, for example, if somebody's
walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say if your clothes brush up against
the plant, I don't know that that is
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient damage to the leaf to move
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does for many viruses and viroids,
but there may be data out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I haven't seen it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I say that is because I've
walked into facilities where they've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: few infected plants here, there,
and everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this thing was moving with people
brushing up against the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: every damn plant in that location would be
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finding isolated spots here,
there, and everywhere that may have been
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced through a pruning tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: SAP, the movement of SAP is super
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you brush up against a plant,
there really is no SAP being released or
[SPEAKER_00]: on your clothes that's going to react on a
wound on another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But SAP on your tools and SAP on your
gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got obvious SAP stuck to your
gloves and you touch another plant and you
[SPEAKER_00]: damage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will transmit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damage is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tissue has to be damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, I think that the vascular system
has to be exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, there has to be a broken
vein or a broken off leaf that allows that
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid to enter in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just putting the viroid on the
surface of a leaf and letting it sit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe is going to cause it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to have the wounding and
you've got to have the SAP and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants could have picked it up if
there was recirculating water that has the
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid in it and somehow got into root
contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the viroids spread
within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recirculating water is a problem
because I haven't seen any treatments yet
[SPEAKER_00]: that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even 100 degrees centigrade heating
doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: UV doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorination doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know yet what treatments could be
made to water to clean it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: recirculating water yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's obviously a lot of
companies working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, we'll have an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, you have to be super
careful with water that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: recirculated from an infected mother or
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that seems like a massive issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in terms of that, so in addition to
testing plants, you should be testing your
[SPEAKER_01]: water and your surfaces, your equipment,
things like that as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so definitely if you're
recirculating and you know you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: high incidence of hot blatant,
you're almost guaranteed to have it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: recirculating water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've got to remember it's not pure
water that has the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's little flakes of small pieces of
roots and organic matter and debris that's
[SPEAKER_00]: come off the roots, that's sloughed off,
that's carrying the viroid in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whereas we circulated, it's still
got a little bit of particles and stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: it that potentially has the viroid in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen it on surfaces, for example,
on flood tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a plant that's sitting on a
table and there's water up against the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots on the bottom, you can find hot
blatant on the surface of that table as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as, of course, on tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, cleaning bleach does a pretty
good job or work on 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that comes in direct contact with
the water or the film of water that's on
[SPEAKER_00]: the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can eliminate hot blatant viroid quite
effectively on tools and on the surfaces
[SPEAKER_00]: of tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of what does it do to sap,
if there's infected sap, I don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: effective vercon or bleach are at this
stage, where you've got visible sap being
[SPEAKER_00]: moved from plant to plant, whether those
two chemicals will completely eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for surfaces, there's definitely
materials out there that will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank
you.
Thank you.
