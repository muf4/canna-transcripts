[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of clinical information
going on in California as you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has been legal as a medical
substance for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been seeing patients for the past 12
years and Over the past five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the incidence of cannabis use
in the elderly has totally skyrocketed
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started it was maybe 10% of my
population and now it's more like 50% in
[SPEAKER_00]: the age of 60 and above all the way to my
oldest patient is a hundred and four years
[SPEAKER_00]: old so Okay, I want to start by I don't
have a video but I do have a little story
[SPEAKER_00]: this is patient Stewart who's 86 years old
and He wrote a little op-ed for a local
[SPEAKER_00]: newspaper in Santa Cruz, California where
he said For some years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dealing with progressive
numbness and fierce pain in my feet a
[SPEAKER_00]: consequence of peripheral neuropathy that
began when I had diabetes I had trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: sleeping more than a few hours at night an
Old friend suggested that I try some
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana that he and his wife
were using for sleep with excellent
[SPEAKER_00]: results He gave me a small bottle of the
drops You will hear about the drops and
[SPEAKER_00]: the result result was also dramatic and
immediate Since the first night I tried
[SPEAKER_00]: the drops the swelling in my ankles and
the peripheral neuropathy pain in my feet
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared And for the first time in many
years, I sleep well every night and for as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as I wish This development truly
stunned me to neurologist and my competent
[SPEAKER_00]: caring regular doctor had told me that the
neuropathy was progressive incurable and
[SPEAKER_00]: untreatable I Have no pain anywhere I'm
sleeping better and longer than I have in
[SPEAKER_00]: years and feel a marvelous general sense
of well-being and energy without the
[SPEAKER_00]: lingering consciousness of stress all
without having to make any Thing to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: anything or waste a lot of time giggling
So I'm still seeing Stuart this is about
[SPEAKER_00]: four years later and his peripheral
neuropathy has progressed and He has
[SPEAKER_00]: started to use a different product for
sleep Which is has a lot more THC in it
[SPEAKER_00]: and he is still sleeping well and through
the night and the limitation on How his
[SPEAKER_00]: peripheral neuropathy has progressed has
to do with building a tolerance to the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: and being unable to financially afford the
kind of dosing that he needs to get to So
[SPEAKER_00]: he hasn't been able to really follow my
instructions as far as how much he needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to take for example a 15 milligram dose of
CBD three times a day would probably keep
[SPEAKER_00]: his neuropathy in check and he's only able
to afford 10 milligrams once a day and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is In case I forget to say it later
is the most limiting and the most
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrating factor of working with the
elderly because many are on fixed fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: incomes and they simply Don't feel that
they can afford the medicine some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: truly can't afford it and some of them are
Like you're asking me to spend $200 a
[SPEAKER_00]: month on medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just too big a piece of my pocket
and I can't do it Okay, I'm not gonna read
[SPEAKER_00]: this one you you'll have copies of all
this this is a half hour talk Then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in 20 minutes, but we see here
some very infamous drops which are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be in a study that I'm gonna be talking
about This is Bobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can dance again and you see her
arthritic hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're holding the drops Okay,
so to begin with we do have an informed
[SPEAKER_00]: consent sheet on my patient intake
questionnaire and one of the things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had on there were the risks of THC
cannabis which for years Like for 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: that was what was on the risk list and I'd
have all these older folks come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd start to receive Read about this
informed consent and risk list and they
[SPEAKER_00]: say well, I don't want to come in and do
this This is like I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get dizzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have memory loss So I had
to create an additional section on the
[SPEAKER_00]: risks for CBD use which most of them were
gonna be using and as you can see I never
[SPEAKER_00]: saw a risk for CBD use anywhere I made
this up and I can only come up with four
[SPEAKER_00]: items and You know the change in mood or
sensation is usually a positive thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a good one though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many patients do not sleep well on CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for another talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to consider and dry
mouth and loose stools so That's what they
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about before they come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't have time to go Through all of
these but we see that both THC and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next slide CBD have many available
Therapeutic uses and the important ones I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to point out here with the THC is
that it's analgesic and anti nociceptive
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't necessarily see that as a primary
component of CBD use people may disagree
[SPEAKER_00]: with me I get people that call me all the
time saying I want the pain medicine that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't get you high I want The CBD and if
it's inflammatory pain then indeed CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: helps But if you're working with the
central nervous system, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to get off opiates I have found
that CBD does not help nearly as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: THC So there are uses for THC that are
important even in the elderly and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: show you how we bring it in without
causing psychoactive effects and Then of
[SPEAKER_00]: course the main things with CBD are that
they're anti anxiety Anti psychotic is the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important effect that I think is
important because you can use it in
[SPEAKER_00]: combination with THC To actually get some
benefits of having THC in your system
[SPEAKER_00]: while not getting You know disoriented
really important effect of CBD among many
[SPEAKER_00]: others Okay, so what we do when we
consider using medicine in the elderly at
[SPEAKER_00]: least is to start with the concept of you
can use a CBD rich Medicine you won't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to worry about losing your balance about
being altered in your sensation and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the elderly really like that they will
eventually Go to a more THC rich medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: for sleep, but they like coming in with
this idea that they're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned and Just some information about
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have this wide range of effects,
which I showed in the last slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's important to remember that As in
all cannabinoids it does have a dose
[SPEAKER_00]: response curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's biphasic So dosing is very
important in both CBD and THC and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with your patients on follow-up
visits for dosing or it falls apart this
[SPEAKER_00]: is true of all age people and so in
California The model is is that you see
[SPEAKER_00]: patients once a year you give them an
approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go away You don't see them for a year
but if you really want to work with dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to see them like At least again
after one to three months to help adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: to that naive user To the to the user that
has developed a tolerance and you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the dosing and you have to deal
with tolerance Okay, there are some risks
[SPEAKER_00]: of using cannabis in the elderly This is
from the one article that I could find in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Journal of American Geriatrics that
spoke about Use of cannabis in the elderly
[SPEAKER_00]: there are no articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's none Nothing written Really that I
can find that has to do with any studies
[SPEAKER_00]: done of people using cannabis in the
elderly as far as you know a Published
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of anecdotal evidence So
what they say in this article is that
[SPEAKER_00]: older adults are vulnerable because of
age-related physiologic changes
[SPEAKER_00]: comorbidity polypharmacy Which increase
the likelihood of adverse drug effects
[SPEAKER_00]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's interesting because we're
gonna see that when we use cannabis we can
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease the polypharmacy and we're going
to decrease the Likely advent of drug
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an important reason why you do
want to use cannabis in the elderly is to
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease their pharmaceutical usage and of
course lack of information about safety
[SPEAKER_00]: and efficacy and this is really true,
but you have to keep in mind that most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the opinions that come out about Cannabis
and its use in any patient population is
[SPEAKER_00]: based on age-old ideas that have to do
with THC rich cannabis Which does have its
[SPEAKER_00]: value, but that's not what we're primarily
using in the elderly population Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was this having said there was no
studies, sorry there was one study done in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel about the use of cannabis in a
nursing home and most of the residents
[SPEAKER_00]: there did document dramatic physical
results weight gain reduction of pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: tremors and Help in mood and communication
skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done at the hotter in nursing
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of our Israeli members here will
remember this and what I want to point out
[SPEAKER_00]: about this study is that It was done with
the raw bud marijuana So it was either
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked or vaporized and that's all that
was available at the time of this study We
[SPEAKER_00]: are very fortunate in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about every single state but
in California We have almost all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different forms of cannabis available The
one that I find most useful for the
[SPEAKER_00]: elderly are tinctures those and I'll come
to that but generally alcohol extracted
[SPEAKER_00]: full plant extract in a dropper bottle
because we can regulate the dose by the
[SPEAKER_00]: drop and it gives us a Concentration range
that's useful for the elderly Anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: from maybe two or five milligrams of
cannabinoids to ten to twenty milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's appropriate for an alcohol tincture
Okay, so Because there wasn't any
[SPEAKER_00]: information out and I have so many elderly
patients and fortunately Many of them
[SPEAKER_00]: resided in an assisted living community It
was easy to gather just some data get a
[SPEAKER_00]: questionnaire and this is by no means a
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a survey But we did take a survey of
some of the patients in a senior community
[SPEAKER_00]: in my area To reiterate what was said by
the last speaker There's a problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: skilled nursing facilities anywhere where
nurses have to write an order We can't
[SPEAKER_00]: write orders for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This affects not only pediatric patients
in patients, but elderly patients in a
[SPEAKER_00]: skilled nursing facility So there is a
problem in getting the elderly To be using
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these cannabis products this
particular community had assisted living
[SPEAKER_00]: where they could choose to use what they
want and administer to themselves but when
[SPEAKER_00]: and if ever they had a condition that
required a Progress to the skilled nursing
[SPEAKER_00]: facility component.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not even hospitalization to
skilled nursing They had to come off of
[SPEAKER_00]: their cannabis and all of the polypharmacy
reduction that we had gained went out the
[SPEAKER_00]: window they were back up on their three or
four more drugs and At the time that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: this study about three years ago There was
not any way around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't the primary physician at this
skilled nursing facility I would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to write an order, but I couldn't
because I didn't have privileges there The
[SPEAKER_00]: primary physician wasn't willing to write
an order risk is DEA license So I'm happy
[SPEAKER_00]: to say that there are now one or two
physicians in the area that I was Worked
[SPEAKER_00]: that do come on staff at some of these
facilities that are willing to write
[SPEAKER_00]: orders and They say patient may continue
cannabis therapy That's what they say
[SPEAKER_00]: patient may continue cannabis therapy and
That's enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hospital, but it's enough that
the nurses will allow the patient to Come
[SPEAKER_00]: in with their note from me Which I say
this is what I recommend the patient use
[SPEAKER_00]: so between those two pieces of paper then
they're getting their medicine so that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how we've done it and I really
think that Nobody's trying to shut any
[SPEAKER_00]: place down for a few older patients
continuing to use their herbal medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: and So the the nursing home was happy with
it and the patients happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we've gotten around it Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'm gonna talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Okay, so Moving on is going into
the study the survey I should say so the
[SPEAKER_00]: participants in this survey all live in a
retirement community in, California I
[SPEAKER_00]: already talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important all had out access to
advice from a team of professionals So the
[SPEAKER_00]: the primary physician on call at this
assisted living facility Center was on
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually referred patients to me the
resident nurse manager became very
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in cannabis and was a
facilitator so that these old folks
[SPEAKER_00]: actually had someone to speak to on a
daily basis if they needed to help them
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of navigate their way through using
cannabis for the first time and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: had access to a cannabis specialist myself
and There is Karen the nurse manager
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensing the drops We'll come to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So The medicine was administered by the
patients themselves She might have taught
[SPEAKER_00]: them how to do it at the beginning,
but they took it themselves This was a
[SPEAKER_00]: survey the people in the survey one to
seven months at the time of the report
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd been using cannabis almost all the
patients were naive before they started At
[SPEAKER_00]: this time in this part of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no dispensary allowed There was
no dispensary, you know that the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: could go to so we have delivery services
and there were two or three delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: services in
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the questionnaire you can read
about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the results in here So the
kind of medicinal cannabis that the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients chose to use Because we did this
as a retrospective survey, so we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: tell them what to use topical tingling No
one chose to inhale At this time we had
[SPEAKER_00]: some problem with finding out what was in
the medicine they use because not all the
[SPEAKER_00]: materials were required to be lab tested
therefore not all were but many of them
[SPEAKER_00]: were you'll see and Not all the products
delivered to the elderly come from a
[SPEAKER_00]: reputable delivery service nor do they
come from a reputable dispensary that will
[SPEAKER_00]: even honor if you're lucky enough to have
A consultant tell you what they want you
[SPEAKER_00]: to take they'll go to a dispensary They'll
be out of the product that you want them
[SPEAKER_00]: to take and they'll give them something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big risk I can't tell you how many
times I've had patients call me and say I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't make it home They gave me the
wrong medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it before I left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to pull off the road and call 9-1-1
At least three times so We don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: control of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really big problem We don't have
any control of what the patients take all
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do is advise them Okay,
so this is just a review of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: used There are two different tinctures one
that's important is the glycerin tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can see it had a concentration of
about three to four milligrams of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids per milliliter the alcohol
tincture more Commonly has anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_00]: range of ten to thirteen milligrams per
milliliter the patient Ended up self
[SPEAKER_00]: titrating how much they used which will be
in the next slide They use more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: glycerin tincture less of the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea about self titration and
dosage really turns out to be true Other
[SPEAKER_00]: products that they used were the cookies
or the chocolates these were taken before
[SPEAKER_00]: bed at the suggestion of the Delivery
driver who said well if you want something
[SPEAKER_00]: for sleep use this this mostly had THC it
came as a shock many of them were not
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared but since It worked they
continued to use it We also had topicals
[SPEAKER_00]: and we had a couple of folks using flowers
boiled in tea and it really helped their
[SPEAKER_00]: pain So presumably they're getting THC a
out of their flowers boiled in tea Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: then This is just a review of the
patient's ages here in the left-hand
[SPEAKER_00]: column 78 to 97 What their dose range
ended up to be from their various
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines and we can See that we have
something from about a half a milligram up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 42 milligrams That's the range that the
patients self titrated into mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing around 10 to 15 milligrams and We
can conclude is that the patients do self
[SPEAKER_00]: titrate to an approximate Approximately,
you know around the 10 to 20 milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: dose range some more some less and the
Problem with topicals is that they're used
[SPEAKER_00]: to a medicine that this was not Given with
direction like yeah, it lasts four to five
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to use it three times a day So
they only used it once a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really need direction on every
single thing Okay, the last of this study
[SPEAKER_00]: is the different diagnoses that the
patients were seen for mostly centering on
[SPEAKER_00]: peripheral neuropathy arthritis and
insomnia and you'll see on the Right hand
[SPEAKER_00]: slide is the change in medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at that later in almost every
case Patients reduce their medications or
[SPEAKER_00]: went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no doctor supervising this this
is just a report at the survey of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they did and So just some feedback about
what the patient said is that they wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce their pharmaceutical Experienced
less pain have better sleep in this small
[SPEAKER_00]: group of patients presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These goals have been met with varying
levels of success most of all some
[SPEAKER_00]: patients received considerable reduction
in their other medication use and Overall
[SPEAKER_00]: what we learned is two years later ten of
the twelve patients were still taking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine One who had discontinued
resumed after she came for a follow-up
[SPEAKER_00]: visit because she was confused now 14 of
the 24 residents use this medicine and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cases of discontinuous, it's due to
lack of education and Inadequate follow-up
[SPEAKER_00]: that's most important with elderly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need follow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: They forget They're not sure if they're
supposed to keep spending this money or
[SPEAKER_00]: are they cured now?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm pretty much out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, here's the last slide the
biggest biggest Response that we got in
[SPEAKER_00]: the survey was we were afraid to use it
during the day So we had a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that had pain throughout the day and only
achieved remission of their pain at night
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were afraid but if they came
back and they spoke to me or they spoke to
[SPEAKER_00]: the nurse manager She encouraged them to
use it during the day Another patient came
[SPEAKER_00]: in complaining of insomnia and back pain,
but he was so afraid to use the medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: He stuck with the topical only which of
course is not good I'm gonna help him
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's some of the patient feedback and
Wow, I spoke so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one minute left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I Can tell you a little bit more about
the elderly that I treat now We have
[SPEAKER_00]: patients that come in on their own their
families bring them in I have four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: different communities, you know Assisted
living communities where the patients are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in a lot of patients come in
Because their son or grandson or some
[SPEAKER_00]: younger person is bringing them but almost
all of them are coming in because of this
[SPEAKER_00]: held out miraculous hope that they can use
CBD or they can use them the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana the one that doesn't get you
stoned and They have to be educated that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are combinations of CBD and THC that
can be had that can help them sleep for
[SPEAKER_00]: example this tincture that we used was
early days of tinctures and it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: two-to-one mix of Cannabidiol to THC so
that 35% of THC actually this strain can a
[SPEAKER_00]: tonic is pretty sedating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually did help them sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways that you can do with
strain selection and Ratios that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get the benefits of THC into a
non-altering medicine Last of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: I promised to talk about tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I went the wrong way Yes, they need to
come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to talk about taking a tolerance
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll have to be the subject of another
Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you You
