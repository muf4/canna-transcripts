[SPEAKER_00]: with the Cannabis Center of Excellence is
still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a healthcare provider,
please take a few minutes to complete the
[SPEAKER_00]: survey to help us better understand
medical cannabis knowledge, attitudes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and practices among healthcare providers

[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an added incentive, one lucky
participant will win a CanMed 2021
[SPEAKER_00]: practicum and full conference ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: The link to access that survey is in the
show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this episode is John Malonka.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through a family hardship in 2011,
John and his wife Corinne founded United
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients Group, a trusted resource and
leader in medical cannabis information and
[SPEAKER_00]: education for patients, physicians,
pharmacists, governments, and
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations, both domestically and
internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: UPG also acts as a virtual hand for
patients and their loved ones struggling
[SPEAKER_00]: with chronic and terminal illnesses by
helping them navigate through this
[SPEAKER_00]: ever-changing industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 2021, John will moderate a panel
of medical cannabis experts to discuss and
[SPEAKER_00]: answer some of the reasons why cannabis is
essential to wellness and not a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-size-fits-all medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, you will hear the
powerful story that brought medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis into John's family's life as we
explore the challenges patients face when
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning cannabis treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also discuss how the cannabis medicine
landscape has changed over the last 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years, the fact that cannabis medicine is
not a one-size-fits-all medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment needs to be personalized to each
patient, the limited guidance many
[SPEAKER_00]: patients receive from medical providers
when it comes to cannabis medicines,
[SPEAKER_00]: the limited education most healthcare
providers have on the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system, how patients can navigate through
the number of cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
John, I wanted to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, The Canigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Canigma is a cannabis education site
that's committed to making sure scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: information about cannabis is accessible
to anyone who needs it, be it to relieve
[SPEAKER_00]: their own suffering or that of a loved
one, to learn a bit more or even just for
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The site takes an evidence-based approach
to every issue surrounding cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: from safety to cooking to medical
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes all of that information
digestible and useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at Canigma.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with John Malonka.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank you first for being a
part of CanMed this year and moderating
[SPEAKER_00]: our medical panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a great talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it's going to be about
patient education, which is a great topic
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think we at CanMed and on the
podcast, we talk so much about how
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and cannabinoid therapies can
help people and the research that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sometimes forget how difficult it
can be for patients to put that
[SPEAKER_00]: information into practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, I was hoping you could
share your story of how you got involved
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis medicine, because I think
it's a nice place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it dovetails nicely into exploring the
topic of patient education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, thank you for you and your team
for even considering me and having me on,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only in your show here, but also to
lead MC the panel, which I've been in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are colleagues that I've worked
with for the past 10, 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was exciting when that
opportunity came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how we came into this, you know,
cannabis, I'm 54 years old, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so, you know, I had, you know,
cannabis was part of my life in high
[SPEAKER_01]: school and then college.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I stopped at 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny, I run into buddies from
the old days and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, nothing has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, there was a whole gap in
between there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in 2000, my background has been in
branding, marketing, advertising for
[SPEAKER_01]: years, worked for travel websites and
magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was constantly on the road and my
wife was like, come on, babe, we got to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something that keeps you home because she
was always on the road with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were coming by a, uh, uh,
this is 2008, 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were driving by a, um, conference that
had medical cannabis cuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it was a high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something else at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, pull over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I called her Mary Poppins cause she
didn't drink and smoke worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she had just picked me up at the
airport and I said, pull over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went over, went in there and
everyone was setting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
but you know, everyone was setting up
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we walked through there and we met
some cool people just setting up and we
[SPEAKER_01]: got back in the car and we said,
how is this medical?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how is this medical?
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't anything medical in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so our brain started going and we
said, let's do something for medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started brainstorming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met a, uh, web design, web developer,
and we started putting some things
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then out of the blue, my father-in-law
was Superbowl Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was outside barbecuing and he comes up
and he says, I have something to share
[SPEAKER_01]: with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, what's that thinking he and my
mother-in-law bought a Winnebago traveling
[SPEAKER_01]: or do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I have lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hadn't smoked, just show you the
repercussions that I think he hadn't
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked in 20 or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just show you the repercussions of
cigarette smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go in and they'll take care
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did do around the chemo radiation and
then knocked him on his butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went from a healthy 77 year old man
to looking like a prisoner of war,
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 seven oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, just wilting away, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about a year and a half prior to that,
or probably about a year prior to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: my father passed away, not from cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was just an emotional wreck one
now they hadn't ever experienced a passing
[SPEAKER_01]: in their family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard my cringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grandparents are still alive at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: They passed at 98, 97 and they've been
together since age 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: So isn't that, isn't that what's life
supposed to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he went back in after treating his lung
cancer and it turned out it metastasized
[SPEAKER_01]: to his brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he has a double whammy and now
they've given him two weeks to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, I said, may I go into your next
oncology appointment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wield them in with oxygen tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, he was just wilting away and
we asked the oncologist, how much time do
[SPEAKER_01]: we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she looked at us in shock and said,
you know, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, this is my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, probably two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through tears, I said, there has to be
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, I can give you morphine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I'm not in any pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at Corinne and I looked at my
in-laws and I was a stupid boyfriend and I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't the husband yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, I don't mean to offend you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was popping up all over
California, all these dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just said, and Corinne and I had
come across a study that should 40% of
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer patients pass a malnutrition before
cancer takes over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with AIDS patients,
wasting and wasting, wasting, and then die
[SPEAKER_01]: off, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, I don't mean to offend you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, what about medical cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, what about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't even know medical then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, what about cannabis for,
and I probably called it marijuana then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what, what about marijuana for
appetite help with, because you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: munchies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the doctor said, I know nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ain't about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, deem Corinne the caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ran down to dispensary and she knew
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she had never tried cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, we went down there and back
then it was night and day, 2010 to what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening today in 2021 of what's out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, regulations labeling information,
quality testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, he can't smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get a pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get a chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go back and get him a chocolate bar
and then it knocked him on his butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have chills right now,
telling you this, knocked him on his butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking, oh gosh, what have I
done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I was a stupid boyfriend and I was
more scared and embarrassed than,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, like, Hey, let's get back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, please, please, please,
let's go back and try it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ran down there again to dispensary
and there was a dispensary in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank goodness we live in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll get into this, um, as the
conversation goes on and Corinne and I
[SPEAKER_01]: came across in the only reason we went
this way, we found a coconut oil capsule
[SPEAKER_01]: is an oil-based capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason we went this way,
we knew we could freeze it and cut it into
[SPEAKER_01]: slivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was no labeling on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't say one dose back in those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was say, you know, one dose,
but it was enough to fill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say to, to feed a, uh,
NFL football team, you know, and so came
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a 10 milligram capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: We froze it, just cut it into slivers,
just prayed and hope that it would,
[SPEAKER_01]: something would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within 24 hours, he wasn't totally
uncomfortable, scary high, but he was
[SPEAKER_01]: eating and he hadn't eaten in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Oh, you know, wiping the
sweat off my brow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's eating day two,
day three, day five.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's sitting up in bed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's on 24 seven oxygen and his complexion
started coming back with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: blood coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's feeding his body with food and about
day five.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's up in bed and he's typing on his iPad
or computer at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every day we would call, did he make
it through the night?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he wake up every morning?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd call to make it through the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went over their day and we go over
there and he's shuffling around the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, don't get too cocky.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, well, I have energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's part of what we said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll pass peacefully and I'll fast
forward this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still he would just take the three
milligrams every morning, just in that
[SPEAKER_01]: capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he started functioning and he's now
he's walking and at six months hospice
[SPEAKER_01]: fires him as a patient because he's
walking, he's driving, he's swinging a
[SPEAKER_01]: golf club.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said, I'll be darned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started doing a lot of research
about this miraculous plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started at that point, we had said
halt to our graph or our web designers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's don't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a built a website that people can
come to get information, get guidance,
[SPEAKER_01]: see clinical trials, see the science and
not be embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, back then, the stigma back then
is not how it was then today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then it was, you had to, you know,
look over your shoulder, who's watching
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you know, God forbid you're on a
train or a plane or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone sees that you're looking at,
you know, a marijuana website,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we wanted to build a site that
doctors and patients and families and
[SPEAKER_01]: governments and pharmacists could trust
the information and not feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: someone's looking over shoulder,
like, oh, I caught you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I caught you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by that point, we had already met a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually a couple of them were on the
panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was really excited when you
guys asked me if I would partake in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started incorporating fecal oil,
full extract cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people call it Rick Simpson
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to take anything away
from Rick Simpson oil, but Rick Simpson's
[SPEAKER_01]: protocol, Canadian skin cancer,
high THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get into this, you know,
his is take a gram, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and more is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all cancers are treated differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is again, part of what this panel
is about this clinical focus that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: a one size fits all, you know,
age, weight, current health condition,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sensitivities, the, the stage of the
ailment and God forbid it be cancerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cancer, but also, you know, drug to drug
interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what works for me, you know,
you, you and I both young males,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably a lot younger than me,
but, you know, but, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: our formulation, our guidance,
our dosing, you know, may be different,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from sensitivities and how our
bodies made up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by that point, we, at the six month
mark, we incorporated the fecal oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: still my noon amount under his tongue at
night before bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a four part THC and one part CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD ratio in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would do it at night just because
he could sleep through any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactive if there was any,
and a couple of times there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, and at nine months,
I'm fast forwarding the story and at nine
[SPEAKER_01]: months, um, the phone rang, it was 10 o
'clock at night, Crenier in bed watching
[SPEAKER_01]: TV and the phone rang and they were like,
oh my gosh, here's that dreaded call.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was my mother-in-law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We picked it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, is everything okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, check your email, jumped out of
bed, checked the email and there's an
[SPEAKER_01]: email.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they sent from their oncologist that
said no evidence of recurrent disease and
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about the tears of joy this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is signs behind this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, it does work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never want to give anybody false
hope because I've seen this plant work and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working to me is saving a life,
saving a body, working for someone else
[SPEAKER_01]: could be I sleep better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a relationship with my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to get off my opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to have movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to, you know, control my
diabetes, my epilepsy, my, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Cren and I not only having this
success story and being able to share it
[SPEAKER_01]: to the, to the world, you know,
um, people always say, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys are good ambassadors again,
bringing the stigma back in 2010,
[SPEAKER_01]: 11, 12, 13 to where it is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: People automatically thought, oh,
you just want to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went on this journey of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Education and information, education,
information, and not only educating the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients and families, but the most
important educating the doctors,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, patients now, you know,
cannabis is not going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good or bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the first to say that's not for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never say cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never say it's the golden Willy
Wonka ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you take this and you're,
you're healed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, there goes, and I'm a fan
of, of a whole arsenal of getting your
[SPEAKER_01]: body back to balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's exercise, if it's diet,
if it's cannabis, if it's prayer,
[SPEAKER_01]: meditation, whatever, you know,
I, I'm a big fan of all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm a fan of conventional medicine
as well in incorporating that as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: integrative, uh, as well as functional,
and then cannabis and other, other herbs
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started on this journey of the
importance of educating doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as California was leading the way back
then it's been legal since 1996 at the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other States started to follow,
but the one thing that was lacking was no
[SPEAKER_01]: one knew what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so it would say,
Oh, great, Ben, I'm a cannabis doctor and
[SPEAKER_01]: here's your recommendation and call me in
a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what do I do now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just go down to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're, you and I are 20, we've
probably, you know, had those types of
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we won't be doing that one again,
you know, like, you know, but when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: sick or you're scared parents,
with a pediatric child, or you're a scared
[SPEAKER_01]: child with a geriatric mom and dad,
you know, or even yourself, you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that, you know, they're getting
the right guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen a lot in this industry over
the past 11, 12 years of what patients
[SPEAKER_01]: think more is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have sleep issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me take that and I'll go into the
dispensary and I have anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have an eating issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll take that and they walk out with
16, 17 products.
[SPEAKER_01]: No exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've worked with so many seniors
at retirement communities and they show me
[SPEAKER_01]: their bag of goodies that they grabbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, oh, and so that's the part,
you know, as cannabis is becoming more of
[SPEAKER_01]: an approved and I will say medicine,
a lot of people don't want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, but an approved option medicine,
you know, I think it also, as it's growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the majority of states now,
not only here in the U S but globally,
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors need to be educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's, again, it's not a one size
fits all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I share this with patients and doctors
alike that it's not illegal to ask the
[SPEAKER_01]: question, even if you're in an illegal
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some doctors are like,
I don't want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and same thing with patients and
patients, I've had them say, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, I'm going to act like you didn't ask
me that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I find out, Ben, that you use
cannabis, I'm going to ask you to get
[SPEAKER_01]: another, another doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is generally, this happens more
so in the, the senior world, the geriatric
[SPEAKER_01]: world, happened to my aunt, you know,
I've like, as I mentioned, I've spoken at
[SPEAKER_01]: retirement communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always ask the question,
how many people have tried cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: have this discussion with their doctor?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you would see the hands go up and
one, one lady, she was in the mid
[SPEAKER_01]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, my doctor shared if he,
if I did use it, that he would ask me to
[SPEAKER_01]: find another doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sat there, what'd you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, I fired him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, the laughter and the round of
applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, you know, but I applaud her
for doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is her body.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your body, you know, and you
should have options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the unfortunate thing about
cannabis being legal in some states and
[SPEAKER_01]: not others.
[SPEAKER_01]: God forbid something happens to you and
you live in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, you're getting the black market,
not safe, not safe and tested and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or two, you're forced to now be a cannabis
refugee, which a lot of families did.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few years ago now, you know,
you're, they're able to stay put.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you are a cannabis refugee,
not only leaving your support group,
[SPEAKER_01]: your family, your doctors, your schooling,
your church, your friends, everything and
[SPEAKER_01]: going here and having to start again,
you know, but a lot of parents do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: would do that for their loved one,
you know, their child or their loved one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, so that's the thing we,
we prided, we pride ourselves on is
[SPEAKER_01]: someone coined the term we were at a
conference, I think in 2011 in San Jose,
[SPEAKER_01]: California in there, we had our booth
there and someone said, you guys are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, WebMD, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, that's a great way to put it
in, in, in a, in an elevator, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: two second pitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: WebMD of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, not trying to say,
compare us, but it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a site that people can come to,
get information, meet with a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have doctors and nurses that consult
with patients and their families and their
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors on there via phone and video.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't write recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of doc, a lot of patients
will go to a doctor, as I mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier in the, in our talk, like,
okay, Ben, here's your recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me any year if you want to renewal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of the, because the doctors
don't know, they're able to do a consult
[SPEAKER_01]: with, with our staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am always invite the doctors in,
so everyone's on the same page as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, so that's why education
and information is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, as, as this is growing and all
these products are coming out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's confusing to me sometimes
when I see all these products and all
[SPEAKER_01]: these claims, you know, and that's the
thing that's frustrating is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I think until, I don't want to say
getting the government involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: but until, you know, people really look at
this as an option, you know, it's sad
[SPEAKER_01]: because I just lost a dear friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was in her mid late sixties to breast
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she successfully fought breast cancer
for 19 years on non FDA approved,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, modalities, you know, from ozone to
vitamin B 17, uh, salicinium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the list goes on, but it saved her
life for 19 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is, uh, you know, battle this and it's
frustrating that, you know, Americans,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we don't have access to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of, a lot of patients will go
overseas where they have access,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, go down to Mexico where they
have access.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some great doctors,
you know, and I think it's wonderful that
[SPEAKER_01]: these doctors actually take a stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel the same thing with cannabis,
at least have an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, doesn't work for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it doesn't, chemo and radiation
doesn't always work for everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but, but at least it's an
option.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and again, you can incorporate
those with, um, conventional medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go that route, please do
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to zero each other out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use cannabis with chemo radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with a lot of cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cancer has affected, uh, me and I'll
go into that in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, but if you are going to do
chemo radiation, cannabis helps with
[SPEAKER_01]: nausea, appetite, sleep, um, mood as well
as healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, you know, I would never tell
anybody not to do this and do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I say that how it's affected me in
2017, my wife, Corinne was diagnosed with
[SPEAKER_01]: pancreatic cancer and she was suffering
from pancreatic cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I would never tell
somebody, I mean, that's the part of life
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand is, you know,
you do, you do good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do everything you're supposed to from
treating others with respect, helping
[SPEAKER_01]: others, which we have done for,
you know, 10, 12 years here with the
[SPEAKER_01]: United Patients Group, but also she ate
well, didn't drink, worked out,
[SPEAKER_01]: stayed healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cancer and ailment does not
discriminate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing that that's the part
of life that I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, why not offer cannabis as
an option as we've seen it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen all the studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen it work with my father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_01]: My father-in-law actually just passed away
this May 2021, but not from cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: not from cancer, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm glad that he got an extra 10,
11 years of a great life.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got to experience our wedding and he
had, as sad as it is, he got to experience
[SPEAKER_01]: my wife's passing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but, you know, he was able to be
on this earth for another 10, 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know, Ben, 100% cannabis had a
major, major effect on that and why,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's why I continue the work that
Corinne and I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the outpouring of love and
support that we had not only from our
[SPEAKER_01]: community, but here in the U.S.,
but globally when they found out that
[SPEAKER_01]: Corinne passed, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I keep, you know, her spirit alive
and I still get calls from people on a
[SPEAKER_01]: regular basis saying, you know,
I met your wife at a conference or I spoke
[SPEAKER_01]: to your wife on the phone when I was going
through this and she calmed me down and
[SPEAKER_01]: she directed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what we do here at United
Pace Group is direct, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: help people avoid the tangled web in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What to ask, what to avoid, what to look
out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some top doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some top nurses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some top products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and that's the part that's
where I think this industry is going,
[SPEAKER_01]: thank goodness, but also where it still
has a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the part where the government's
getting involved, where they're adding
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so nowadays, you know, the majority,
I should say, I don't know, I'm looking
[SPEAKER_01]: around to see if I had a product here,
but the majority of products nowadays have
[SPEAKER_01]: a QR code that show a test result.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, test results not only just say,
oh yeah, it has THC or CBD or the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid profiles, but has it been
tested for mold, pesticides, metals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it safe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it USDA certified?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it grown here in the United States?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was it grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are all things that I always
share with patients as a patient advocate
[SPEAKER_01]: and a health advocate to what to look out
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, patients come to us and what if
they have two weeks like we've had and
[SPEAKER_01]: they go down the wrong way, you know,
for 10 days and realize, oh my goodness,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone the wrong way and I only have
four more days and they're running back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to have that diagnosis,
whatever it is, but having the diagnosis
[SPEAKER_01]: that your loved one has is you have
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, your world comes to a
halt and you're thinking, what can I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone comes at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much information and you're
like, you know, on this time clock that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going the other way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I've done all the talking,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, and it's a great story and thank
you so much for sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, set the stage for all the
work that you've done since it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your experience started back in 2010 up
until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to ask you about that because
you had mentioned that back in 2010 you
[SPEAKER_00]: went down to the dispensary and there
wasn't nearly the amount of products and
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of information that there is
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have to imagine that there was
some level of luck involved with the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that you got actually worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder if in some ways patients
today almost have a more difficult time
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are so many more choices and
there is so much more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like analysis paralysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is not video, but I'm smiling
as you're sharing that because I still
[SPEAKER_01]: remember walking into that dispensary and
it would just label cannabis, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, cannabis, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember after six months,
seven months, and then after having my
[SPEAKER_01]: father-in-law's hospital team fire him
because now he's walking and driving and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got involved with this industry and
met some scientists and doctors and labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't mention names, but there's a lab
here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to them and I said,
oh, can you test this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kid you not, Ben, it was exactly the
100% opposite of what they had it labeled
[SPEAKER_01]: in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really put me up going,
okay, now we have an issue here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank goodness, I don't know if we had
some higher power.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one thing that how we've always
lived our life is everything happens for a
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything happens for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess good and bad because I'm still
trying to figure out this thing with
[SPEAKER_01]: Corinne and even setting up for this call.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pictures of her around here,
but I just thought, how is this even
[SPEAKER_01]: possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: But seeing the different labeling and
regulations, and I kid you not,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was the blind leading the blind then,
and it was trial and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kid you not, Ben, knock on wood,
we had no error.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why coming out of the gate and
hitting a grand slam, right off first
[SPEAKER_01]: pitch, going, oh, we got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna share all this with everybody
because we're on a mission now to share
[SPEAKER_01]: the benefits of this plant, and we're
gonna help others heal their loved ones
[SPEAKER_01]: for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, I'm not a doctor,
and all we would do, we would share
[SPEAKER_01]: studies, we would just share what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we grew, we brought on medical
teams to do the science, the medical side
[SPEAKER_01]: of this, of guidance and dosing and
formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kid you not, before everyone,
people say there's 113 up to 160 different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll meet you in the middle there at 140.
[SPEAKER_01]: All cannabinoids play a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is what everyone has known for years,
but also has a stigma from the Reef of
[SPEAKER_01]: Madness years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's high, gets everyone stoned,
stupid, et cetera, you get nothing done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are so many benefits to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without THC, I know my father-in-law would
not be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The studies show that THC, yes,
it gives you a euphoric, what's wrong with
[SPEAKER_01]: being euphoric, but it gives you the high,
but it helps with mood, helps with
[SPEAKER_01]: appetite, helps with pain, but it also
helps with cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have CBD with all its other
benefits from pain and sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation, a cancer fighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time I present, I always put this
roll of duct tape up on my screen,
[SPEAKER_01]: and people look at me like, hey,
man, you got the wrong screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I said, I don't want to say cannabis
is like duct tape with a million and one
[SPEAKER_01]: uses, but when you really get down to it,
all the cannabinoids play a part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're able to intertwine these,
called the entourage effect, they really
[SPEAKER_01]: work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Corinna would always describe it as
like baking a cake and leaving the eggs or
[SPEAKER_01]: flour out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they go together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you asked me one other question,
and I was going to go down that road,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were just talking about how there
being so many choices and so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different products out there now,
is it almost harder to find the right
[SPEAKER_00]: solution for you than it was back then?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going to get on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we did this with Corinne's father,
we used a four parts THC, one part CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were like, it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone came on, CBD started hitting
the road, and everyone talked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people were like, THC, it's
supposed to be CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, this is where the media has
confused a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This wonder drug CBD that just appeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis in this plant has been around for
thousands of years, thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing that we used to go,
before all these other cannabinoids were
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced, and 0.05 this and take five
milligrams of that, and one milligram of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw more success with patients just
doing a regular four to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four parts THC, one part CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was amazing what we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when other things were
incorporated of the different cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw this graph, and no disrespect to
any doctors out there, but we would see
[SPEAKER_01]: this graph of higher success, really,
I guess from certain elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used everything on my wife with
pancreatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pancreatic's a different breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I reached out to Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reached out to Eloise, who's on the
panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reached out to Dustin, who's on the
panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love Corinne.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just going through their
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she made a major impact in this
industry, but it's sad when you not only
[SPEAKER_01]: lose my wife, and my best friend,
but when others that loved her,
[SPEAKER_01]: to see one of us who helped people fall to
this thing called cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cancer does not discriminate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aliments do not discriminate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pain does not discriminate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot more work that needs
to be done for different ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDA is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBN is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's THC, CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is the thing that doctors are
afraid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want my patient to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you get the patient say, I want the
medical portion of the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the recreational portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where the media has really
confused people, because they think THC is
[SPEAKER_01]: bad, CBD is good, and all the other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I share this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brother's been in the wine business.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been in the wine business for 30
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say, you and I, Ben, can go out and
go wine tasting, take a sip of wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we drank three bottles of wine,
we're going to be intoxicated,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably throwing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with cannabis in any level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always hear them say, go low,
go slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But same thing with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have success with one,
two, three milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why not go with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started with Corinne's father,
just low amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would say, you need the high
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get up to a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were at a conference up in
Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sat down in the lounge just to get
it, because we were exhibiting as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just sat there taking a little
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could hear a doctor speaking on the
loudspeaker about cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits of low and slow, as well as
microdosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went, I'll be darned.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we've been doing for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone's been saying, no,
you got to take gram a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ran upstairs to see who it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we opened the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a packed room, standing room only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know who's on stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dustin Sulak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, I'll be darned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone surrounded him afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a few days later, Corinne and I
called him and we had a Skype call.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was back in Portland, not Portland,
Oregon, but in Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we shared our story with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, yes, these are the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, finally, someone,
because people used to say, impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are just telling us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, we're not even selling a
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when Dustin came out and other
doctors started speaking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: microdosing, people said, I'll be darned.
[SPEAKER_01]: How'd you guys know that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, it was just common sense to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was totally out and weak and shriveling
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why blast him?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be like you and I going out for,
I run and ride every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a marathon runner.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I went and ran a marathon today,
boy, my hips and my knees would be
[SPEAKER_01]: hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get up to that, but slowly build up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a block.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do five kilometers, 5K.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the same thing, I think,
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our bodies are a fine-tuned machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the part that why education
and information is so important and why as
[SPEAKER_01]: the laws are starting to expand to pretty
much all the states here in the US,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's still a lack of doctors knowing
that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a lack of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have, yes, we have legal access
to all these Americans, but the doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: still don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still say there's about,
I'm going to say, I used to say eight to
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, maybe there's 12 to 15% of doctors
that truly know about dosing nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is part of my excitement when you
guys ask me to, hey, would you like to
[SPEAKER_01]: emcee this panel?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, I would love to, especially
seeing who's on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, you're getting really the
best of the best in this industry who have
[SPEAKER_01]: been around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't just pop up because they said,
oh, I'm going to be in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they've been the pioneers in this
industry for eight, 10, 12 years as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's good to see that and that you
congrats for coming out here to the West
[SPEAKER_01]: coast this year, but to have some great
speakers in any conferences is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be part of this panel with those
medical professionals is pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew you were going to say the name
Dustin Sulak when you were describing
[SPEAKER_00]: that, because he actually has been on the
podcast before and we talked about dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: and he shared the information that he's
gathered over the years about how he calls
[SPEAKER_00]: it a biphasic effect with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That low dose can sometimes be even more
effective than the higher doses and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of follows this wave pattern,
which was really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make a great point about how
there's not enough medical professionals
[SPEAKER_00]: who are knowledgeable about the
endocannabinoid system or cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the main reasons that we
've added to CanMed, the full day medical
[SPEAKER_00]: practicum, which is a pre-conference event
that's led by Bonnie Goldstein,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dustin Sulak, Eloise Thiessen and Kevin
Spellman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the healthcare professionals can come
and get the latest information and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that clinical experience that those
medical professionals have amassed over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years so that we can kind of help to
at least increase that percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more medical professionals out
there who can give great advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you nailed them on who you have
leading that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've known Dustin, Eloise and Bonnie
for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've not taken anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do conferences anymore since CRIN
passed, but we used to do conferences and
[SPEAKER_01]: offered CME accreditation and we'd have
about 85, 90% of our attendees were
[SPEAKER_01]: actually medical professionals,
not in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dustin and Eloise and Bonnie were
always regulars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dustin and Bonnie sit on our advisory
board as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, like I said, they're part of our
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been to our home, Eloise and
Bonnie both spoke at CRIN's funeral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gonna be good seeing them and it's
gonna be really good seeing them because
[SPEAKER_01]: this is how I've been seeing everybody via
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be kind of weird standing up
there on stage and she went, wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: human beings, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: But excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we won't have to be wearing
masks while we're up there speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, we're so close though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I look at the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't watch the news, but I do see what
the COVID things are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, what are they gonna do
today?
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so anyway, winding down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I didn't wanna keep you much past a
half hour, but we've been going hard here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to leave it open to you to
maybe talk about some of the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: roadblocks or pitfalls that new cannabis
users can run into, maybe in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: different product types, formulations,
all the sorts of things that you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to address with the United Patients Group
and maybe just some good practical advice
[SPEAKER_00]: for some folks who are thinking about
getting into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two things, getting into it,
meaning into this industry, or are you
[SPEAKER_01]: talking patients looking to cannabis as an
option?
[SPEAKER_01]: More on the patient side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patient side, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, ask questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your research to see if this is for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the first to say this is not for
everyone and I do not want anyone to think
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a cure-all.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, I never used the word
cure, but there are a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: choices out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because you said, oh,
a friend of mine is a friend of a friend
[SPEAKER_01]: of a friend, knows this good stuff,
he grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or she grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known growers that have been doing
this probably longer than you and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: been alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every once in a while, they have to
cut down their whole crop because mold or
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs or something was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a fan of a friend of a friend type
of stuff, but especially when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: immune compromised and God forbid you're
battling something as severe as cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure all your products are tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays, in all the states that are
legal, they do have testing labs and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the products should have the not only
website on there or contact information,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also QR code.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't have it, this is what I
share with patients all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: go to another company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, either call the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not up to you, make sure
that has testing or it's not up to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: the patient or the consumer to go out and
test a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, I do know some patients that want
to double check, but make sure you find a
[SPEAKER_01]: product company that has all the
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of testing the soil first
because what's in that soil is very
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure there's no, you know,
they go from, I always say from soil seed
[SPEAKER_01]: to sale and check the soil, make sure it's
not toxic, doesn't have any, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: overflow stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays with hemp, you know, hemp is
known as mop weed, like mopping up a
[SPEAKER_01]: spill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times they would,
you know, in certain areas where they'd
[SPEAKER_01]: have a toxic spill, they'd grow hemp and
it would suck up the toxins and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd touch the soil again and go,
oh cool, we'll build a community here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll build church, homes, schools,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so make sure if you are, if you live
in a state that doesn't give you the
[SPEAKER_01]: option for THC products and CBD is your
only option, I think wonderful,
[SPEAKER_01]: go for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But getting it at a grocery store,
not, I'm not a big fan of getting your gas
[SPEAKER_01]: station.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fan of, there's a lot of
companies that are online, look for USDA
[SPEAKER_01]: certified, look for grown in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make sure it's tested, make sure it's
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they test, again, to make sure it
doesn't have any mold, pesticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins, and make sure the cannabinoid
profile is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For patients that work for jobs where
there's zero tolerance, meaning no THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: they do a broad spectrum, which is pure
straight CBD, which is also beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can make sure that you ask that
company before you take that chance on
[SPEAKER_01]: your job, just confirming another 100% of
the time that it is THC free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ask questions, do not be afraid to
ask questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're in your doctor's office and
you ask your doctor about cannabis and he
[SPEAKER_01]: or she does not know about that or I
prefer not to discuss it, say no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, can you recommend me to someone
who would know about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays, believe me, there's someone
in every single state that a doctor that
[SPEAKER_01]: can refer to another doctor that has that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie Goldstein, Dr. Sulak, Eloise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never met Kevin, so I'm excited to
meet Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read his bio the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, what an impressive bio on what he's
done and where he has been as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only here in the US, but overseas and
who he has worked with, not only with
[SPEAKER_01]: military, but sports, major league
sporting organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, or even come to United Pacers
Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give us a plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come to our site and get
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always reachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can contact me or you can set up a
consultation on our website that allows
[SPEAKER_01]: you to have this discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your doctor does not know,
invite them in on the call.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly believe and feel more having a
team behind you, but not only having your
[SPEAKER_01]: personal physician on there to talk and he
or she can also learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a part that really we stand by
is education as well as information
[SPEAKER_01]: education is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always use this analogy of throwing
a pebble in the pond with the ripple
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone may hear our conversation here and
go, God, I never thought about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but now I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, to anybody that's out there,
going through something as severe as
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer, I send you love, prayers,
and blessings as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not alone and ask questions
because there are some great offerings out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, not only in our industry,
but beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some great advice for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John, I want to thank you again for
coming on and sharing your story and
[SPEAKER_00]: telling us about the work that you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, thank you so much for joining

eye.

six weeks or something like that.
