[SPEAKER_00]: When we started working on cannabinoids,
which was many, many, many years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 60s, we isolated quite a large
number of compounds in hashish,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the resin of cannabis,
and of course there was a cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_00]: the major compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked in collaboration with many
friends at the activity of some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, but we still don't know much
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, there is a compound which we
called cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know very little about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to have anti-cancer properties,
but it has to be looked into much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: An antivirus has never been given to a
human, so we don't know what it does when
[SPEAKER_00]: administered to a human, which is again a
strange situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's not toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it is formed in the body when
needed and immediately broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has seen any major side effects in
animals, and yet it has never been
[SPEAKER_00]: administered to a human, although it was
discovered by us in 1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare this to what happened with insulin
when insulin was discovered in the body in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 20s in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within six months, it became a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was given to a few patients after they
found that it is not toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given to a few patients, insulin was found
to lower diabetes, and it became a drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: an excellent drug, still widely used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We synthesized new compounds which are
much more active than cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are developing them, and hopefully
they can become new drugs the moment we
[SPEAKER_00]: have more practical things, looking at
endogenous cannabinoid-like compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which seem to be of major importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what I'm doing at the moment is
collaborate with a huge number of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we do the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a thing that we can start,
initiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My collaborators do the biology in
different fields, and together we come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with something that hopefully contributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of research, and it involves
investment in the people that do the work
[SPEAKER_00]: in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a small group, two or three people
working part-time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find money to support the lab
and support the people that work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are still basic things that have to
be learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strangely enough, still after so many
years, we don't know enough about the
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, the activity of the compounds
in the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very strange, but that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a lot about DHC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a lot of CBD, but we know very
little about some of the other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We
know a lot about some of the other
compounds, but we know a lot about some of
the other compounds.
