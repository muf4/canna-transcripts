[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great episode for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a conversation with Martin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee, the co-founder and director of
Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to creating content for the
Project CBD website and speaking at
[SPEAKER_00]: conferences around the globe, Martin has
authored several books, including Smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: Signals, A Social History of Marijuana,
Medical, Recreational, and Scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great read.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have a copy in our office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin and I discussed the topic everyone
is talking about, COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin has reviewed the scientific
literature to find out whether CBD can
[SPEAKER_00]: calm the cytokine storm that the COVID
virus can set off, whether CBD has
[SPEAKER_00]: antiviral properties, and if cannabis is
an immune booster, suppressant,
[SPEAKER_00]: or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can imagine, with a virus as new
and novel as COVID-19 and a federal ban on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, the research is far from
conclusive, but I think you will see there
[SPEAKER_00]: is some potential in some areas that merit
future research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we will see some compelling data at
a future CanMed event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to my conversation,
we are proud to have Project CBD as our
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Project CBD is an educational news service
reporting on cannabidiol, other components
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cannabis plant, and herbal medicine
synergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at ProjectCBD.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
here is my conversation with Martin Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just want to thank you again for
taking the time to join us during what I
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine must be a hectic time for you and
your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you were personally affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic, so first, how are you
[SPEAKER_00]: and your wife doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I am not showing any symptoms,
but my wife was infected, and she is now
[SPEAKER_01]: just out of quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a relatively mild case of the
COVID-19 virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, it is not always mild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be sometimes fatal, but there is a
spectrum of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are obviously interested in how
cannabis in general and CBD in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: might affect that entire spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the main reasons I wanted
to talk to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did see the article that you published
on Project CBD about just this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the interaction between COVID-19,
CBD, and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must admit, I have seen a lot of
articles out there trying to tackle this
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, and I will be honest, a lot of them
have tuned out because they make a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: bold claims, but I was very happy to see
that yours was very well-reasoned and
[SPEAKER_00]: well-researched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, what prompted you to want to
write this article?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I should say initially, when you
consider the therapeutic promise and
[SPEAKER_01]: potential of CBD in particular and
cannabis, there is an awful lot there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and one does not need to exaggerate an
overstate, and I do think there is a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of exaggeration and
assumption and overstatements happening
[SPEAKER_01]: with respect to cannabis and CBD and the
pandemic that we are experiencing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we felt it was important to
address this issue because it is the
[SPEAKER_01]: burning issue of the day, and there is a
lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do use cannabis for
therapeutic purposes or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: An obvious question is how will that usage
impact the virus, the course of the virus,
[SPEAKER_01]: their exposure, and symptoms if one does
come down with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an important issue because of what
is happening today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reading through the article,
it seems like one of the primary things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you tackled was looking at whether
cannabis or CBD specifically can calm this
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokine storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I am pronouncing that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, can you explain what exactly that
is and why it is dangerous?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the most severe reaction to the
COVID-19 virus involves what scientists
[SPEAKER_01]: refer to as a cytokine storm syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: In The Lancet, the eminent British
journal, they drew attention to the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that the evidence indicates that people
dying of this disease are experiencing
[SPEAKER_01]: what they refer to as a cytokine storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: In essence, it is not the virus that is
killing people because if that were the
[SPEAKER_01]: case, then anyone exposed would die.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is resulting in mortality is how the
body reacts to the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: In extreme cases, there is an intense
immune overreaction in the lungs and that
[SPEAKER_01]: is what can actually kill someone or sick
someone to a very significant degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, it involves a respiratory
distress which is the leading cause of
[SPEAKER_01]: death with the COVID-19 cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it is an intense autoimmune
reaction to the virus and that is what the
[SPEAKER_01]: cytokine storm syndrome is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is an autoimmune or immune
overreaction, it raises the question,
[SPEAKER_01]: what can be done to treat this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need something that is going to
suppress the immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis and CBD in particular,
but also THC, notoriously have
[SPEAKER_01]: immunosuppressing effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the reason why cannabis can be
very effective for people with autoimmune
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases, of which there are many
different kinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the immune system overreacts to a
misperceived threat, an autoimmune
[SPEAKER_01]: condition can result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis can be very effective for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It raises the question, well, if the
COVID-19 virus in the most extreme form of
[SPEAKER_01]: the disease is an intense immune response,
might cannabis or might CBD in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: be helpful in that regard?
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is we really do not know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has not been any tests in this
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Theoretically, you can posit that the
autoimmune or the anti-inflammatory aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: of CBD and THC potentially, if it could be
harnessed, might be a treatment down the
[SPEAKER_01]: road for something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The evidence at this point is fragmentary
and sketchy, but it is compelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: There really ought to be research in this
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we do not have that
research to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cytokines specifically, how do
cannabinoids interact with them or even
[SPEAKER_00]: end cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that all work together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, these cytokines, they are really a
group of proteins that regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammatory responses to diseases and
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are secreted by immune cells,
the cytokines.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cytokine can be either pro-inflammatory
or anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, it is a pro-inflammatory
messenger.
[SPEAKER_01]: An example would be the tumor necrosis
factor alpha.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a cytokine that is produced in
excess in cases of rheumatoid arthritis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a very painful autoimmune
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It afflicts more than a million people in
the United States in that condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: What cannabis could do is it can suppress
inflammation in various different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the cannabinoid receptors,
as you may know, there are two,
[SPEAKER_01]: CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CB2 receptor is present in immune
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that is activated by THC or in other
ways, that will confer an auto,
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say, an anti-inflammatory
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD does not directly activate the CB2
receptor, but it seems to do so indirectly
[SPEAKER_01]: or it has many effects that are parallel
or similar to activation of the CB2
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both CBD and THC are very potent
anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a pro-inflammatory
expression of the cytokines, this is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that could be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there are other things like
corticosteroids and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how steroids operate as
anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're appropriate perhaps for acute
inflammatory flare-ups, but unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: in cases of the cytokine storm,
that is not always the case with
[SPEAKER_01]: corticosteroids because they could be
harmful in their own right to the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lungs is the focus of the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think scientists are looking for other
options other than corticosteroids to
[SPEAKER_01]: treat a cytokine storm syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it might be down the road that CBD
or other cannabinoids could be developed
[SPEAKER_01]: in this way, but we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, is another example of there just not
being enough research, it seems,
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could credit that to federal
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has really been a major obstacle to
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we seem to be the bitter fruit of
that, but hopefully that will shift in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hopefully some researchers will kind
of take up that mantle and start doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to see that presented at CanMed
one of these years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you got into- I think it
should because- No, go ahead, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to add if I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, there is a compelling scenario to
justify this kind of research because pure
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, single molecule CBD, something like
Epidiolex, for example, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribed for epileptics, CBD is now
being tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And showing some degree of success for
what's called graft versus host disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is also an extreme autoimmune
reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens when someone receives an organ
transplant and rejects the organ.
[SPEAKER_01]: That often can be fatal, that rejection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a graft versus host disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually fatal in 80% of the cases,
and there is really no treatment for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBD, because it is a very potent
anti-inflammatory, is now being looked at-
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a clinical trial in Israel that's
ongoing- as a treatment for graft versus
[SPEAKER_01]: host disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a parallel there because both
graft versus host disease and the cytokine
[SPEAKER_01]: storm associated with extreme reactions to
the COVID virus, they are both autoimmune
[SPEAKER_01]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important to keep in mind that
with the COVID-19 virus, it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: virus-induced phenomenon, whereas with the
graft versus host disease, it is not
[SPEAKER_01]: virally induced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is some reason to be hopeful
that CBD could be harnessed its
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic potential in both of these
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's a good segue because
another thing that the article got into
[SPEAKER_00]: was sort of looking at whether CBD can
actually be used as an anti-viral agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does the research say about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's some hints of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of research that shows
this, but a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one study that showed,
or at least suggested, that CBD had a
[SPEAKER_01]: direct anti-viral effect against hepatitis
C virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was only one preclinical study,
and there's really nothing else that shows
[SPEAKER_01]: that CBD has this direct anti-viral
properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it does show, though, in certain
situations, virally induced diseases can
[SPEAKER_01]: be expressed in terms of inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD can temper the inflammation of the
viral-induced disease without necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: directly affecting the virus itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a possibility, and there are
several studies that suggest that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as for direct anti-viral activity,
there's not a lot out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of reducing the inflammation
associated with a viral-induced disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's quite possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what about just kind of having an
optimized endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sort of help an individual be
able to fight off a viral infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a little tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Project CBD, we've gotten a lot of
emails from people asking questions and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes complaining that we haven't put
out stern warnings against people taking
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis during this period, the
suggestion being because CBD is
[SPEAKER_01]: immunosuppressive, typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not be a good idea to be
consuming CBD or THC or cannabis at the
[SPEAKER_01]: present time because it might make one
more susceptible to the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no indication that that's actually
the case, but there are some concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when we talk about the
endocannabinoid system and the immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system, it's a little tricky because it's
not like a one-way street.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that simply the endocannabinoid
system will have a suppressive effect
[SPEAKER_01]: against immune activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could.
[SPEAKER_01]: When there is an overreaction of the
immune system, the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system's job, as you might say,
is to temper that almost like a dimmer
[SPEAKER_01]: switch to turn down overactive immune
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a normal situation, that doesn't
seem to be the case that that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a situation where one is not dealing
with an autoimmune disease, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: seem that cannabis or cannabinoids such as
CBD and THC has a negative effect on the
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, it might be the opposite
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might help the endocannabinoid system
to tone, to do its job as a tonifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rather than just suppressing immune
activity, it seems that evidence suggests
[SPEAKER_01]: now that cannabinoids have an
immunomodulating effect, which could
[SPEAKER_01]: entail suppressing immune activity when
that's important to do, but otherwise just
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of maintaining things and keeping
things at a healthy level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: When one has a fever that's necessary to
fight an infection, the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system doesn't turn down the fever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't turn down the anti-inflammatory
response until it's OK to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like it steps out of the way and
gets out of the way so that the immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system can do its thing and fight off the
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a healthy situation, it's just
simply there helping to modulate,
[SPEAKER_01]: helping to boost endocannabinoid tone so
that the endocannabinoid system does its
[SPEAKER_01]: job well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can really go either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we talk about immunomodulation,
again, it could be suppressive or it could
[SPEAKER_01]: be allowing the immune system to act as it
needs to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one study of the HIV virus that
suggested that cannabis consumption can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually boost immune activity in that
regard, which would be helpful when
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with AIDS or HIV infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that underscores how, with
cannabinoids, they can go in two
[SPEAKER_01]: directions, that the endocannabinoid
system operates in a bidirectional way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can calm an overexcited nervous system
or it can boost a situation where there's
[SPEAKER_01]: less energy than needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the endocannabinoid system will
modulate both glutamate, which is an
[SPEAKER_01]: excitatory neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, as a dimmer switch using that
analogy, it will kind of tone down
[SPEAKER_01]: overexcitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if one's imbalance is in the other
direction and one is too sluggish,
[SPEAKER_01]: if maybe the GABA is more prominent,
which is a depressive neurotransmitter,
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoid system can slow down
GABA, meaning it can speed things up
[SPEAKER_01]: overall in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it underscores how it operates in a
bidirectional capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the CBD and THC, since they're
operating through the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system, whether directly or indirectly,
will also have a bidirectional effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that will apply to the immune system
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can move things in either direction,
and hopefully it will do so when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary in a healthy way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coming back to the question,
should one be consuming cannabis at this
[SPEAKER_01]: time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't really say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it would be harmful if
one is not affected with the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one should keep in mind that it is
immunosuppressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's reflected, actually,
now in the sales of cannabis products and
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, CBD products, they've been driving
the natural supplement market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been the biggest seller for the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the pandemic has erupted,
if anything, it seems that the sales are
[SPEAKER_01]: slowing down of CBD products, and people
are turning to other supplements that are
[SPEAKER_01]: known specifically to boost immune
function, whereas CBD as sort of a default
[SPEAKER_01]: mode would tend to be immunosuppressive in
most situations, but not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's tricky because the virus itself
and how the disease expresses is different
[SPEAKER_01]: at different phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what might be helpful at one phase of
the disease might be harmful at another
[SPEAKER_01]: phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to boost immune response,
maybe cannabis and CBD and THC wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: the best things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to suppress immune response,
well, that could be ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're talking about the phase of
the disease that's most critical,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cytokine storm syndrome, you're
talking about an intense immune response,
[SPEAKER_01]: an intense inflammatory response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where in these situations, an
anti-inflammatory compound like CBD or THC
[SPEAKER_01]: or cannabis in general might conceivably
be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really tricky because in these
situations, we're dealing with a cytokine
[SPEAKER_01]: storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that if a cannabinoid could
actually be effective in this situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would probably need a pretty high dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And high doses of cannabinoids tend to
have the opposite effect of lower doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if low doses are immunosuppressive,
maybe very high doses would be just the
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite, which is what you wouldn't need
in a cytokine storm syndrome situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, cannabinoids, which have
often been described as biphasic,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning low doses have a certain response,
high doses have an opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be that when you're dealing with
something like a cytokine storm syndrome,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could be entering a sort of a
triphasic realm where a really high dose
[SPEAKER_01]: of a cannabinoid, such as CBD,
could not simply have an opposite effect
[SPEAKER_01]: of a low dose, but would be almost
amplifying what a low dose would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one shouldn't be cavalier about these
things and make statements as if one could
[SPEAKER_01]: be certain about what would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one should emphasize that we don't
know, at least in terms of exposure,
[SPEAKER_01]: short of dealing with a cytokine storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it would be harmful either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think one has to be careful about
these things and has to use their own
[SPEAKER_01]: judgment, ultimately, at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's interesting, at least,
to look at the mechanisms, look at what's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going on with these conditions,
and then sort of look to see what CBD or
[SPEAKER_00]: the different cannabinoids, what effect
they have on the system, and just sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: try to draw some parallels and say,
like you've been saying this whole time
[SPEAKER_00]: and you say in your article, there's
potential here, but we just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of value in
that, at least, to sort of explore whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not it's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we could take the
next step and actually do the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got to imagine that it must be
tough to do that in a situation like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokine storm, because it's a very
dangerous situation that is probably being
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with a number of different drugs
to really sort of isolate what's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: what must be very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think, obviously, you'd have to go
through a step-by-step process,
[SPEAKER_01]: and preclinical research involving animal
models would be necessary here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's enough information out there
that could make a compelling case that
[SPEAKER_01]: this should be explored, that one should
explore this direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so much criminal that it hasn't
happened up until this point, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not like cytokine storms is something that
we only learned about recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been implicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: A century ago, in the Spanish flu
pandemic, it's thought that the deaths
[SPEAKER_01]: resulted in, or in that pandemic,
50 million people died worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 1918, 1920 during that period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I lost my train of thought there a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientists have known about cytokines and
cytokine storm syndrome for some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no one has really investigated whether
cannabinoids could be a treatment in this
[SPEAKER_01]: regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can happen with the normal annual
flu as well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but usually that doesn't result in a
cytokine storm, that kind of extreme
[SPEAKER_01]: overreaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluids are obviously dangerous,
and they could be fatal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's kind of an interesting analogy
here is that when one compares the
[SPEAKER_01]: expression of lung disease in people who
have died because of vaping poor products,
[SPEAKER_01]: poor cannabis oil products or CBD oil
products, unlicensed products,
[SPEAKER_01]: typically what the symptomology shows,
what's referred to as ground glass
[SPEAKER_01]: opacities in the lungs, it looks like the
lungs, like they're filled with ground
[SPEAKER_01]: glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly, that shows up in cytokine
storms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The symptomology is described as ground
glass opacities in the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both the vaping disease and the
COVID-19 are lung diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: People die from respiratory failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something worth looking at there
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't suggest vaping unlicensed
products now to deal during this period.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, one should avoid those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're talking about immune
overreactions and people dying from the
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system rejecting what's going on in
the lungs, there is a similarity between
[SPEAKER_01]: the vaping illness we saw during the past
summer and what we're seeing today with
[SPEAKER_01]: the cytokine storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I meant to ask you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's a number of different
ways that you can consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the current state of there being
the potential for a COVID infection,
[SPEAKER_00]: would someone who regularly smokes
cannabis or vapes, are they at any higher
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of having a negative response should
they actually contract COVID?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they setting themselves up for a bad
time, for lack of a better term?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that's been discussed a
little bit in the cannabis press,
[SPEAKER_01]: as it were.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem here is for so long,
the authorities have been crying wolf
[SPEAKER_01]: about cannabis and making claims of harm
that are either exaggerated or fabricated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point now, when we're hearing
warnings from doctors and officials,
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking marijuana, smoking cannabis could
harm the lungs and make you more
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible to COVID-19 or exacerbate it
if one is exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the crying wolf phenomenon that we've
heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: People ignore it because there's been,
for lack of a better word, just so much
[SPEAKER_01]: bullshit about cannabis that's been said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's unfortunate because frankly,
at this point, anything that weakens the
[SPEAKER_01]: lungs, that irritates the lungs,
and that would include tobacco smoking or
[SPEAKER_01]: just air pollution, which is a more
serious problem, the air pollution,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a risk factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people should recognize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, obviously better to vape if you're
using a good product than to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less irritating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or obviously better to consume cannabis in
other ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: One can ingest edibles or drink beverages
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably wise to do that in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lung health can be supplemented by jogging
a little bit each day and just doing
[SPEAKER_01]: things to stay healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis in general is best used as part
of a healthy lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's underscored.
[SPEAKER_01]: That message should be underscored in the
current moment given what we're dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we're sort of
trying to consider, trying to look into is
[SPEAKER_00]: what about cannabis itself being infected
with COVID-19?
[SPEAKER_00]: Us at Medicinal Genomics, we do a lot of
work in microbial safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking for different molds,
different bacteria that might be infecting
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, bat guano is sometimes used
as a plant fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And could that potentially be infecting
the plant in some way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess it's something worth
considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's very interesting in these
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very interesting that you should
bring that up about bat guano.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really had never thought of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that bat guano is considered an
excellent supplement for fertilizing
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally want to think of it as quite
safe, organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not chemical and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's worth researching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Medicinal Genomics is probably
well positioned to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through genomic research, I think one
could identify a virus in a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly identify mold and other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be really great if one could
look into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we're also dealing with
what was at least initially somewhat of a
[SPEAKER_01]: localized phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thought to be originating in China.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one shouldn't assume that if indeed
there was a transfer from bats to humans
[SPEAKER_01]: that might have sparked this crisis,
that that would also be the case in bat
[SPEAKER_01]: guano that's used as a supplement for
cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're talking about different
areas of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely worth considering and
looking into.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an intriguing notion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the other things that you had
gotten into sort of in the later parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: your article was sort of just the current
situation that we're in with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and how certain restrictions
might be actually putting folks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry at higher risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that you pointed out
was that banking restrictions mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries have to deal in cash,
which exposes them more to the virus than
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were, say, using a debit card or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a very interesting
thing to point out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want to expand on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's not just the cannabis
workers or people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tax collectors because people have
businesses pay their taxes in cash and
[SPEAKER_01]: literally wheelbarrows of cash are brought
over to the appropriate places every
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter where you have to pay the
quarterly tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the absurd situation we're
in because cannabis is caught between
[SPEAKER_01]: betwixt in between illegal or being legal
on a state level, at least in a state like
[SPEAKER_01]: California or Massachusetts, for that
matter, and many other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: But federal laws, federal law and banking
privileges are not extended to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that will change, perhaps in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just another way that
prohibition, federal prohibition,
[SPEAKER_01]: is dangerous and contributes to the
problems that we're having today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just simply that federal
prohibition has blocked research that we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really know to what extent CBD or
cannabis can have an antiviral effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would be really nice to know now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know that because of federal
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also are consigned to dealing with
cash in terms of the cannabis economy
[SPEAKER_01]: because of federal prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have to consider the fact that
many people in jail are in jail because of
[SPEAKER_01]: drug crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in prison because of cannabis
violations, I think, over 40,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are over 40,000 cannabis prisoners
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's probably no place worse to be
now than in a prison because it's closed
[SPEAKER_01]: quarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And prisons are hotbeds for the COVID-19
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And prisoners are dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prison workers are being infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's another aspect of how the drug
war and cannabis prohibition has
[SPEAKER_01]: contributed negatively to the situation
we're now in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least I guess one silver lining
is that at least in my state, in
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts and yours in California and
others, at least cannabis is being
[SPEAKER_00]: considered essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that's a step in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start maybe correcting some of
these wrongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're coming up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sooner or later, we hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know we're coming up on the time
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to give you a chance to tell
the folks where they can learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: you or some of the work that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Project CBD, it's projectcbd.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a website that's dynamic and a
good source of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been in this game for now 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were involved in actually introducing
CBD into the medical marijuana world in
[SPEAKER_01]: California back in 2010, and it spread
from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the website is a really good
source of information, a good educational
[SPEAKER_01]: resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're interested in all aspects of
cannabis and cannabinoids, particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: the therapeutic and scientific dimensions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you pointed out, we try to stay
current and focus on the important
[SPEAKER_01]: stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly COVID-19 today is preeminent
in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said at the top of the interview,
we're very happy to have you at CAM-Ed
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020 for this year.
