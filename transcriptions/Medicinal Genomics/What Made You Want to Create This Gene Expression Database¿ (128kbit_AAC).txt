[SPEAKER_00]: So I think to start, it would be great if
you could tell us what inspired you to
[SPEAKER_00]: undertake this study of cannabis and focus
on developing a gene expression database.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, I would say that the recent
changes in the regulation of cannabis use
[SPEAKER_01]: and cultivation around the world have
opened up opportunities to research with
[SPEAKER_01]: these species to be conducted more
broadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has led to a rapid increase in the
amount of information available about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So including RNA sequence data,
however, these data are often in the raw
[SPEAKER_01]: form, meaning that while the RNA sequence
of files are available in public
[SPEAKER_01]: databases, for example, without proper
filtering and analysis, they aren't very
[SPEAKER_01]: affirmative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And additional to this, not all of this
data are linked to published scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where the idea of the Cannabis
Expression Atlas came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal was to create a database that
translates the RNA-seq data, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: transforming raw sequence information into
easy-to-use and refined data to anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're translating that data to make it
more useful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I noticed when I was reading
through the abstract in the paper is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you chose to use the Jamaican lion
reference, which again, near and dear to
[SPEAKER_00]: our heart at Medicinal Genomics,
our team is the one who put that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that reference benefit the
study?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, during my nation research,
I realized that there was no consensus
[SPEAKER_01]: about which reference genome to use in
cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this made me want to look further to
available genomes for these species to
[SPEAKER_01]: choose the most suitable one for use in
our study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found that most of other genomes came
from female plants and were from type 1 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 3 hemotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when the Jamaican lion genome
caught my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because first, it's a type 2 variety,
which means that it has both G8CAS and
[SPEAKER_01]: CBGAS genes active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And additionally, both male and female
plants were sequenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the researchers from the Medicinal
Genomics had identified a region
[SPEAKER_01]: corresponding to the white chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a key feature compared to
other available genomes, because which,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I mentioned, are all from female
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using this genome as a reference allow
us to enrich our database and identify
[SPEAKER_01]: expression patterns for white chromosomes
genes, for example, which can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: useful for helping researchers to better
understand sex differentiation in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, for example.
And this is a key feature compared to
other available genomes, because which,
as I mentioned, are all from female
plants.
And this is a key feature compared to
other available genomes, because which,
as I mentioned, are all from female
plants.
So using this genome as a reference for
this study, I found that most of the
genomes that are available to use in the
study are from female plants.
