[SPEAKER_00]: Is total abstinence from THC a solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it is the textbook solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how in your experience, um,
with abstinence, uh, how do you people do?
[SPEAKER_01]: It leaves some to be desired, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Megan, uh, have you ever seen,
I'm sure you've seen patients go
[SPEAKER_01]: abstinent, but have you ever seen anybody,
you know, not go abstinent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, all the time people continue
to, to use, um, often not believing their
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that they feel like they can still
continue to use low amounts balance and
[SPEAKER_02]: manage their symptoms that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but for the, like, that is
interestingly like one of the only
[SPEAKER_02]: published criteria for CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is, you know, that symptoms, if your
symptoms go away after six months of
[SPEAKER_02]: abstinence, then it's likely that you had
CHS six months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but it is, you know, if it's like
the presumed cause, then taking away the
[SPEAKER_02]: cause is likely going to be the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that for some reason that
pisses a lot of people off, like we're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually getting at the root cause of this
and they're like, there's no cure for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you take away the cause of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, uh, that's an interesting,
you know, paradigm that I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, but yeah, it's, um, that really
is the only, the only known thing to help
[SPEAKER_02]: with CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's recovery is a roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you stop using and then go
away and, you know, stopping use can then
[SPEAKER_02]: trigger episodes down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and people are using their
cannabis to stop an episode from
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they stop using, and then it
triggers an episode or they have stopped
[SPEAKER_02]: using for a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they eat some food that triggers
them or alcohol or a stressful event
[SPEAKER_02]: triggers a CHS episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they haven't used in three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're covering- Now they don't think
they have CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this dysregulation or this
imbalance sort of lingers in our system
[SPEAKER_01]: for an extended period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients sometimes reporting 12 months
before they feel the pain or the pain or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, but it's just, it's something
that's become a whole again.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a GI perspective, the damage in the,
the inflammation that went on during
[SPEAKER_01]: their, uh, in, you remember people
suffered for years without knowing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people on these discussion
boards that suffered for 15 years with the
[SPEAKER_01]: condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd seen every doctor, no one knew what
it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been taking medicine and had
all the scopes and done everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, But the, where did it, how did I get
on this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Megan?
[SPEAKER_01]: what you were just talking about.
Recovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recovery being a roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so what I always counsel my
patients on is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like patient yesterday hadn't consumed
cannabis in nine days and she was in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of an episode and it was triggered,
you know, at Disneyland from a hot
[SPEAKER_01]: burrito, a birria taco or something of
this effect, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what set her off into this
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't, you know, we don't fully know
what the timeline looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to ask you questions about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take our survey or you send this to
your friend, we're going to ask about how
[SPEAKER_01]: long after you quit, did you have
symptoms?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can tell you my personal,
you know, practice experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a CHS sufferer, but in my
experience talking to patients that have
[SPEAKER_01]: it, we're seeing easily seven days,
usually 21 to 30 days and sometimes 60
[SPEAKER_01]: plus days of, Oh, I just had an episode
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was a stress, like Megan said,
maybe it was some weird food that you
[SPEAKER_01]: thought you could try again because it
made you sick a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: What had happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know, but we're trying to put
that together so we can use that to
[SPEAKER_01]: educate patients, help them know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause physicians aren't telling patients
to, I shouldn't say any, most physicians
[SPEAKER_01]: are not, not telling folks that,
Hey, you might have more vomiting over the
[SPEAKER_01]: next few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should expect to have more vomiting
over the next few days, even though I
[SPEAKER_01]: believe you and you quit three days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that conversation is not happening
because physicians aren't aware enough or
[SPEAKER_01]: frankly, the data doesn't help them right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of evidence for them to
lean on and say, Oh yeah, most patients
[SPEAKER_01]: will have another episode in the next 21
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what, again, the survey is
trying to give them some info to lean on
[SPEAKER_01]: to more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitively know sort of how to
categorize and then how to treat as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to throwing a label on something,
throwing an anti-psychotic to help get
[SPEAKER_01]: them out of the emergency room and sending
people on their merry way, which
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately happens more often than not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's, that's new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, done a few episodes on this
and seen some CanMed talks on it and
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously seen other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize the roller coaster of
recovery there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, you know, you, you abstain
your, your symptoms go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting that other things
can sort of trigger it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, not that I'm a clinician,
but my thought with that, and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me if I'm on the right track is,
you know, other things are interfacing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the endocannabinoid system,
not just cannabinoids and other things
[SPEAKER_00]: can, can kind of cause spikes in your
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think that's perhaps what's
going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like certain stressors, triggers,
can sort of just dysregulate that system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll hit on one point of that is
that oftentimes people in recovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Okay.
