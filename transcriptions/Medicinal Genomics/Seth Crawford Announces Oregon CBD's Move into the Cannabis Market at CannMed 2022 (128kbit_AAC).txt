[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, everyone, back to the CanMed
Coffee Talk Lounge here at CanMed 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Ben Amaralt, host of the
CanMed Coffee Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have Seth Crawford here joining me
in the Coffee Talk Lounge, our Cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: Keynote presenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how nice is it to be back at an
in-person event here at CanMed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you looking to get out of the
event?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first time that we've gone to
a conference in three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very excited about a number of the
presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just really excited to see what's happened
in three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been an absolute, just obvious
decline in public events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to be a great chance to
reconnect with a lot of people that were
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily even in the story three
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned presentations that
you're looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really looking forward to Keith Allen's
talk on terpenes, Jordan Zager's talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: On sort of the whole pantheon of how to
create good cannabis for consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stoked about Kevin McKernan's talk on
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We played a small role in that and doing
some of the early sequencing work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very excited to see what
direction that's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be perfectly honest, I'm very
excited, probably the most excited to see
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia Holloway talking about THCV
breeding efforts with phylose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I'm excited about it is I
can't wait to see how people react to
[SPEAKER_01]: phylose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And THCV, you have some experience
breeding that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THCV is identical to CBDV, CBGV,
CBCV, et cetera, in terms of the precursor
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that presentation is really going
to be about are the underlying genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: regions of interest that make varine
production possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The findings are going to be interesting
because it's probably going to be the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did that with the SNP chip along
with urofins and medicinal genomics about
[SPEAKER_01]: two years ago to identify different
chromosomes that had associations with
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's polygenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spread across at least six different
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very difficult from a breeding
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of her talk is about THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real underlying information is
about those precursor genes that allow all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the other cannabinoids to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been doing identical parallel
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very curious to see what they found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting you say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I understand this correctly,
so it's the same enzymes or the same
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways creating THCA or THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that precursor molecule that's
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the gene responsible for THC production
is the same gene that makes THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a THCAS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing is true with CBDAS,
CBCAS, and the underlying CBGAS on
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosome X that's responsible for
creating all the precursors.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, you're just looking at two
different metabolic pathways, one that's
[SPEAKER_01]: pental, one that's propyl with different
upstream regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of our research has basically been
looking at the propyl version of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the upstream components.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is the importance of THCV or
what is the potential use for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were using it to help farmers get
around some of the regulatory requirements
[SPEAKER_01]: with industrial hemp production because
THCV, when it's in the plant, is not part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the 0.3 total THC that's allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can basically create higher
cannabinoid content plants that have both
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD and CBDV in the fraction while
reducing the total amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: From medical perspective, I'm really not
an expert on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people who are studying it have
looked at a number of different potential
[SPEAKER_01]: applications specifically related to the
things that are interesting to me anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at diabetes and potential help
with insulin resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's absolutely fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, it's about making these compounds
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: THCV has not been available widely,
neither CBDV or CBGV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting these into people's hands is
really what's going to tell us what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're effective in treating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we mentioned, you're a keynote
presenter, and the title of your talk is
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis 2022, the Golden Year of
Discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, back when you first signed on to be
the keynote presenter, that was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be CanMed 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the title of your talk was
Cannabis 2020, the Golden Year of
Discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what has happened in those two
years and how are you going to cram that
[SPEAKER_00]: all into a one hour presentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So much information and quite honestly
busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just recycled the same the same title.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reality, the underlying reality
here is that cannabis as a plant doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really give a damn about social
constructs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years are the same to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter if it's still alive and
able to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the golden year for the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think being able to look at this
from the perspective of plants rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: from the human perspective is sometimes
enlightening in terms of the way that we
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so much about social constructs
as it is understanding that just being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to have these plants available to us
and being able to use them is probably one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the best times to be alive in this
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of real research that has
happened in the last three years,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were shooting in the dark in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing things basically through
brute force approaches that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genomic and more technical tools have
allowed us to do away with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's rapidly expanded our ability to
breed, make selections when plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings rather than full grown plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just incredible in terms of
the amount of discovery that's happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that when we've spoken in the
past, one of the at least what you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the main reasons that your company
focuses on hemp is because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously the regulations around how much
cannabis you can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there's fewer restrictions on hemp
so you can do sort of these large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you mentioned, some of these genomic
tools that can, you know, maybe reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: your footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have so many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any chance you could be staring
into cannabis instead of hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to answer it coyly, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have an announcement
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are entering the THC breeding space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a little bit of the
final part of the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very, yeah, this is the place
to release it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great conference and,
you know, there's a number of people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are making significant waves in the
industry and we'd love to be able to share
[SPEAKER_01]: that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been in the last three months
some dramatic changes at the federal level
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of policy that with a few LLCs
and some other legal approaches that allow
[SPEAKER_01]: us to basically get into the THC market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really excited to be able to
offer triploids and tetraploid seed
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties for THC growers around the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I guess to kind of go back to
that, and I know it's an issue in the
[SPEAKER_00]: universities as well, where a lot of
universities, they're starting hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, but it is restricted to hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you mentioned, it is pretty much
the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sort of that 0.3 THC
designation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, is there some differences
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are some of these universities kind of
missing out on some, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: potential discoveries because they're only
focused on hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the only thing that makes a
chemical difference in the plant is a
[SPEAKER_01]: single gene on chromosome seven,
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any of the other elements that are on
chromosome seven, we're going to talk a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about that tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could potentially be something that
we're missing out on because there's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of recombination that happens between
the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The universities themselves at this point
have basically, this is the great part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the 2018 Farm Bill, they have been allowed
relatively free rein and it really comes
[SPEAKER_01]: down to their risk assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain universities have been very risk
avoidant and have not gone into more,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say, exhaustive surveys of what's
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other universities have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell is a really good example of that
in my mind, in that they were willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: engage in field trials from 2018 on of any
germplasm that people were willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: submit for industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reality was, they've got a couple
of really good publications out of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: was that there were a lot of people who
were just doing poor breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't understand the underlying
mechanisms that allowed people to grow CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant varieties and still have it be
considered hemp under the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were submitting type two plants
and type one plants in a lot of cases that
[SPEAKER_01]: were eight to 12 to 15% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the moral of the story here is that
the world didn't end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell grew these plants, they assessed
them and they said, hey, farmers need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be aware that people are selling stuff
that will get them put in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a huge public service and should
definitely be applauded, whereas other
[SPEAKER_01]: universities have not gone that route.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in summary, universities are working
with cannabis and it's actually fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't happened in a very long time and
there's great research results coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to mention something that I
read in your abstract and you say that you
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the long standing promise of
the plant in food, fiber, medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and unknown unknowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why do you believe hemp has not
really lived up to its billing as this
[SPEAKER_00]: super crop that can replace all these
other crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it seems like most of the
cultivation has been focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, I think a lot of this
has to do with the history of people
[SPEAKER_01]: making really expansive promises based on
very little data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the research that people were
looking at in terms of grain, looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: super capacitors out of hemp fiber,
great research, really, really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got people thinking that hemp could do
a million different things and it can,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the reality is that the actual
fundamental research that's required to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring those things to fruition hasn't
occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, many of the things
that were over-promised essentially are
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to materialize in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grain and fiber crops are not competitive
economically in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to Canada, China, or France,
other major producers that have been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, it may not
matter because some of the research that's
[SPEAKER_01]: now being done, a great one done at Oregon
State this past year on using industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp grain and fiber as a food source for
animals, for livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to allow small farmers to
feed their animals in a more efficient way
[SPEAKER_01]: based off of a crop that's actually
produced right there in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the way that we need to think
about it should change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than looking at it as some sort of
economic driver that's going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody a billionaire and the world's
going to be driving around hemp-infused
[SPEAKER_01]: cars, we really need to look at the actual
practical applications of what we can do
[SPEAKER_01]: with this plant and how we can leverage
its plasticity to help farmers and other
[SPEAKER_01]: people who can actually use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bright future out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in wrapping up here, I'm curious to get
your thoughts that given that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: this research, although we talked about
the universities are getting back into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still a lot of the research being done
into this plant is by privately funded
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that said, maybe speaking to the
importance of coming to an event like
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed and sharing that information with
the community instead of kind of keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: it close to the vest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously, you've got to keep some
things for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I understand where a lot of
these companies are coming from,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis marketplace, for as much
economic benefit and as much of an impact
[SPEAKER_01]: as it has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most producers are really having a hard
time staying in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suppliers of technical equipment are
having a hard time helping the hemp market
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're having a hard time dealing with
the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just constantly in flux.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we go from there is going to be
largely determined by the way that we deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I personally view data is essentially
like, you know, it's money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that took money to create,
but it's also not something that as
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, we're going to be able to do
anything with when we're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what is the point in supporting
that data and not being able to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: public?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that we find that we may have
questions about when it goes out to
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborators or to the general public,
other scientists, maybe they have an idea
[SPEAKER_01]: about how to fix that or how to do
something more unique with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can come up with all kinds of
ideas, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what other people are able to do with
it that ends up having the lasting legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're more concerned about being able
to push science forward and to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: make this plant more accessible to as many
people as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without getting caught up with money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the unfortunate reality of life
in general, but we're doing whatever we
[SPEAKER_00]: can to get around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Seth, we're glad to have you here at
CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For another year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for joining us in the Coffee
Talk Lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hope you have a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: You as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
All right.
