[SPEAKER_00]: And so it all comes back to this idea of,
I guess, trying to keep impaired drivers
[SPEAKER_00]: off the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and it seems that lawmakers
or law enforcement is really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fixated on finding a biomarker to kind of
determine cannabis impairment,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like a blood alcohol or
breathalyzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your knowledge, are there any
biomarkers that are reliable or that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: close on for determining cannabis
impairment or is that still a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: holy grail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like if you're talking biological,
like in some kind of fluid biomarkers at
[SPEAKER_01]: present, no, we just, we don't really have
anything that's particularly good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the most commonly looked at things are
probably urine, blood and oral fluid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urine is probably the worst of the lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that THC and its metabolites
persist in urine for a really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really long time, particularly among
regular users, you know, comfortably over
[SPEAKER_01]: a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood is not particularly good either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can hang around in blood for extended
periods of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is largely because THC, so it's a
lipophilic molecule, meaning that it likes
[SPEAKER_01]: to get into fat and sort of stay there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it accumulates in people's fat stores
and then just sort of slowly leaches into
[SPEAKER_01]: blood, meaning that it can be there for,
again, weeks and sometimes longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: After use, oral fluid is a tricky matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sort of has some benefits, I guess,
in that it is the matrix that THC leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: most rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take someone who only very
occasionally uses cannabis and administer
[SPEAKER_01]: an acute dose, you probably find that it
persists in oral fluid for a few hours and
[SPEAKER_01]: then dissipates, which is kind of
consistent with impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a number of kind of
significant limitations aside from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the first being that so the
only way that THC can end up in oral fluid
[SPEAKER_01]: is if it enters via direct contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have it smoked or ingested
in some way that it actually contacts the
[SPEAKER_01]: oral fluid, meaning that if you avoid that
contact, say, for example, if the THC is
[SPEAKER_01]: encapsulated, you probably won't have any
THC in oral fluid, which means it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: marker of impairment at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other factor is that there's been
really little research looking at oral
[SPEAKER_01]: fluid THC concentrations in regular
cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what seems to be the case is that
whether THC is present in oral fluid in
[SPEAKER_01]: regular cannabis users is just it's
completely variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's there 12 hours later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's not detected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a little bit all over the
shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the face of it, there are some
advantages to that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you dig a little deeper,
it's sort of a false part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we don't currently have a
particularly good way of identifying
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis impaired drivers.

Thank
