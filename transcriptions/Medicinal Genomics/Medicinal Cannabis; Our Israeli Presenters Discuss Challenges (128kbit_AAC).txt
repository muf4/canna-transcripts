[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that we should know that there
should be a complete separation between
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational cannabis and medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is that in medicinal
cannabis, or people that take cannabis as
[SPEAKER_01]: a drug, or people that do research on
medicinal cannabis, have to know that it
[SPEAKER_01]: has to follow medical regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: A patient should have to know the exact
amount of material he's getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He should know how to get it, and he
should be in constant contact with a
[SPEAKER_01]: physician.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recreational cannabis is a social issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decisions on recreational cannabis have to
be made by society, not necessarily,
[SPEAKER_01]: or not even at all, on medical grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason is that they're two different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should not mix them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should try to move the medical cannabis
as much as possible towards the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons for using a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's happening in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're changing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're changing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that we shall be there within the
next few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a patient who is allowed to get
cannabis for his specific disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: not for any disease, for his specific
disease, whether it's pain, it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: gastrointestinal problem, like Crohn's,
or whether he has anything else that's
[SPEAKER_01]: approved, like epilepsy, for example,
the person or his parents, her parents,
[SPEAKER_01]: should know exactly what mixture he's
getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because cannabis, medical cannabis is a
mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mixture not just of THC and CBD,
but also of a lot of other compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: including some terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a person should know as much as
possible on what is the drug that he's
[SPEAKER_01]: taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started about the recreational use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And often I'm asking the parliament
meetings about our opinion about
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my usual answer is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we are physicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not deal with social decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So recreational use is a social decision
which should be made by the parliament,
[SPEAKER_02]: the government, not by others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not by us, not by physicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: At present, we are working, for example,
on brain trauma.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found many years ago, together with
Professor Esti Shohami, that cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: help in brain trauma in mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit difficult to do brain
trauma experiments in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has been done in mice, and it helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specific compounds, whether they are the
natural ones, the one that we make,
[SPEAKER_01]: the endogenous cannabinoids, or whether
they're THC or cannabidiol from the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these help in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also additional compounds,
surprisingly, which are found in our body,
[SPEAKER_01]: which resemble structurally at least some
of the other compounds I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these compounds also help with brain
trauma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are no drugs in helping with
brain trauma at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume that we can help in this
particular field.
[SPEAKER_02]: 40% of our patients today are oncology
patients, suffering from pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: from metastatic pain, from neuropathy,
and resulted from the treatment with
[SPEAKER_02]: excellent results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'm a little bit confused when I
have to present this.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I presented the results in the
parliament, some of the parliament
[SPEAKER_02]: members, they were so mad at me as a
representative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you allow treatment of cannabis
for every oncology patient in Israel?
[SPEAKER_02]: It cures cannabis, and I have to cool them
a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure it cures, but I'm sure it
helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's symptomatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on, we will see the results of the
new researches, I hope, even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Crohn's disease, which is an IBD,
inflammatory bowel disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was diagnosed four or five years ago,
and I'm currently treated with medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana with some other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my personal experience as a user,
I can't really say for 100% that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: better because of the medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can say that I'm very well balanced
overall, and before I started using
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis, I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a scientific proof,
but that's the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding what my grandfather said,
in medical school, we now learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, especially in the field of pain,
comparing to other pain drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confident that our class of doctors to
be will know more about cannabis and will
[SPEAKER_00]: be more involved in this industry,
which is the biggest problem that
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians have with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they prescribe medical cannabis to a
patient, he can get something that has 25%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and none of all CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is even before he started talking
about the other compounds which are still
[SPEAKER_00]: in research.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say medical cannabis,
what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, that's exactly the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exactly the problem that I'm
facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know, before I double-blind,
before everything else, I need to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm prescribing something to a
patient, that he will get the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is currently not exactly the
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot give a patient just something,
it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis is not a medical term,
just a general term.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should know exactly where we stand,
and we should try to push those that
[SPEAKER_01]: prepare the drugs, the growers or those
that prepare the drugs, to have every
[SPEAKER_01]: single type of preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's an oil, whether it's for
smoking, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The exact amount of at least, at this
point, THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe later other things, but at least
these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because otherwise, we are not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not in medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the way to do it.
This is not the way to do it.
