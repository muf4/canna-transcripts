[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning slash afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me here first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Falling in love with CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for still being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're closing to lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often hear people saying that
nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals are the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower handling fruits compared to
medicine, to drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we talk about the regulation,
we talk about the requirement for the
[SPEAKER_00]: approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do still believe that any good
products, any good cosmetic products,
[SPEAKER_00]: dietary supplement products, should be
supported by science, rigorous research,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with the ones that has
functional claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to use this opportunity to share
with you the research experience we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to share with you the promising
data the excitement I have towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of nutraceutical or
cosmeceutical ingredients based on
[SPEAKER_00]: non-cannabinoid compounds from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the fundamental basic research are
done in the lab, in my lab at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are supported by industry
partners from different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, in addition to that, I also have a
startup, very early stage startup called
[SPEAKER_00]: Ocean State Bioactives, OSB, to further
develop potential cosmetic or
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceutical products with different
natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the past few years, the capacity at
our university for cannabis education and
[SPEAKER_00]: biomedical research has been significantly
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a group of fascinating,
awesome faculty members that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: together on the research of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, I lead a research
unit that is specifically focused on the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential application of natural products
on their nutraceutical and cosmetic
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I take a step back, thinking
that this is not about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about any natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we use our platform?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we rationally design good products?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, comes to me, it always comes from two
angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strategy to develop a natural product
based nutraceutical or cosmeceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient are always coming from two
angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, one is the chemistry,
especially the phyto-constituents of
[SPEAKER_00]: natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is, of course,
their biological activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: For hemp, I feel like this is very
promising, very interesting, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: for dietary supplements and the cosmetic
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the hemp root.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sometimes called waste products from
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that's a pity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it never need to be called as a
waste product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a byproduct from the hemp or cannabis
industry, but it has a great potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: be further developed into nutraceuticals
or cosmeceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example is the spend biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a lot of people, it's just spend waste
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a natural product chemist,
I think that one, the spend hemp material,
[SPEAKER_00]: still has a lot of bioactive compounds
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this is another side project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have extracted a lot of bioactive
compounds from spend hemp material,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially for the phenolics and the
polysaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those polysaccharides are closely
associated with a lot of applications for
[SPEAKER_00]: dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, it has been studied that
polyphenol are good for the gut health,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially as prebiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, we have set up a
library of cannabinoids, and we use those
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids for our bioassets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set up a panel of in-house acid that
could evaluate the natural products in our
[SPEAKER_00]: library.
[SPEAKER_00]: The central of that library, and also for
that bioasset platform, is inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: From inflammation, we can derive to gut
health, we can derive to skin health.
[SPEAKER_00]: For today's talk, I want to spend some
time on the background of our research
[SPEAKER_00]: using CBD as a representative compound
from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to introduce you how we set up our
biological evaluation systems for our
[SPEAKER_00]: further studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the focus for this talk is on
non-cannabinoids type of compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do think CBD could be a very good
chemical probe to study the chemistry and
[SPEAKER_00]: the biological activities of this
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will move to the chemistry study of
the hemp roots and their anti-inflammation
[SPEAKER_00]: activity, as well as their skin protective
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to spend some time on the first
part, introducing you the research we have
[SPEAKER_00]: done on CBD on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is that most of those studies
are published.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go to too much details on the
data, but I want to spend some time on how
[SPEAKER_00]: do we set up those assays?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the rationale behind the
publications?
[SPEAKER_00]: Share with you some of the workflow,
some of the stories behind what you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see from publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step we had was that we set up a
library of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes CBD and a few of those rare,
minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about over 30 different minor
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, we did chemical
modifications and we used synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry to build up another separate
library as the CBD derivatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, many of them are
showing even better biological activities
[SPEAKER_00]: in different applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have studied all kinds of different
biological activities of minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, for us, is kind of like we
understand those compounds better and we
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the bioassay system better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like machine learning, you feed the
machine with data and they can improve,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we are not that fast,
but every time we carry on a study using
[SPEAKER_00]: different natural products, different
cannabinoids in different bioassays,
[SPEAKER_00]: the understanding of those bioassays and
chemistry get profound and profound every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one starting point we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see, initially we test CBD in
a cellular inflammation model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, this is an anti-inflammation
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you a little bit more details
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we pivot it from the monocyte,
the immunocells, towards skin cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we use skin corticocytes as
the cellular model and we kind of shifted
[SPEAKER_00]: from the inflammation stress in the human
monocyte towards the inflammation stress
[SPEAKER_00]: in skin models and especially for
inflammation mediated cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's pyroptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also study another type of cell death
in skin cells, which is ferroptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the full cycle of the development,
the evolution of our bioassays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you some of the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step is set up different
bioassays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bioassays include one
biochemical-based assays, could be
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymatic assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, depends on different outcome or
endpoint, we design cellular-based assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important because it helps us
to understand the mechanics of action of
[SPEAKER_00]: those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, depends on if it is necessary,
we can move to animal-based studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use different animal models for
different diseases models.
[SPEAKER_00]: In parallel to that, I feel very excited
that we also set up a new platform that
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize more advanced technologies such as
proteomics or advanced binding assays to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand better the biological activity
of those compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you heard from the last talk,
Hunter bring a very good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do biological assays,
especially for cell-based assays,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see the statistic, you see the stars,
you know it's working or not if it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: p less than .05.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sometimes it tells you if it's
working or not, but you don't see the
[SPEAKER_00]: information, the dynamic change from the
complexity of the biology behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: values, the p.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we want to utilize more
advanced technology to understand better
[SPEAKER_00]: the mechanism of action of those
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you just heard from Dr. Goldenstein
that multiomics is very rapidly adopted by
[SPEAKER_00]: the field study, the biological activity,
the mechanism of action of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, similarly to metabolomics,
we have a platform approach set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the proteomics to look at the
landscape of the change of proteins from
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, from animal tissues, from human
biological fluid samples to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the impact of those cannabinoids on
specific diseases models.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, we also set up this
binding assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have a specific target from the
proteomics, you want to validate if the
[SPEAKER_00]: compound can actually bind to that
molecular target.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we use a technique called
SPR, surface plasma resonance,
[SPEAKER_00]: to confirm, to validate if the compound
could directly bind to the protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started the anti-inflammation assay
with this model called the inflammasome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is inflammasome and why it's
important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Inflammasome, it's a group of proteins
that could be assembled for the purpose of
[SPEAKER_00]: sensing infection stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the normal status, they are just
proteins, protein group of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the human body sends the stress from
infection, those proteins, they will
[SPEAKER_00]: assemble together and further activate the
downstream protein secretions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, they can activate one protein
called caspase 1, which is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important enzyme that could further
activate the secretion of pro-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokines, such as IL-1-beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that if you throw any natural
products, you more or less see
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammation activity, very general
anti-inflammation activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search a certain natural products
in PubMed, in Google Scholar, you always
[SPEAKER_00]: see it has inflammation activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, inflammation is not a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root of all the diseases are chronic
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that inflammasome is more
pathologically relevant to inflammation,
[SPEAKER_00]: to chronic inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to set up inflammasome specific
model to evaluate our compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the general inflammation assay,
often you do is that you expose the cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: monocytes, macrophages, to the
inflammation stressors, like
[SPEAKER_00]: lipopolysaccharides, LPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you measure the outcome, you measure
the biomarkers, inflammatory biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, in addition to LPS,
we add a secondary signal, which is known
[SPEAKER_00]: as nigericin.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the cells have exposure to LPS,
and nigericin is set up inflammasome
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this model, we can screen the library
of our compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that very interesting that we
screened over 300 different natural
[SPEAKER_00]: products, not only cannabinoids,
many different natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a few of them showing specific
selectivity towards the inhibition of
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammasome.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, CBD is one of those most
promising inhibitor for inflammasome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the details of the
study, which are already published.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into too much, but basically,
at the non-toxic concentration to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, CBD was effectively reduced the
production of IL-1-beta without affecting
[SPEAKER_00]: TNA-alpha.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we can tell it's a very
specific inflammasome inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we want to have more evidence
to support the anti-inflammasome activity
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD, so we further develop different
assays to measure the receptor P2X7,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very important mediator for
inflammasome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that using our different flow
cytometric assays, we can show that CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: could effectively reduce the inflammasome
level in the THP1 cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we move to shift to skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reason is that inflammasome is
actually very pathologically relevant to
[SPEAKER_00]: many of those skin diseases, acne,
and even to aging.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we want to say, if that
inflammasome, the anti-inflammasome
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of CBD could be translated into
skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have is that we have different
bioassets set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say CBD could effectively reduce
the cellular oxidative stress in the skin
[SPEAKER_00]: caroteno site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use gene plex assays to look at a panel
of different genes that are relevant to
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammasome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interestingly, we identified that
caspase-1, the one activated IL-1-beta,
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually identified from this panel,
which was supported by our computational
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, we tested the inhibition
activity of CBD on caspase-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, we used SPR technique to
directly measure the binding affinity
[SPEAKER_00]: between CBD and caspase-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those are published data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caspase-1 is the one that closely mediates
the process of pyroptosis, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation-driven type of cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that skin is more prone to UV
damage, which is closely associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: another newer type of programmed cell
death called pyroptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's pyroptosis?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a programmed cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's majorly mediated by two biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the iron level in the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two is the lipid peroxidation in the
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our assay, we set up this assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expose caroteno site cells to different
inducers, including erastin, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pyroptosis inducer in the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we used this model to screen
a whole library of different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, again, very active.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more minor cannabinoids that
were more promising than CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the data for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could effectively reduce the damage,
the cell damage, from erasting and also
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the two most important biomarkers,
lipid peroxidation and the iron level in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, we used proteomics to take a
look at the landscape of the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: change in this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can understand better what kind of
proteins are involved in this
[SPEAKER_00]: skin-protected effect of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this are published data.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more questions, I would be
more than happy to answer them.
[SPEAKER_00]: After basic research, we still extended it
to application research.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you talk about dietary supplement,
in this case, we measured the stability of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD in GI tract, and we also study the
skin penetration capacity of CBD using
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial membrane-based assays,
including PAMPA, Francis cell diffusion of
[SPEAKER_00]: those bioassays.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, to the next part is the
phytochemical investigation of hemp root.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was very interesting if you read Dr.
Russo's review paper on the cannabis root,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could be a traditional treatment and
also a future treatment for pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very interested in this part of this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I paid a visit to my collaborators in
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually the largest producers in
China for hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I visit them, I see just a massive
amount of hemp root dumped on the side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do nothing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They either burn it or just landfill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, as a natural product chemist,
I feel pity because I know there are so
[SPEAKER_00]: many good compound goodies in this part of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is a phytochemical evaluation
of this part of plant, hemp roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say I'm not going to every
compound that we have isolated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can see apart from few
cannabinoids, there's a large diverse of
[SPEAKER_00]: bioactive compounds in hemp roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemotypes of those compounds are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have phenolic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have triterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have phytosterols.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have fatty acids, but they are often
overlooked in terms of drug development,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they could be very valuable for
nutraceutical or cosmonautical
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some highlight here is that some of
those compounds are actually the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time that has been isolated from hemp or
from hemp roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the chemistry we have done in this
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we further took all of those isolate
into the inflammasone inhibition assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first did a screening assay to see
their general anti-inflammation activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we tested the cannabinoids from the
roots and also the non-cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are showing activity in the
screening assay, testing if they have
[SPEAKER_00]: specific anti-inflammation activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those compounds showing
anti-inflammation activity, which is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid type of compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took one more step further,
although this one has been published,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did one more step of study because
what we have missing is there are so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different possibilities to get the
different type of compounds from hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, here we use different
extraction technology to further look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the biochemistry, the phytochemistry
constituents from hemp roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one we were specifically looking for
accolades from hemp roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting, this is some unpublished
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our preliminary results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have fractionated those extracts from
hemp roots and we further generate the
[SPEAKER_00]: fractions, the extracts that enriched in
accolades.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so far four fractions that has
enriched in accolades.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see their anti-inflammation
activity, three out of the four has very
[SPEAKER_00]: good anti-inflammation activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really triggered us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to go deeper to see what
kind of compounds are responsible for this
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammation activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about the accolades in hemp
roots, you cannot forget about those
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds called cannabinoid sativin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the typical, very representative
compounds from hemp roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their natural abundance in the root is
very tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to isolate those compounds
from the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have enriched a fraction that could
have potentially this type of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the preliminary data, from the NMR,
from the mass spec HPLC, TLC data we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: we suspect that there's one fraction of
those accolades enriched fragments that is
[SPEAKER_00]: enriched in spermidine, which is the type
of those type of compound, spermidine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which also showing very strong
anti-inflammatory activity in our
[SPEAKER_00]: bioassays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal, our aim is to further look at
what are the chemicals in this fraction
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be responsible for this
anti-inflammation activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a new compound or more
representative compounds that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: further used as the standards for the
future development of dietary supplement
[SPEAKER_00]: or nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why the spermidine is, I feel so excited
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many research support that spermidine is a
dietary compound could potentially affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the longevity of human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is supported by different type of
animal models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heavily associated with autophage,
which is also a promising strategy for
[SPEAKER_00]: longevity research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see now there are already many
this type of products you can buy from
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search spermidine type of
supplement, you can find many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I feel pity is that those type of
products more often you don't see the
[SPEAKER_00]: standardization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what exactly the spermidine
type of spermidine compounds are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so lack of research to support
their potential application, their
[SPEAKER_00]: functional claims for those type of
supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's something we can do more
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last part is the skin protective
effect of compounds from hemp roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we go back to this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to isolate alkaloids from hemp
roots, we'll also look at phenolic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to detect this was only a
detectable level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning that the natural abundance of this
compound can flavin is very minor in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to detect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some biological evaluations here
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have here, again, we set up a
cellular model using a human caroteno
[SPEAKER_00]: site, the skin cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We challenge the cells with different
oxidative stressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we extract the protein and analyze
the proteomics to see what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: biomarkers are related to this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a business slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going into the details,
but our bioinformatics, they guide us to
[SPEAKER_00]: work through all of those biomarkers and
the constructed different network to
[SPEAKER_00]: further explore the potential biotarget
and the pathways in this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this large amount of data,
we predict that flavonoids could be an
[SPEAKER_00]: effective compound that could be used to
reduce the damage for the oxidative stress
[SPEAKER_00]: in the skin cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did was that we get chemflavin A
and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We threw them into this cell-based assay
for oxidative stress in the skin cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the biological assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were saying that at the non-toxic
level, chemflavin A and B could both
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively reduce the damage of the cells
from oxidative stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could reduce specific biomarkers that
is related to oxidative stress in the skin
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last part, we also have the mechanistic
study to show that what could be the
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility of those compounds in terms of
reducing oxidation and also reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: glycation in the skin cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part has been published as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thought I want to share with you
is that when we talk about development of
[SPEAKER_00]: a potential nutraceutical or
cosmeceutical, just like pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_00]: CMC is the last barrier for the drug to
get approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard about that from the panel
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar, when you're thinking of
developing a nutraceutical or
[SPEAKER_00]: cosmeceutical ingredient from natural
products, you always need to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: is it feasible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it commercially possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have a lot of strong,
rigorous data to support the function.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, for example, chemflavin A,
we were able to isolate grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemflavin from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This 30 gram chemflavin was isolated from
over 600 pounds of the dry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost impossible you can extract a
fraction from the hemp or from the root
[SPEAKER_00]: and further use that for industrial skill
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't just be feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could be the alternatives that we can
produce this type of compound?
[SPEAKER_00]: As you just heard the presentation before,
synthetic pathway could be one route,
[SPEAKER_00]: could be one option to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, OSB had a collaboration with
contract research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now establish the organic synthesis of
chemflavin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only chemflavin A, chemflavin A,
B, C, and isochemflavin B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to scale it up to gram
quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we scale the production of
those chemflavin in gram quantity which
[SPEAKER_00]: will enable us to do further application
research on the cosmetic or nutraceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we have so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just summarize here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have looked into the chemistry of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have looked into the chemistry of hemp
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a diverse group of bioactive
compounds from hemp roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many potential compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't even discovered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what are they.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they do have the chance to
further be developed into different
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data from the biological assay support
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel this is very promising in terms of
further development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly why I think we should not
rush it into products and sell the
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has to be do more research about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toxicity, safety, safety profile,
application research, formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tons of research we have to
properly do, do it in the right way to
[SPEAKER_00]: support it further application as dietary
supplement or cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I used all the time for the
presentation but I will be here all day
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, feel free to
come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have a discussion with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
