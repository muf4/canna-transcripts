[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, what do we know?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of purpose are they serving?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they helping to carry out certain
processes or what's going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's a fair amount of
literature on these endophytes and
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiomes in other plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like wheat and corn and tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can learn stuff from those
plants because again, with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, I think the earliest studies on
microbiomes was around 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've only been at it for four or five
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly for cannabis or the high THC
strains, this has only been in progress
[SPEAKER_00]: for about a year, a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's relatively new for these two
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other plants, there's these
microbes that sit on the root surface that
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to help absorb nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's others that fight off,
you know, pathogens that might try to gain
[SPEAKER_00]: access to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of these microbes enter into
the roots the beneficials or the
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, some of the ideas are that they
do have some benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, why would they be there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've taken the opposite approach is
that there may be some in there that are
[SPEAKER_00]: not beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those would include pathogens,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That also gain access to the inside of the
root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's probably a battle that goes
on between the good and the bad within the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part we haven't quite figured out
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've done up to now using actually
medicinal genomics platform is to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and sequence these organisms that
are there using, you know, what they call
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genome sequencing where using your
platform, we're able to actually determine
[SPEAKER_00]: what the species of these microbes are
based on their sequences of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've come up with this quite a
large volume of information that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of sorting through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this X?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this Y?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually we'll come up with some
sort of answer to explain what these
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now are you trying to kind of
correlate to the findings that you have in
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbiome with symptoms or morphology
of the plants themselves to try to make
[SPEAKER_01]: some connections there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really hard to do,
you know, because what we're finding is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's no plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no cannabis plant that doesn't
have a microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have a starting point at
zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that we take up already has
a microbiome in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ask the question, well,
if I was to add X and Y, is that going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a difference or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've already got, you know,
A and B sitting in there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes the evaluation of these
new microbes that you add more
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's A and B doing there?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you add, you know,
X and Y, what does A plus B plus X and Y
[SPEAKER_00]: do together?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about two or three recent reports
that show that when you do add X and Y
[SPEAKER_00]: back to whatever is there already,
there is some benefits that they do see
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of an enhancement of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also apparently an increase in
some of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to be sure that it's a
consistent trend that when you add X and Y
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're actually going to see what you
think you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be hard to try to control for all
those different variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't even include the
environment or the cannabis strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using or the fertilizer that you
might be adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that adds a lot of complications to
what we might see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, similar to the microbiome in
our gut, you know, depending on your diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on whether you take in a lot of
yogurt, depending on whether you take
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics, that's going to influence
your microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know yours is different from mine
because our diets are completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of variables that also
apply to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of variables.
