[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Russ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be here and happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to talk with you because I
know that you and your team, you've done a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of work evaluating the use of fueled
portable testing technologies on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, which is pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know from our end on the medicinal
genomic side with some of our testing
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies, that's something the growers
are always interested in, something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: portable, something that's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to talk with you about what
you've found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into the specific types of
instruments you've evaluated, can you set
[SPEAKER_01]: the table, explain the value of portable
testing to cannabis growers and why were
[SPEAKER_01]: you and your team interested in evaluating
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first need was a selfish need as a
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to be able to select across
large populations and the typical GC or
[SPEAKER_00]: HPLC platforms were too expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started trying to find methods that
were more economical to look at a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: plants instead of just 10 or 20 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first interest was selfish to let
us get the genetic gain breeding selection
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then our sponsor noted very quickly,
hey, dispensaries might want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other seed companies might want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can get it good enough on some
of these tools, then law enforcement may
[SPEAKER_00]: want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of an expansion of that
interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys are breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what sort of traits were you looking
for and how was some of these technologies
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in Texas, we're like most people,
you have the 0.3% compliance for
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was our first target tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got lower cost suitcase HPLC
systems in place, which were okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still slow and more than we'd like to
pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interest was trying to improve upon
a couple of other near infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments that are on the market for
that kind of a scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done that, we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try to improve selection for
things of interest more for the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: side, the trichomes in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for us as breeders, we wanted to
look at varying the number of chromosomes
[SPEAKER_00]: in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that with perennial grasses
before working on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with hemp, it has a lot of
value added benefits for fiber and grain
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all three of our instruments we've
developed have interest to our breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think if you're growing hemp
specifically, there is that requirement
[SPEAKER_01]: that it'd be under 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk a little bit about sort of what's at
stake there or how is that enforced?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could people knock at your door and start
testing your plants and you need to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that everything is compliant?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can and they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those tests have ranged anywhere from
the presumptive, the little colorimetric
[SPEAKER_00]: test that law enforcement uses,
which is always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tests will tell you, yes,
this is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, great, we know it's
cannabis, it's hemp.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you go into more diagnostic tests
and we get more precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we abide by those rules set
forth by the state and the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government and the Texas Department of Ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fun thing for us as a breeding
program is if we know it's hemp coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can breed with it, proceed with
generations of selection for other traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: heat tolerance, yield, whatever other
trait we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as we don't test for that
compliance, we can keep going with
[SPEAKER_00]: generations before we ever release
anything as a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we have to do that,
but it lets us streamline our generation
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you're when you're breeding with
it, you don't have to continue to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: verifying that it's hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the parents for hemp, the project,
the progeny may segregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can select the progeny for heat
tolerance, drought tolerance, height,
[SPEAKER_00]: grain size, whatever, and we can proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several generations for a breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we decide to release it as a
cultivar, then we test those descendants
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure they're still compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have to test every single
plant and every single generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, theoretically, though,
if you're if you're starting with hemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're breeding both of them together,
they're not going to suddenly turn into
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's zero point three is a it's a
pretty stringent threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get plants that are low in
THC, but they're still above that zero
[SPEAKER_00]: point three.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be point five point eight or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's happened with material we've
looked at from other regions we brought
[SPEAKER_00]: in, particularly from Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those they're below one percent,
but they're not below zero point three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to find the ones that are and
still that'll that'll change with
[SPEAKER_00]: populations as you work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always a need to test them
before we try to release anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk a bit about the the technologies
that you're using to sort of, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: verify that you're working with hemp,
given that, you know, so much is so much
[SPEAKER_01]: is at stake here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had populations, we know,
that are high and low in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal is to get a bell curve from
zero percent to twenty five percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done the same thing more
recently with the THC looking for bell
[SPEAKER_00]: curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we do that, we do two tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do an HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know we know within that level of
precision what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will do our method of sampling
and sample preparation and our modified
[SPEAKER_00]: optics we use with the near infrared
spectrometer and use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, it's just a matter of
having two data sets and then running the
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics and the calibration and the
modeling and the validation of those
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so near infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that and how is it different from,
you know, HPLC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reflectance, but it's reflecting
light that we cannot see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's a faster wavelength than what
we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this ultraviolet down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infrared is up here above it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the infrared gives us heat
signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it gives us other information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all based on the fact that if you
hit something with that, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: reflect back other other wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's based on the vibration of the
electrons in these molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fun thing is, if you're looking at
cannabis, you can look at particular
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules and they're going to reflect
different amounts of that infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trick is really trying to be as
precise as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's been shown before you can get to
two or three percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accuracy, but that's not all that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal has been to get below one percent
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have you met that goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't we haven't quite reached that
zero point three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're approaching that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, that's it's really the
limitation is we are a breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not a micro fabricator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are certain things with
engineering we can't do in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to reach out to other engineers
to do some fabrication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we can fabricate certain
components to certain levels of precision
[SPEAKER_00]: at that stage, then we can get there,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so that's a that's a good point of
clarification here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you using sort of commercially
available technologies and just sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluating how they work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you developing your own?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the spectrometer we use is a handheld
spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy it off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it ends for off the shelf
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sampling method that we use is
different than what's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're familiar with a little purple
or familiar with the Gemma cert,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are both near infrared devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get you a little bit of information,
but not that accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the spectrometer is off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cool thing is in the future,
your your iPhone 25 is going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: near infrared spectrometer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They demonstrated they could put it on
cell phones back in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the technology is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of putting it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the optics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sampling we do is a bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the optics is different in two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we have our proprietary
little little widget with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optics are different than both of
those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets us be more accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the modeling we do is similar to
what's been done for near infrared for
[SPEAKER_00]: other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use near infrared for forage
evaluation for all sorts of molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the the equations modeling and
validation is similar, but it still ends
[SPEAKER_00]: up being a bit unique for the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I forgot what I was going to ask next.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how difficult are these instruments to
use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, could the average grower conceivably
use this reliably and get repeatable
[SPEAKER_01]: results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I do, I repeat it three times
on every sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do one sample in about 30
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time you run the analysis,
it's still less than a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from sampling to running the optics to
doing the analytics on it, once it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: put together, it's still less than a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you put it all together,
it can be done in one minute or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost a two component system right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of turning a tool from
proof of concept to something that's more
[SPEAKER_00]: ergonomic and user friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the goal is to make it to where anyone
can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now how important is at what stage of
development in the plant you're testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you testing, you know,
finished, dried, cured flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you kind of testing it throughout
its life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets back to, we started testing at
week zero of flowering when, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: before everything comes there and we
started looking at every three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went week zero, one, two,
three, four, and five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, there's not even with HPOC,
there's not a lot of appreciable
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids until about week two of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere between week two and week three,
you start to see it going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal has been to calibrate it
starting in that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything from about week two and a half
until a finished flower, we can sample and
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beautiful point you made was
unlike the Little Purple and Gemiser,
[SPEAKER_00]: which require you to have dried,
cured tissue, which you grind up,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do dried or fresh tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been a beautiful gain for us to do
things out in the field on living plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you mentioned, you know,
this is just one of, I think, three
[SPEAKER_01]: different technologies that you were
evaluating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've moved a lot into microelectronics,
I guess, since we applied to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: participant in this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a Ford device as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on the fiber side, but we'll throw
that fiber device out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first one we started using was
everyone wanted to look at the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty simple to add a small
little microscope attachment onto your
[SPEAKER_00]: cell phone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some of those that can get
up to four or six hundred magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one's been kind of a fun little
freebie, gimme it, or probably open source
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're just combining a cell phone
based microscope, small attachment with
[SPEAKER_00]: image processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So image J or some other version of that
that will do a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will it will identify the round pieces,
the diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll classify the trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it classifies them, it will get the
diameter and the volume that will give you
[SPEAKER_00]: the basic size of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also still in the process,
but working at getting the color of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the pixel color so we can gauge
maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal of that one is just going to
be an open source cell phone attachment
[SPEAKER_00]: and an app where you can use that and look
at your trichome and say, this is how big
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how mature it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a fun open source thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been undergraduates and graduates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third device has been getting back to
the increase in chromosome numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Ploidy, if you think about cells,
if you increase the DNA in those,
[SPEAKER_00]: you increase the amount of protein,
you increase the amount of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's involved with it in plants,
you increase the cell wall size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for fiber hemp, we're very interested
in trying to see if we can make the bast
[SPEAKER_00]: and the herd fiber in particular longer by
extending that cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing the chromosome doubling,
we now have a lot of plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have two sets of chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those we have now confirmed can have
improved fiber and improved grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to do the classification is very
difficult after you hit them with the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment to induce a chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to figure out which ones have
been doubled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants to the visual eye don't look
that different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the typical tool has been used is
called a flow cytometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a capillary system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on cell sorting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for cannabis, which is a resin,
resinous crop, you've got lots of sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: things in that extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put that through these capillaries
and just blocks it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just ruin the capillary systems in
your flow cytometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can't do that, you're left with
your left with looking at chromosomes
[SPEAKER_00]: under a microscope, which is long and
tedious, or trying to use some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: indirect measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're coming up with is not a
capillary system, but a microfluidic
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is eventually going to go nano.
[SPEAKER_00]: But taking the capillary system and making
it smaller, you go to microfluidic
[SPEAKER_00]: channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we do that, we're using these
small flow cells to separate the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fun thing is if it's got four sets
of chromosomes, it moves slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got two sets, it moves faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like HPLC or GC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just flow sorting in that
microfluidic channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have that, it's just a matter
of running them on that fluidic channel
[SPEAKER_00]: and then looking at the speed of movement
of them across that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can estimate whether they have had
the chromosomes doubled or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot there.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing, as someone who has dabbled
with home growing unsuccessfully,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've given up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things I always struggled
with was the thing you mentioned about
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes is looking with that magnifying
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it milky?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it not?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a tool like that I think would be very
valuable, at least for people who are on
[SPEAKER_01]: my level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my goal is to have either a video of
us doing it or actually have something
[SPEAKER_00]: there in hand that we can demonstrate
during the conference and just do live
[SPEAKER_00]: demos if we can't do videos of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that would be the one that we
would bring there with us and have for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to play with and work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be perfect for anyone,
homeowners, dispensary breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: seed companies, those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the tetraploid, which is really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a presenter at our last CanMed,
Seth Crawford, talking about triploid
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics and some of the value that comes
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's three sets, obviously,
and this is four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned some of the advantages
there being better fiber and growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know with with triploid that makes
the plant actually sterile or that it
[SPEAKER_01]: can't reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing for tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or can you actually breathe with those?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have triploid as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess Oregon CBD demonstrated triploid
and others have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically you take the diploid and
double it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have one parent with two sets and
one with four and you cross them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your triploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a beautiful plant for marijuana
or drug types where you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning vegetatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even some of your higher value CBD,
which is kind of questionable if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really going to be cloning propagating CBD
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But triploids are beautiful for those
systems because they're sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like seedless bananas,
seedless watermelons, seedless grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all triploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the same reason, you have sterility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for certain uses, the triploids are
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, it's more interesting to look at
the tetraploids that have four sets
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are fertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get seed off of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen so far you can get larger
grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you say that that technology
would be less useful for your average
[SPEAKER_01]: grower unless they were going to try to
breed for tetraploid specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe most likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess we at our lab, we do some
things for service and we don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: charge much for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've improved the method of chromosome
doubling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could see a time where if people want
to do that, they could send us hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If things change, send us some other seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do the actual treatment of double
chromosomes and confirm it and send you
[SPEAKER_00]: back your tetravoid version of your
favorite strain or your favorite home
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a point where people do it
both steps themselves, but we would have
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell that microfluidic device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a goal is to be able to sell
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But making that simple enough for
homeowners, you raise a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe not so much for home growers,
but maybe your commercial cultivators who
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and maybe that's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk a bit more about some of the
different services and things that you do
[SPEAKER_01]: over there at Texas A&M.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, we do controlled crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have companies sending us seed and
they want us to make specific cross by
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fun thing we've developed that
isn't really part of this abstract,
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis, you really want to control
the males and the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the industry typically tries to put
them in different rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up sacrificing the entire room
for one pollinator, one male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've developed what is called a
pollen control tent, or a pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: containment tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one company in the UK that
makes these, and they're very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've made our own version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the mesh around it lets
enough light through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough air in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's small enough mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less than one micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the pollen from getting in or
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis pollen is about 25% of the
size of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about 25 microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This screen is less than one micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that let us do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put two parents we want to cross in
there, a female and a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other pollen's going to get on that
female except the pollen from the male you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can't leak pollen and contaminate
other plants you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, we have a greenhouse
that's 3,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not using all of it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are currently increasing seed on
120 crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of having 120 rooms,
one for each cross, we now have one
[SPEAKER_00]: modest-sized greenhouse where we're doing
hundreds of individual crosses of
[SPEAKER_00]: different size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we do a single plant and we
inbreed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we do two or three plants for
synthetic hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we do populations in these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been a beautiful tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the male and the female under
110.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fun thing we've learned,
we can make the female endohermaphrodite,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it monaceous, where it has male and
female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to work with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can make a single female plant
pollinate itself so you can breed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've learned more recently,
you can make a male plant produce female
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've started selfing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your crazy wild mind, you might
think of an all-male cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of feminine seed, you might have
masculine seed for fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male plants in general have better fiber
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal is to start doing some of the
inbreeding services that people want us to
[SPEAKER_00]: do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can make crosses for people,
different types of crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: For service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do the chromosome doubling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also a service we have listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, anything that we get
permission to do from the university and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Texas Department of Ag, we can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can provide it as a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, you send us seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get no IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just doing a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give us your seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give you seed back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do whatever you like with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, and you mentioned permission in
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you can only work with hemp,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to get approval from the university
and from the Texas Department of Ag or
[SPEAKER_00]: TDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we do that, any project we propose
and get approved, we've got green lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now what is the limiting factor there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it federal regulation or state?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if Texas were to go full
adult use, would that open things up for
[SPEAKER_01]: you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is the federal regulation holding you
back?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a beautiful question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be above my pay grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be up to the department head or
the dean or the vice chancellor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because actually, the hemp research
license that we have is not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a lowly faculty member.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually signed by our dean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to the comfort level of the
dean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if the state made it legal,
the TDA would give us a research permit if
[SPEAKER_00]: it was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would still be a question of
whether our director and dean would let us
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if we did that, we could do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, our administration has been
very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've not been setting up roadblocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've not been saying we can't do
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just said be compliant and be
careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk a bit about your background
because I was reading your bio before I
[SPEAKER_01]: jumped on with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't start in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk a bit about what you did before
and what made you switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I actually started in biochemistry and
then I went in the army.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went non-traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back from the army and got into
plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I've been a grass breeder,
a perennial grass breeder for over 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I teach classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to always say I was the grass
breeder, but not the grass breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two and a half years ago, Texas green
lighted hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that time, I had learned to use
certain terpenes, some are from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: some are from other plants, that have
helped myself, friends, and families for
[SPEAKER_00]: specific conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a love for terpenes from a
nutraceutical standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to start looking at terpenes as
trying to make plasticizers of fibers to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to work replacing some of these
plastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of jumped into different bio
products as well with the grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I had a job after my PhD turning
grass fiber into ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to not use cornstarch,
but trying to use cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I already had kind of an interest in
the terpenes and an interest in the bio
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fun thing with hemp, when it was
legalized, to me, you can not make one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing or two things, you can make six or
seven things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have six or seven commodities
off of one crop, no one major company or
[SPEAKER_00]: industry can shut you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was working on ethanol,
corn ethanol, they always kept their
[SPEAKER_00]: margin of nickel shorter than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we got ours a little cheaper,
they made theirs even cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one energy company could shut us down.
[SPEAKER_00]: With industrial hemp and cannabis,
no one industry can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got fiber, you've got grain,
you've got terpenes, you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, you got all the bio
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a beautiful crop to use as a bio
refinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's my love for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, with so many different uses,
you need to be able to breed optimally,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you have some experience with
marker assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the traits or markers
that you're interested in or you think
[SPEAKER_01]: could be the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's already markers for male versus
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already markers for CBD and TB.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The markers we're really after for Texas
and the southern US are heat and drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the varieties from Europe and
Colorado just do terrible down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly central Texas and further
south.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be the same going to Florida
all the way across the southern US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really trying to focus on heat
and drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other fun things are going to be
modified trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's an interest in making a
fiber and grain type that has no
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, it would be considered a
type five hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be something that would
make farmers not worry about it being
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make parents not worry about
milk having any residues in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would give the DEA headaches
because they couldn't try to regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be no schedule one molecule in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could argue for a different type of
classification of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing we're after
genetically really is uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at industrial hemp on a big
acreage, the plants are all over the map
[SPEAKER_00]: for flowering, for branching, for size and
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get cannabis to be grown
just like modern corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern major crops where you have
completely 100% inbred line parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can propagate them by seed just like
rice or wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plant the seed, it looks just like the
parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that with cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's all clonely propagated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we have inward lines,
we can cross those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the F1s should be larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's really confirmed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take the risk and see if we
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got several pipelines going to
make inbreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should by this time next year be
able to say, yes, you can inbrede to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fifth or sixth generation to make hybrids
or no, you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be next year's CanMed topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So winding down here, if growers are
listening and they're excited by these
[SPEAKER_01]: different technologies that you're putting
together, are these going to be available
[SPEAKER_01]: to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that process going to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm academia, so I'm way out of industry
for more than a decade now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm very cognizant of trying to get
things pre-commercial or have some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial timeline, particularly for
our sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the three we have listed for
this program, the open source microscope
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at trichomes and classify,
that should be available this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the end of 2023, that'll be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is the NIR platform,
which you've now confirmed with utility
[SPEAKER_00]: for CBD and Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got two of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really up to our sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have the right to commercialize it
as they desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be commercialized at their
timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been disclosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been released to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a matter of how quickly they want to
commercialize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one for the DNA content,
which may have a smaller audience,
[SPEAKER_00]: not as many people wanting to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one may be a little further out,
but it was still either to be this year or
[SPEAKER_00]: next year, 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2023 or 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we want to give us a plug to your
sponsor real quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they introduced me to CanMed and to
Doug and you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the company is Rare Earth Genomics
based out of Texas and Houston.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Ross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before I let you go, I want to give
you a chance to first share any other
[SPEAKER_01]: resources that the listeners might be
interested in if they're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: learning more or reading up on some of the
things that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can always put links into the show
description that they can learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, please plug your program or
you, if you're on social media,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that so that people can
learn more about you and the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: your team's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm old enough, my only social media is
LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But LinkedIn, we do have things we haven't
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a conversion program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking donations and making any
donation of pollen we get into compliant
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and we're going to release that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have a public open
source transplasm collection start to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called the Hemp Conversion
Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's on our LinkedIn or my LinkedIn
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just search LinkedIn for hemp
conversion program, it got a federal grant
[SPEAKER_00]: to help expand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be bigger by next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other products going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they have interest, you know,
if anyone has interest in other ideas or
[SPEAKER_00]: other bioproducts, we're more than happy
to visit and develop those ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again, Russ, for taking the time to
be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to seeing you down in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do as well, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
