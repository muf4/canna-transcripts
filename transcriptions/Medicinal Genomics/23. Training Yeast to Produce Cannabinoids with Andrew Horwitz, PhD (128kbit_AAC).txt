[SPEAKER_01]: On this episode, I had the pleasure of
talking with Dr. Andrew Horowitz,
[SPEAKER_01]: who is the vice president of R&D at
Sestina Bio LLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Previously, Andrew managed the cannabinoid
R&D program at Demetrix, where he helped
[SPEAKER_01]: develop the process for using genetically
modified yeast cells to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We discuss the advantages of using yeast
cells to produce cannabinoids instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and hemp plants, how adjusting
the precursor molecules that are fed to
[SPEAKER_01]: the yeast cells can produce rare and novel
cannabinoids, how cannabis medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers can use this technology to
better understand the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: why understanding the way cannabis plants
produce cannabinoids was essential to
[SPEAKER_01]: developing this technology, and how this
technology is received by the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Andrew, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Demetrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Demetrix is a biotechnology company that
believes in the power of science to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company produces safe, legal,

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now that we've gotten that out of
the way, I hope you enjoy my conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Andrew Horowitz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Andrew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really excited to talk to you with you
today because the topic we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss, which is synthetic biology,
and I guess more specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: using genetically engineered yeast to
create cannabinoids is just a fascinating
[SPEAKER_01]: topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you presented a CanMed 2019 on
that topic, and I've included a link to
[SPEAKER_01]: that video.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the show notes for people to take a
look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got a great response.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited to dig into more
detail around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for those who aren't familiar with
this process, or maybe haven't watched the
[SPEAKER_01]: video yet, I was hoping we could start and
you could use, you could perform a little
[SPEAKER_01]: explain like I'm five, the process of
using yeast to create cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic idea here is that you
obviously cannabinoids are made in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that occurs through a series of
chemical reactions that the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially conducting inside the plant
cells and then in the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those reactions, each step in that
kind of assembly line to build the final
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule is controlled by a protein or an
enzyme that basically manipulates the
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor chemicals into the final
chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of those enzymes is the blueprint for
that assembly line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's encoded by genes in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically the whole idea of biotech
in general, and specifically for using
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast to create cannabinoids is that what
we do is we identify those genes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which is actually quite a difficult
task, but we identify the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get them all together,
you say you've identified the full
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put those genes into a yeast
cell and you say, well, why would you use
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's because yeast are quite easy to
manipulate genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just a ton of knowledge on how
to grow them to really high densities and
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic fermentation tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can just spit out those
cannabinoids that you've put in via that
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're essentially identifying the
genes in the plant and then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: identifying the genes that are in the
plant that are creating these compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: and then genetically engineering them into
yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that accomplished?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that CRISPR or some other technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all sorts of ways to put genes
into yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think CRISPR is the most recent
trick for getting foreign DNA into a
[SPEAKER_00]: microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CRISPR is really powerful,
but there are a number of ways one could
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, essentially, you're
getting the yeast cell to take up a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of foreign DNA and splice it into its own
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that in the CanMed video,
you sort of explained first how the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: creates these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that was really
interesting was that the conversion of CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: to THC and CBDA actually occurs outside of
the cell in the trichome, which was really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't want to steal your thunder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping that you could maybe explain
briefly how the plant creates the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because actually, the way that the plant
does this chemistry, and this is some
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting chemistry, and I'm not
a chemist, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way that the plant does this
chemistry is both fascinating and creates
[SPEAKER_00]: a difficult situation for the genetic
engineer who's trying to do this in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's because in the plant cell,
let me see how far to zoom back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're making cannabinoids,
you basically take two precursor models.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a molecule called CBGA,
which is a molecule that's made up of two
[SPEAKER_00]: different molecules, a levotolic acid and
a molecule called GPP, and fuse them
[SPEAKER_00]: together to make CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBGA, so the A, by the way,
when I'm talking about cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA, THCA, you're hearing that A there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because the natural form in the
plant is an acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that natural form is heated up,
the acid pops off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably many listeners would be
familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, you get the more familiar
THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same for CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG is CBGA without the acid on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick explanation there why I'm
saying A all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBGA is the mother cannabinoid,
and that molecule is produced in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what's really interesting is the
final conversion of CBGA into these better
[SPEAKER_00]: known cannabinoids like THCA or CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That occurs outside of the cell in this
specialized compartment called the
[SPEAKER_00]: tricone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, again, most people have seen
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are beautiful structures in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you look at a bud, a cannabis
bud, you'll see the crystalline kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so trichomes are essentially chemical
reaction chambers where CBGA can be
[SPEAKER_00]: converted by enzymes called synthases,
cannabinoid synthases, into THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be by the action of the THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA synthase or CBDA by the CBDA
synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two major synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that there's other synthases
out there like the CBCA synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the major ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this reaction is occurring outside of
the cell, which is somewhat unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what poses really a big
challenge for the yeast engineer who's
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make cannabinoids inside a yeast
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you can imagine, the situation
in a tricone outside of the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: different pH, oily, is very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: than the situation inside a yeast cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting those enzymes that are used to
working in the tricone to work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast cell, I think represents one of the
biggest challenges for making cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: by biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there two separate processes here?
[SPEAKER_01]: First, it's creating that mother
cannabinoid CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then is there sort of a second strain
of yeast that's sort of doing the synthase
[SPEAKER_01]: process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that probably most people would
try to do it in the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have a great point there,
which is it's kind of like two very
[SPEAKER_00]: different skill sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making CBGA, which happens inside the
yeast cell and draws on these two
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor molecules, the lipidotolic acid
and GPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's almost an entirely separate
challenge to then convert that CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that folks have contemplated
doing these things in separate steps,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're really looking for,
you need to kind of need an athlete that's
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplished in two entirely different
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's an insightful way to say
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think ideally for a fine
economically feasible process,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would be getting it all done in one
strain would do the full conversion of
[SPEAKER_00]: production of CBGA and conversion into the
final THCA or CBDA product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is that the reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the reality right now or is that
the goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think of what you're seeing right now
is a lot of the press releases I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out from companies in the biotech
cannabinoids field have been about CBGA
[SPEAKER_00]: and about CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBG is a really interesting molecule,
I think, with a lot of terrific
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, something I would say is that
genetic engineering difficulty does not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily correlate with the value of
the molecule on a biological basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean is that it's more
straightforward to make CBGA than it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: make THCA or CBDA, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBGA is a great target for biotech as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that there's been
increasing awareness of how CBGA and the
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylated form CBG have a number of
very interesting effects that overlap in
[SPEAKER_00]: part with some of the profile of CBD,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess, and I'm sure I'm answering
your question, exactly there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that CBGA is a great first
target for the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that pulling that all the way
through to CBDA and THCA is absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more work.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm understanding what you're
saying, are you saying that we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: there yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we able to create THCA and CBDA
through this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's something that's
important to stress is that when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing strain engineering, to make biotech
molecules, there's a number of phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the phase where you don't even
know what all the genes in the pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say, for example, if you go back to
the early days of Demetrius, Demetrius was
[SPEAKER_00]: founded based on technology coming out of
Jay Keasling's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jay and his team had discovered a
missing enzyme in the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are the initial things,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have the minimum number of
enzymes to make the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can detect the product,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like tiny, vanishingly small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're making more and more of
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point, you're making so much
of the product and you've scaled it up
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's economically feasible and you
can go to market with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my point there about CBG was just
that CBG, because it is a step on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway towards CBD and THC and the other
called terminal cannabinoids there,
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that I think the biotech
companies are able to hit first because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a partial pathway, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely a number of groups have
shown that THC and CBDA can be made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, CBG is definitely a
cannabinoid that's on a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_01]: radars, I know, especially on the
cultivation side, trying to create plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that are CBG rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that comes with its own
challenges of trying to find knockouts in
[SPEAKER_01]: the synthase genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's a good place to kind of
step back a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was wondering if you could comment
on how does this approach of creating
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, what are the advantages to
it over traditional cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that where biotech makes a lot
of sense is when you're talking about rare
[SPEAKER_00]: natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what I've said for a while,
I live in California that getting high is
[SPEAKER_00]: a solved problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the, in California for
sure, I think a lot of the interest here
[SPEAKER_00]: is in these more, we'll call them the
minor cannabinoids, things like CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just over a hundred of these
compounds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know so little about most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think where biotech really shines and
where I think that it could really add
[SPEAKER_00]: something is going after those more minor
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been some amazing feats of
plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not in that area at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different type of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know much about, to be honest,
but attending CanMed in 2019 and listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to some of these talks, it's clear that
plant breeders are able to do some pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing things, get to plants that make
some pretty rare compounds in amounts I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have thought possible,
but it's still very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when you look at the varins,
for example, you're basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get high level varin production in a
plant, you would need to kind of shift the
[SPEAKER_00]: balance of fatty acid production in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things, again, anything's
possible, but it strikes me as pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult because a plant's sole purpose
is not just to produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It obviously has to support roots and
leaves and growth and all sorts of other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage of the yeast cell in
biotech is that we can re-engineer the
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast cell pretty radically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a single cell organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really just exists to produce more
yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can redirect that energy and do
things like re-engineer central metabolism
[SPEAKER_00]: in ways that let us really focus on
specific rare cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to the extent that you're trying to
purify some rare cannabinoid out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of plants, get biomass away from
other very similar cannabinoids that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want, that's much less of an issue
in yeast where we can essentially put in a
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific pathway that gets you from
point A to point B, which is your rare
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid, and have that be a single or
predominant product that's secreted from
[SPEAKER_00]: the yeast cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the advantage over
agriculture, there's all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, predictability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the product profile that you're going
to get coming out of the yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation, which is occurring inside a
stainless steel tank, is going to be much
[SPEAKER_00]: more consistent than what you're going to
see out of a grow operation, even an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor grow operation in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still dealing with whole plants and
you have less control over the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the time, it takes about,
I would say, one to three weeks to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: biotech fermentation process to make
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take three months to grow
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at the end, I talked a little bit
about the purification, trying to purify
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds out of a big plant mess versus
out of wholesale fermentation broth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a cleaner product coming out with
biotech most often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to think if I've hit everything
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think the other really,
really cool thing, and I talked about this
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit at CanMed in 2019,
is that there's this flexibility and
[SPEAKER_00]: optionality of the fermentation platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the technology that Jake Kiesling
described in his lab's paper on production
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoids in yeast and that
Demetrius carried on was the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed these kind of precursor molecules,
the fatty acids, into the yeast cell and
[SPEAKER_00]: have them be incorporated into the
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that allows you to build a single
strain and then produce either,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, CBD or CBDV.
[SPEAKER_00]: The varins with different length tails on
these molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can really just customize that in
a modular fashion by feeding different
[SPEAKER_00]: fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, in an unorganized way,
covers some of the advantages of biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of precision, purity,
speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things that are particularly
important when you're going after these
[SPEAKER_00]: very rare cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think that last point that you
were talking about was particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole idea of introducing different
precursors to the yeast and then kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to not really mix and match,
but like you said, to customize different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you could speak a
little bit more to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it possible to essentially create
cannabinoids that we haven't yet seen
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally occurring in the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's an example of
that in Jay's paper as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the paper, they use what's
called precursor feeding to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: features on the molecule that don't exist
in nature and would set that cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: up for further modification through things
like click chemistry where you could
[SPEAKER_00]: create libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's known as the semi-synthetic
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make new to nature cannabinoids in
yeast via feeding fatty acid precursors
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't exist in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yeast cell sees these and just says,
great, and incorporates them into the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway, pulls them into the pathway,
puts them in the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you feed hexanoic acid,
which is the kind of canonical version of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fatty acid, then you get CBD or THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start feeding other fatty
acids, you can change the chain length and
[SPEAKER_00]: get these other forms, both natural and
unnatural.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to imagine researchers on the
medical side or the healthcare provider
[SPEAKER_01]: side or maybe even kind of before that
sort of the basic kind of drug development
[SPEAKER_01]: side must be very interested in exploring
that and be very interested in getting
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of mass quantities of these rare
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's one of the value
propositions of biotech is the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of provide samples of these rare and
new to nature cannabinoids for further
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that when you think about
there's, I guess, a couple of FDA approved
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs in the cannabinoid family,
basically, maybe more than that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but roughly speaking, THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got Marinol and Epidiolex,
and then there's some other variants of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question that I kind of struggled
with is why aren't there more of these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're so bioactive, they're
largely nontoxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really interesting set of chemical
matter that seems underexploited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think part of the reason
structural, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very difficult to do research on
cannabinoids for a long time in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another piece of it is access,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an academic researcher trying to
get a hold of these rare cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're present in vanishingly
small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chemical synthesis to get to these
things is very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very expensive to produce them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, yeah, I think that one of
the really exciting aspects of biotech
[SPEAKER_00]: protection of cannabinoids, the synthetic
biology approach, is the ability to get
[SPEAKER_00]: access to researchers so we can start to
really better understand what the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: applications for this rich family of
compounds could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I have to ask, too, I have to ask
about the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the researchers I've spoken to,
healthcare professionals, they're very,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say it's unanimous,
but a majority favor the sort of whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant medicine with the idea of there
being different cannabinoid concentrations
[SPEAKER_01]: or even terpenes that are kind of
contributing to the medicinal effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can this process sort of help them
mimic the entourage effect if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be doing some research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the entourage effect is
really interesting because I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been hard to get solid data on it just
because you're, again, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the reasons why most drugs that are
approved by the FDA are single molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: is because it's easy to understand then
exactly what the causal agent is,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think when you talk about the
entourage effect, it gets very complicated
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that something biotech
could do could be produce a palette of
[SPEAKER_00]: individual compounds that could be blended
in ways that would allow people to test
[SPEAKER_00]: these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the entourage effect the same in one
strain produced in one place as it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: another strain in another place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some really interesting talks at the
2019 CanMed where people were looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: very fine differences between compositions
of cannabis and seeing very different
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, it's really hard to tell
what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal opinion is that the cannabis
plant did not evolve to get as high or to
[SPEAKER_00]: cure diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of these things, the cannabis
plant wants to make more cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guess is that most of the
bioactivity of cannabis comes from a very
[SPEAKER_00]: few number of compounds, most of which are
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you absolutely can't rule out the
potential for synergistic effects for
[SPEAKER_00]: polypharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a multi-faceted problem
and it's becoming more and more apparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more I talk to people in different
sectors of this industry, from a testing
[SPEAKER_01]: side, there's challenges in even
identifying these different compounds in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the healthcare side, there's
challenges in getting a consistent product
[SPEAKER_01]: to really do solid research on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think something like this would solve
some of those problems at least to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to create something that's more consistent
or to be able to tinker with the various
[SPEAKER_01]: levels to really dial in the effect that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I think that there's always
going to be all sorts of, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously many, many applications for
cannabinoids and many types of users of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's always going to be
people that want to interact directly with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, that even going to growing
their own and curing and all these things
[SPEAKER_00]: and the story of where the plant was grown
and how it was grown and all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be people that are
just interested in the single pure
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's going to be a wide
range of users and a wide range of desires
[SPEAKER_00]: for what they're interacting with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sometimes in this industry,
there are sort of two competing camps of
[SPEAKER_01]: the single molecule versus the whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that there's room for both
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kind of wanted to ask you about
that, kind of being a part of synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: biology or kind of creating cannabinoids
through a non-traditional means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has there been any sort of pushback from
the industry, from the more traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: folks that you've experienced?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, actually, I was I was a little
concerned about that going to speak at
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed, you know, that there might be some
folks who were angry about the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: biotech getting involved and, you know,
genetically modified and all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found people were largely people
were pretty open minded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're largely, you know, interested in
the science behind it and the access.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely had some conversations where
there was concern about I would say two
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, one about, you know, genetic
engineering in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I'm usually able to convince
people that all of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural strains we're talking about
today are products of extreme genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant, there were there were no
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I read somewhere that even since
the 80s, the content of THC in top strains
[SPEAKER_00]: has doubled or tripled or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all the result of genetic
engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it by breeding or you can do it
with CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all genetic engineering in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically creating organisms with
extraordinary capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one piece, the genetically
modified piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the CanMed audience was
actually pretty sophisticated on that one
[SPEAKER_00]: and understood how it fit into the general
artificial selection and breeding as one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these many tools to achieve these
extraordinary capabilities in an organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the second piece, I think,
is the one the idea that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: big biotech is going to put the growers
out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, again, I think that that's
pretty unlikely just because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to be a market for the plant
and for interacting with the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, you've got,
you know, companies that want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: formulating these compounds into their
products that are looking for a really
[SPEAKER_00]: pure, dependable, steady stream of product
and aren't going to move forward without
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that, you know,
what I would say is that it's a big market
[SPEAKER_00]: that's only going to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not like a zero sum game or
where you cut a piece of the pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming from someone else's slice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's actually a case where the
number of applications is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase because of biotech and you're
always going to have growing.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to ask you about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked a lot about cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an application for using biotech
to generate terpenes or are they sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a common compound that's not
really applicable?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because most of my career in
industrial bio has been centered on
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started out working at Amaris,
a company called Amaris that's also in the
[SPEAKER_00]: biotech cannabinoids game at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I left before they got into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Amaris was founded around the concept
of producing terpenes and yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've now made, you know,
at least a dozen different terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: scaled them up to a multi-ton scale
through fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cannabinoid pathway itself,
that GPP molecule I was talking about that
[SPEAKER_00]: gets put together with a livatolic acid to
make CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: GPP is the precursor to terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabinoid molecule itself is
what's known as a mariterpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then, of course, you're talking
about the terpenes in the plant that give
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor and the sensory experience of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, also have been cited
in the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great targets for biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I would say that mastering
terpene production in yeast was kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary precursor to making cannabinoids
in yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the common refrains in these
conversations that I'm having with people
[SPEAKER_01]: in the industry is that there are still
things, still a lot of things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to ask you, are there things
that we still don't know about how the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant creates cannabinoids that would be
valuable information for biotech?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it were, you know, like I was
saying, it was only maybe four years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: or so that the full genetic pathway was
described with the discovery of this
[SPEAKER_00]: missing enzyme by the Keasling lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not like we've known about
this for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've had the genome sequence of
the plant for – I'm going to probably get
[SPEAKER_00]: this wrong, but I would say about a decade
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had a full pathway for about
four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd say we're at the very beginning of
understanding how the plant works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, while I think we can
describe exactly how to make THCA or CBDA
[SPEAKER_00]: or the variant of those, the varian
variants of those, you start getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: the more rare cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not totally clear, at least to
me, you know, if – how those are made by
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, whether they represent
chemical breakdown products of molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: that we know how they're made in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that's the case for some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whether there's, you know, a whole slew
of different enzymes that are acting on
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGA and other molecules to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: A ton to learn from the plant still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always happy to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, winding down here, I did just want to
give you an opportunity to let the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience know where they can learn more
about what we've talked about,
[SPEAKER_01]: more about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The floor is yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think that, you know, in terms of
understanding biotech cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the company I was formerly with,
Demetrix, has put out a really excellent
[SPEAKER_00]: series of blog posts kind of trying to
break down the science for the popular
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I know they've got a few on CBGA,
CBG, you know, the science and the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, that's a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would check out the Demetrix website and
try to learn more about what they're up
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think that's a great starting point
on the biotech side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if someone wants to really get
deep into it and maybe has a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a background, I would read Jake
Heasling's paper from 2018 on the biotech
[SPEAKER_00]: production of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an excellent one, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, personally, I left Demetrix about
middle of this last year in 2020 entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: for a personal opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the chance to do another startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when I joined Demetrix, I was,
I think, the fourth employee there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was no lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to build everything from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that early phase where you're
going from zero production to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, that first step is an
infinite increase, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's really exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like building out an early R&D team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, about the middle of last
year, I got the opportunity to do that at
[SPEAKER_00]: a new company that's called Cistina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cistina is also in the industrial,
well, in the synthetic biology space,
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to Demetrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what's really interesting about
Cistina is that we're focused on kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: miniaturizing the R&D process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a lot of the discovery and work in R&D
is done in what are called 96 well plates,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are kind of like 96 tiny flasks that
you can grow cells in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Cistina is doing is that they're
trying to move away from those plates,
[SPEAKER_00]: which physically take up a lot of space
and limit the number of variants of these
[SPEAKER_00]: strains you're building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look at and move into single
cell technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, now instead of having cells
growing in 96 well plates, you have cells
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of droplets or single cells,
and there's a number of ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's one piece of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other piece of it is that we're
partnered with a company called Inscripta,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has made this gene editing box
called the Onyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Onyx allows for this, you know,
massively multi-parallel genome editing
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can basically redesign entire
genomes in microbes like yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, it's really powerful and allows us
to get really deep into the biology that
[SPEAKER_00]: influences the production of these biotech
target molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, those two things I think
were really exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I jumped at the opportunity to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're at this point, you know,
running a screening operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab is up and going and having a great
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will certainly put links to the
resources that you mentioned into the show
[SPEAKER_01]: description.

definitely check that out.
