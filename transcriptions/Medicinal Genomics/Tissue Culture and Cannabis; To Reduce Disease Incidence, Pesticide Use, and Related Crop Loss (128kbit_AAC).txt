[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you all for attending this
afternoon and excited to talk to you about
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a pretty relevant topic after
the talk that we just saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been a really exciting couple of days
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say a special thanks to
Medicinal Genomics and their team for
[SPEAKER_01]: putting this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent a lot of time here with
different folks and really enjoyed a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the presentations, so really honored to
be here and see the advancements in
[SPEAKER_01]: science around cannabis that we're making
collectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick background on myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a PhD organic chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spent about 15 years in molecular
diagnostics, human diagnostics,
[SPEAKER_01]: working on early detection of cancer,
heart disease, and building assay
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies and platforms to support
clinical trial submissions for drug
[SPEAKER_01]: discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spent a couple of years in food safety as
well, working on pathogen detection
[SPEAKER_01]: platforms, things like salmonella,
listeria, and E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the move into agriculture about
three and a half years ago to start Front
[SPEAKER_01]: Range Biosciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been very fortunate in that time to
assemble a world-class team of folks that
[SPEAKER_01]: have probably collectively over 100 years
of experience in commercial agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: agronomy, tissue culture, some of the
things we'll talk about today,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what I'm going to talk about here
represents really their collective
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge and some of the work that
they're doing for us at Front Range
[SPEAKER_01]: Biosciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: A quick background on the company,
just to give you a little bit of context
[SPEAKER_01]: for why I'm up here and talking to you
about this topic today is there's two
[SPEAKER_01]: parts to our business.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is our Clean Stock Nursery
Program, which is where we use tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture to produce clean, healthy,
disease-free plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We push them out to growers in a
production setting to support their
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and production efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part of our business is on the
varietal development side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a plant breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're combining traditional plant breeding
with methods like next-generation
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing and new technologies to improve
the process and hopefully develop new
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that help farmers realize better
yields, improvements in their crops that
[SPEAKER_01]: they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two crops that we currently work
with, really three.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with cannabis, including both
industrial hemp as well as the high THC
[SPEAKER_01]: version or marijuana, and we also work in
coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I'm going to be focused on cannabis
and tissue culture properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have facilities in Colorado for hemp
and Wisconsin for hemp, and then in
[SPEAKER_01]: California is where we do our work in
marijuana and coffee propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why are we all here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to admit, realizing my slide is
about eight months old and Jeffrey's slide
[SPEAKER_01]: or Dr. Raeber's slide earlier,
I need to update my numbers here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's evidently over 1,000 unique
small molecules in this plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's why we think it's the world's
next commodity crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also got a lot of potential as a
functional food and nutritional value,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like polyunsaturated fatty acids
that are balanced pretty much ideally for
[SPEAKER_01]: human consumption between omega-6s and
omega-3s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a great protein source with the
hemp grain, and then lastly there's fibers
[SPEAKER_01]: for industrial use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a pretty amazing crop,
and it's going to take the collective work
[SPEAKER_01]: of a lot of us in this room to help scale
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big challenges in a new crop,
and it came to every crop before this one,
[SPEAKER_01]: was that the supply chain is just not
consistent yet, and it's going to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of time and resource and effort to get
it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like every other crop,
we need materials and inputs that are high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, high volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: We obviously need plants that are clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just heard a little bit about some of
the challenges with disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticides are another big issue,
and we also need it to be uniform,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, to support manufacturing
applications and efficient production
[SPEAKER_01]: processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, due to prohibition,
most cannabis growers and most cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and whatever part of the supply
chain you're in, you just haven't had
[SPEAKER_01]: access to a lot of these technologies,
and so we're all scrambling right now to
[SPEAKER_01]: build them to bring together a supply
chain to meet the incredible demand that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing around the world now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dig into the cannabis supply
chain for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I'm going to really talk about the
nursery and how tissue culture can be used
[SPEAKER_01]: to help support the supply chain from the
very beginning, which is at the nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at the total supply chain,
the genetics or the varieties that go into
[SPEAKER_01]: the nursery, and then those plants go into
production farmers, and then they go to
[SPEAKER_01]: extractors and processors and then
manufacturers and all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: different pieces, the nursery is really at
the beginning, and so what I'm hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do today is talk about ways that
you can potentially build a strong
[SPEAKER_01]: foundation for the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at a traditional cannabis
nursery, this is typically what you would
[SPEAKER_01]: see, and a lot of this resulted from
prohibition and people being forced to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in warehouses and garages and
clandestine spaces, and so what you see is
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's all vegetative propagation,
there's mother plants that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: maintained often for decades, and during
those decades you're simply building up a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge pathogen load, whether it's pests,
whether it's some of the molds and mildews
[SPEAKER_01]: that we just saw a lot of amazing pictures
of, they're going to simply find their way
[SPEAKER_01]: into your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that you see in
traditional nurseries is they're typically
[SPEAKER_01]: right in the production space,
so you typically see them in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, same location, and if you look
to other crops and other large
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural companies that produce
specialty or high value crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: their nurseries are always separate from
their production facilities, and there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: reason for that, it's so that you can
minimize your risk of catastrophic loss
[SPEAKER_01]: due to an infection that might take out
your entire crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is you build up an insect
and pathogen load over time, and as you
[SPEAKER_01]: try to scale up your production efforts,
you're really limited in how quickly you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do it, because you might try to get to
five, 10, 15,000 plants, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat manageable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try going to 100,000 or a million plants
or even several million plants under
[SPEAKER_01]: management and cultivation, and trying to
keep these pests and pathogens at bay
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this really sets the stage for
something that's come to many other crops
[SPEAKER_01]: before this one, and that's virus and
outbreaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the same pests that infect
other crops infect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thrips, aphids, mites, they're all
carrying, or they're all considered
[SPEAKER_01]: vectors for lots of different viruses,
and as you begin to scale up a crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: your risk of virus outbreak goes up
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing in people,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The more people travel around,
the more we get things like flu virus
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading, it's the same for plants,
and so we're gonna see that risk continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow as more and more folks come into
the industry, more and more markets come
[SPEAKER_01]: online, and people are moving plants,
seed, product, all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, some of these go
undetected, they can lie dormant,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can rear their ugly heads when a
plant gets stressed, there's lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: different things, and honestly,
a lot of it's still unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is viruses and outbreaks
will lead to regulatory changes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which can sometimes cripple companies in
the short term as they have to face strict
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations on how they can move their
plants around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've listed a few crops, whether it's
fruit, berries, cassava, potato,
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar cane, they've all had their tough
times with things like virus, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll certainly see this happen in
cannabis at some point too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an example from blueberries,
so blueberries really exploded over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last 20 years with a lot of demand on the
consumer side, and what you saw as you
[SPEAKER_01]: spread blueberry plants around and started
growing them in different regions
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the Northwest and the Midwest
is there were viral outbreaks,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of them were pretty devastating,
and it cost farmers a lot of time and
[SPEAKER_01]: money, and then it eventually led to
regulatory changes, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: phytosanitary standards to move plants
across state lines, and other regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: to try and mitigate this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's over 900 viruses known to infect
plants, so far there's, to my knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: and once again, this industry is advancing
so fast, as I mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we think there's two right now that
are known to infect cannabis or hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically a mosaic and a streak virus,
but there's a few others that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: thought to be implicated in infecting this
plant that I've listed up here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the reality is though, and we test for
a lot of these as part of our Clean Stock
[SPEAKER_01]: program, but the reality is there's still
a lot of work to do in the pathology area
[SPEAKER_01]: for this crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really fully understands which
viruses are infecting and how do we test
[SPEAKER_01]: for them effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sample preparation in molecular
diagnostics is always a big challenge,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when you introduce a new sample
matrix, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: a new crop, you know, there's certainly
going to be challenges there, and so we
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't seen a lot of positive IDs,
but I don't know that that's because of
[SPEAKER_01]: them not actually being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it also could be a limitation of
some of the testing technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is viruses are carried by
pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there's no federal
registration for a lot of pesticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in this crop in particular,
because of the way it gets consumed
[SPEAKER_01]: directly and smoked, there's a very large
risk for many pesticides to the consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it's really important, and we're
already starting to see recalls that
[SPEAKER_01]: growers aren't using these pesticides on
their products, and especially if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting distilled and concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick shot of a study done by Steep Hill
Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was actually last year now
where they tested a bunch of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: saw that over 80% of it was contaminated
with some type of pesticide that's
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibited, and you know, this is a big
red flag, and I think a lot of companies
[SPEAKER_01]: have been addressing this over the last
six months, but it gives you a sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: the scale of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers are also demanding this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want contaminants, any of it,
on their products, whether they're
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming them for food or for recreation
or medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is a trend that's been
going on for a decade, and I don't expect
[SPEAKER_01]: it to change any time soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: As people become more aware and the
internet reaches many more people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're going to demand that you
have clean products.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we solve this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, quality systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can look to other industries like
pharma, molecular diagnostics,
[SPEAKER_01]: food safety, and there's a lot of quality
systems that have already been developed
[SPEAKER_01]: to try and support clean manufacturing,
clean production of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've listed a few here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good manufacturing practice is one that
really comes out of pharma, and it's tough
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's hard to actually implement,
but a lot of companies are trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me excited to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a great way to ensure
quality in your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: HACCP is another one that's used in food
safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody knows probably about
ISO, which is about standards for like
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing environments, and you know,
what I encourage people to do in their
[SPEAKER_01]: companies is, you know, work on this
internally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, put together documentation
packages, SOPs, batch records,
[SPEAKER_01]: quality assurance, quality control
systems, make sure your products are
[SPEAKER_01]: traceable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these are all really key things
as we try to scale the supply chain and
[SPEAKER_01]: minimize our risk both for your company as
well as for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, make sure that you're,
you know, spending a lot of time on
[SPEAKER_01]: personnel training, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only as good as your employees,
and so if they're not well trained and
[SPEAKER_01]: versed in some of these things,
then it's going to be hard to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: quality supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tissue culture, clean stock nursery
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to dig into that for a minute
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just some examples from our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows some plants and tissue culture on
one side and then in the greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_01]: our clean stock nursery on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of advantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk a little bit about that and then
some of the work that goes into setting up
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if used properly, it can help mitigate
your risk, and it can mitigate your risk
[SPEAKER_01]: of catastrophic crop loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you combine a clean stock type program,
with a strong integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: program, you can actually minimize your
need for any pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make sure that the product you're
putting out at the end is clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've laid out some benefits and some
considerations for tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a lot of interest in this topic,
and it's been a pretty hot topic in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, certainly some of the things
that I've been talking about here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll dig into, catastrophic crop loss
risk mitigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really important, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean material that's disease free,
pesticide free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows you to store your stock plants
much more effectively and in a cleaner,
[SPEAKER_01]: safer environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also allows you to deploy new genetics
very, very quickly as you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, ship these clean plants to new
locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we've started to
see, and I'm not going to present any data
[SPEAKER_01]: on this, hopefully for maybe next year,
is we're seeing improved vigor in some
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that have been cloned for a long
time that go through the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a win for the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also helps satisfy phytosanitary
standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of considerations here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people that I talk to,
everybody wants to build their own tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to discourage them from
doing that, but you know, you should go
[SPEAKER_01]: into it with eyes wide open.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of costs associated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very resource and labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot longer than most people
realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of tissue culture has been used in
research settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's certainly valuable there,
but to use it in a production setting is a
[SPEAKER_01]: very different beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is whether you're in
tissue culture or the greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors, there's the risk of off types.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can mutate at any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you always have to control for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So building a quality system that allows
you to check for true to type and that
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants that you're putting out,
whether they're for you or for a partner
[SPEAKER_01]: or your customer, that they're meeting
specifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last is there's a lot of work to do
around pathogen testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already talked a little bit about
that, but you know, evaluating what
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens need to be screened for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last, it's a new crop for tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at some other crops,
it's taken years, sometimes even close to
[SPEAKER_01]: a decade, to build strong tissue culture
production systems and clean stock
[SPEAKER_01]: standards that help a crop in an industry
thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big problem that we see in tissue
culture is cannabis diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if some of you got to see Dr. Jonathan
Page's talk yesterday, I'm signing a paper
[SPEAKER_01]: of theirs here, but you know, there's a
huge amount of diversity in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, we're starting to
understand it thanks to a lot of work
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, folks in this room and
around the world are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're working on some of that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a collective effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is right now, it's still
very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we see is that in tissue
culture, some of them don't respond as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really a lot of work to do to
better characterize our genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quick, bacterial contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first part of tissue culture
process is to clean out all of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you just saw in the previous
presentation, which infect your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be on the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's just a few examples from our lab of
some of the things we've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these bacteria can come out,
like I said, either from the surface or
[SPEAKER_01]: internal to the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungal contamination is another big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of the first part of tissue
culture is to clean these out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take them through multiple
iterations of multiplication and cleanup
[SPEAKER_01]: through the initiation process to
eventually get rid of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, then you can start up your
production arm and start releasing clean
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can take, you know, six to nine
months to get through this process to get
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of all of these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get through it, though,
you take it into a rooting stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You develop healthy roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get it ready for production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a couple examples from our lab
of some clean, healthy plants that have
[SPEAKER_01]: made it through the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a strong, healthy root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're ready to go into the next
stage, which would be acclimatization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another example of some really,
you know, good, healthy specimens from our
[SPEAKER_01]: lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give you a sense of what cannabis
tissue culture should look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see nice, green, healthy,
vigorous plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are going to go out and produce
very, you know, very quality plants for
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last, we'll just finish up with some
pictures from the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are from some of our hemp customers
in one of our field trials that we ran
[SPEAKER_01]: this year with some of our plants that
came out of the hemp tissue culture lab
[SPEAKER_01]: and our greenhouse nursery in Lafayette.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is what we're all
trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is obviously outdoor and hemp
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could show you a similar picture
from the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the goal for all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll finish up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email address is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to reach out to me directly,
feel free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stick around afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we've got a really great panel
coming up with a few other folks on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation side that I'm going to get to
join here in about 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have a quick 30 seconds if
somebody wants to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 seconds, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering with the tissue samples or
the producing that way, can you produce
[SPEAKER_00]: from a nice seed as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we have a seed breeding program
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be releasing some seed this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you can certainly produce really
quality plants out of seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some advantages and disadvantages,
which I'll try to get to in the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're going to run out of time
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be happy to talk with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's reasons for both, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
