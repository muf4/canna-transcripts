[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone, I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Akeem Gardner, those lights are bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, May is ALS Awareness Month,
so I'm very excited to be able to be here
[SPEAKER_00]: to present on what we're doing in regards
to ALS research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to challenge all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know the ice bucket challenge,
go home, do the ice bucket challenge,
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge your peers to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are continuing along with the ALS
Association to raise money for ALS
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very well needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now today, I'm going to try something a
little bit different, a little bit new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start by asking a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have any of you guys watched the movie
Oppenheimer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Learned the story of the atomic bomb,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was a very, very good movie,
a powerful and compelling story.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that blew me away,
no pun intended, but it blew me away the
[SPEAKER_00]: striking power of nature when combined
with modern science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as that film aimed to bring to
light a pivotal moment in history,
[SPEAKER_00]: today I aim to draw a similar parallel,
but in the realm of medical science to
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end, my aim is to convince you that
complex human disease are best solved with
[SPEAKER_00]: the complex but beautifully designed power
of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not nature as a destroyer, but nature as a
giver of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, I'm excited to share with you
this story of how I think we get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start to quickly recap, our mission
at Cronerda is to develop therapeutics
[SPEAKER_00]: that target inflammation and address unmet
needs in neurology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're using the synergy of cutting
edge science and proprietary natural
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients to do just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last three years, we've been
exploring uncharted plant molecules and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a lot of work to validate them
pre-clinically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our team is young, talented, and gritty
and driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're such a joy for me to work with
each and every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a science advisory board
experienced and proven in botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to target inflammation,
the root cause of all disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: because 50% of human mortality is
attributed to systematic chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most drugs on the market and the ones
that still fail in development still have
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty bad safety concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And botanicals, though generally regarded
as safe, have efficacy, standardization,
[SPEAKER_00]: and patentability issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the prevalence of disease continues
to rise, we at Cronerda see an opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to challenge the traditional drug
development and treatment paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Canflavins A and B are two of our
star molecules that help us do just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two are penylated flavonoids unique
to cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a flavone backbone consisting of
two phenyl rings and a heterocyclic ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're highly lipophilic, and that allows
them to easily accumulate in cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially membrane-brown enzymes and
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're traditionally found extremely
scarce and rare in the plant in under
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.014% of the plant's biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've developed production
technology, patented tech, that allows us
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to produce these as extracts
alongside purified molecules that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been able to use to gain deeper
understanding of their mechanisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they work against inflammatory and
neurodegenerative targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm gonna start by laying the
groundwork of how these molecules might be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial in areas of neurodegenerative
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canflavins A is a dual inhibitor of
pro-inflammatory enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has 30 times the potency of ASA,
the active ingredient in aspirin,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't have COX-1 activity as it
works through five below, so a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: safety profile is expected with repeated
and chronic use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, though this initial discovery was
made in vitro in the mid-1980s,
[SPEAKER_00]: no one's produced enough of this molecule
to be able to validate the original assays
[SPEAKER_00]: with botanically-derived ingredients,
as we have here, or they haven't moved
[SPEAKER_00]: things forward in vivo, not in a human or
in a mouse until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we were able to do was do an
LPS-induced acute respiratory distress
[SPEAKER_00]: model that was able to show that Canflavin
A was able to reduce cytokine storm
[SPEAKER_00]: markers and ameliorate the pulmonary
function in a statistically significant
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other data not shown on the slide,
but it shows that we were able to decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: MPO activity, which is a measure of
inflammation, and a reduction in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokine known as CXCl1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notably, while dexamethasone, I think we
can see it here, and this one is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, dexamethasone was failed to
improve the respiratory dysfunction,
[SPEAKER_00]: improved by LPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Canflavin A successfully restored the
respiratory function in these mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we continued to look at how these
molecules could help, and what we used
[SPEAKER_00]: here was C.
[SPEAKER_00]: elegans in a model due to their genetic
and behavioral suitability for simulating
[SPEAKER_00]: human neurological conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these studies, compounds were tested at
a concentration of 20 micromolar,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Endeavorome serving as the positive
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 10 experiments, three that I'm gonna
show you today, our Canflavins exhibited
[SPEAKER_00]: significant activity, especially in models
related to ALS and frontal temporal
[SPEAKER_00]: dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggested to us a valuable direction
for future research into their potential
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what brought us to ALS,
otherwise known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any of you not familiar, ALS is a rare
and rehabilitating motor neuron disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: with rapid progression and average
mortality coming just two years after
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's currently no cure and or
treatments to manage symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the disease is very complex,
with a multifactorial nature of neuron
[SPEAKER_00]: degeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a need for new treatments to meet
the unmet needs of patients, as every 90
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, someone in the US is newly
diagnosed with ALS, and every 90 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone with ALS passes away from the
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to understate just how much of a
challenge this disease is, and how much of
[SPEAKER_00]: a challenge it's been to modern science,
as it's completely heterogeneous,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning it manifests differently in each
patient, and it's governed by a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of genetic, environmental,
and biological factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different things going
wrong in the motor neurons once they start
[SPEAKER_00]: to degenerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disease also exists on a spectrum with
other diseases like FTD and Parkinson's,
[SPEAKER_00]: so symptoms are often misdiagnosed,
leading to a challenge when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional drug therapies are often
designed to target a singular pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these continue to fall short in
effectively treating the multifaceted
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one would think, with our new
technology and our new ways of making
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines today, over a 150-year history
of this disease, we would have some
[SPEAKER_00]: traction towards a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nope, life expectancy back then was
two years post-diagnosis, and it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: the same today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the options that we have on the market
today are no good, as patients are left
[SPEAKER_00]: with the options of taking multiple drugs,
multiple pills, various solutions to help
[SPEAKER_00]: them manage a rehabilitating quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in today's news, we still continue to
see failure after failure after failure in
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently with Amalex voluntarily
withdrawing their medicine due to a
[SPEAKER_00]: failure after phase three clinical trials,
even though both the analysts and the
[SPEAKER_00]: company thought that this could be a
blockbuster drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, patients were let down and
disappointed after promising phase two
[SPEAKER_00]: data because it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just top of the news over the
last 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of failures from a lot of
pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this has led to industry experts
calling for change in how we approach ALS
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just one disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to treat the illness in multiple
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone in the room here with us had a
similar calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had been talking about it for many of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was Dr. Ethan Russo, our senior
medical advisor and CEO of CredoScience,
[SPEAKER_00]: where part of his business is formulating
novel botanicals that could be developed
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutically.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years ago, Ethan began to tell me a
story of a patient that he had first
[SPEAKER_00]: treated when he came to practice diagnosed
with this terminal disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this patient refused to be treated
with the traditional pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: His choice of therapy was cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Ethan will tell you, over 10 years
of seeing this patient, he never got
[SPEAKER_00]: weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also told me of his personal mission to
do something here for this patient
[SPEAKER_00]: population as he too felt the pain of
watching a loved one pass away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Ethan and I started to talk,
this is where things started to change for
[SPEAKER_00]: me, as Ethan let me know about a patented
formulation he had been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout his career that he knew would
be able to serve this patient population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that I needed to catch
up on was learning the full potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis plant, one of nature's
greatest medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to ALS, it's important to
note that there's much anecdotal evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: reported of the plant's utility,
as patients suffering from both ALS and
[SPEAKER_00]: other neurodegenerative diseases have used
it in various forms since antiquity to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing I had to learn was all
the advantages of the botanical drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are multi-target therapies that are
made up of well tolerated ingredients that
[SPEAKER_00]: we as humans co-evolved with in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be delivered in a uniform
product, and as many of you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are streamlined advantages in
developing botanical drugs, with
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators around the world recognizing
the long history of traditional use that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have for these medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, patients, they generally
prefer naturally derived medicines
[SPEAKER_00]: anyways, versus the synthetically derived
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all lean towards the laws of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for me, as a law school graduate,
I love that I get to lean on the
[SPEAKER_00]: historical evidence of proof of cannabis's
utility in human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in 2700 BCE, Emperor Shenian wrote
that protracted taking may make one fat,
[SPEAKER_00]: may make you, will make you strong,
but you'll never go see now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1200 CE, writings from the Anaconda
shared that in combination with celibacy,
[SPEAKER_00]: those who used cannabis as part of a
rigorous regime could live 300 years free
[SPEAKER_00]: from any disease and signs of old age.
[SPEAKER_00]: May be worth it, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the ninth century, Al-Kindi
famously wrote, hashish eases the muscles
[SPEAKER_00]: of the limbs and what flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now more recently, the bioactive molecules
from the plant have been pharmaceutically
[SPEAKER_00]: developed and standardized to treat
neurological diseases like multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: cirrhosis and Dravet syndrome with
commercial success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And researchers have long investigated how
the key constituents from the plant may be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful for helping patients suffering from
ALS.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these studies was a randomized
control clinical trials of nebiximals,
[SPEAKER_00]: trade name Sativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 patients in the study, 29 took
nebiximals, all of them looking to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: their spasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, not only was the drug tolerable,
but patients showed statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant improvement when compared to
placebo at two of their endpoints,
[SPEAKER_00]: the modified Ashworth scale for spasticity
and on the pain numeric rating scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the trial wasn't powered strong enough
to show statistical significance on all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other secondaries, including the ALS
functional rating scale revised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though some of these findings were
statistically significant and some were
[SPEAKER_00]: not, what's key here is that Sativex was
not optimized for the ALS patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exactly what we have the ability
to do with CNR-401.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our botanically derived cocktail
mixture specifically designed to harness
[SPEAKER_00]: the powers of nature standardized in a way
that will meet the requirements of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators like the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like a nuclear bomb doesn't rely
on a singular reaction, but a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneous reactions that amplify each
other to produce a massive synergistic
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, 401 isn't just us throwing
together a bunch of ingredients in a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: or an extract and hoping that one works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a calculated strategy where each
component plays a specific role enhancing
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall drug's effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of this approach lies in its
synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each ingredient in the cocktail is
selected not only for its individual
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, but how it interacts with each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crucial because in ALS,
where multiple cellular and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways are impaired, what we have the
ability to do is to provide benefit by
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting multiple pathways simultaneously
leading to a therapy that will create a
[SPEAKER_00]: cascade of beneficial effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitigating the disease from several angles
with each and every dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know all this sounds nice,
but some may ask, where's the proof?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the other ingredients?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know this approach will work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now I'm gonna take you through a
little bit about what the last few months
[SPEAKER_00]: have looked like for us and where we
intend to go from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So several toxic agents such as BPA,
BMAA, pesticides, and heavy metals are
[SPEAKER_00]: known to try to trigger symptoms similar
to ALS.
[SPEAKER_00]: BMAA, in particular, is produced by a
symbiotic cyanobacteria and has been
[SPEAKER_00]: linked to ALS, Parkinson's, and dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This compound has been found in the food
supply chain in Guam and detected in the
[SPEAKER_00]: brains of individuals as well as American
Alzheimer patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And BMAA is suspected of causing neuron
damage by promoting excessive glutamate
[SPEAKER_00]: excitotoxicity, which has propelled its
study as a significant environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factor in ALS research across various
preclinical models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now zebrafish are increasingly recognized
as a preferred model for preclinical drug
[SPEAKER_00]: research, particularly in the study of
neurodegenerative diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've partnered with CREMCO Labs,
a CRO with specializing in zebrafish
[SPEAKER_00]: studies to conduct an assay involving
neurotoxicity induced by BMAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this study, first we had to establish
the toxicity parameters for BMAA using
[SPEAKER_00]: zebrafish larvae, and then we validated
the study using Endeverone, a therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: drug for ALS known to restore motor
function, ensuring the relevance and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reliability of our findings in the context
of ALS research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our objective in this overall project is
to develop a botanical drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna be a product composed of
plant extracts that meet our targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we finalized the chemistry
manufacturing controls for this
[SPEAKER_00]: investigational product that we'll put
into human clinical trials, we used
[SPEAKER_00]: botanically derived isolates at optimal
ratios to ensure that in these initial
[SPEAKER_00]: tests, we were able to assess the overall
target activity of our formulation just
[SPEAKER_00]: for these studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these materials, we then had to make
sure that they actually worked in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we determined was that an addition
of 10 millimolar of cyclodextrin solution
[SPEAKER_00]: was safe and non-toxic as a carrier for
dissolving the ALS formulation into the
[SPEAKER_00]: test medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our toxicity assays conducted six days
post-treatment confirmed that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: products that we were using were safe up
to a final concentration of two
[SPEAKER_00]: micromolar, and they all stayed in the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we were able to do all this,
it was time for our experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our findings were able to show us that our
CNR 401 and some of our other products
[SPEAKER_00]: were able to demonstrate a statistically
significant effect in this model,
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating the promising therapeutic
effect that we have for potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: treating ALS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treatment with our 401 in the zebrafish
larvae led to a statistically significant
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement in the BMAA-induced phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to the positive control
Endeavoron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these experiments were conducted in 48
well plates with six to nine experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: performed per condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we knew we had our hit, then we
wanted to test the efficacy of our
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation across various doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a couple more experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: These assays were performed in 48 well
plates with seven replicates involving
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 60 larvae for each formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results showed a dose-dependent
response for both CNR 401A and 402A are
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed and pure formulations respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next what we're doing is we're
progressing our formulations and
[SPEAKER_00]: development research initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our current efforts are guided by the
botanical drug development standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: which need us to refine our extraction
SOPs, enhance our product fingerprinting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask us to adhere to rigorous QA,
QC, and QC procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of our drug delivery,
we're focusing on optimizing our
[SPEAKER_00]: investigational product formats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our pharmacokinetic studies are
particularly concentrated on enhancing the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood-brain barrier penetration using
things like solid lip and nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, we're also embarking on a
study of our investigational product in a
[SPEAKER_00]: canine degenerative myelopathy study at
the University of Montreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a naturally occurring animal model
that mimics ALS and has various
[SPEAKER_00]: similarities because these dogs also carry
the SOD1 mutant gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also working to better understand
the multi-target modes of actions of our
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation and what that has on ALS
progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we're looking at is
investigating the potential role of
[SPEAKER_00]: canflavins on modulating calcium levels in
the brain and addressing impaired
[SPEAKER_00]: glutamate uptake by astrocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hallmark of neurodegenerative
diseases like ALS, so we're very
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in what we're gonna find there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also doing some biomarker discovery,
including RNA sequencing from our previous
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments to gain insight into gene
regulation and biomarker analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're using bioinformatics screens
from people on our team to enrich patient
[SPEAKER_00]: data profiles and predict outcomes by
integrating existing data records for
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory like ANSR-ALS and other
information so that we can identify
[SPEAKER_00]: biological pathways for intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the targets that we're really
interested in is the bitter taste
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors, and we're gonna talk more on
this at our later presentations later in
[SPEAKER_00]: the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also preparing and raising money to
go into a pivotal phase two trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're putting our team and our
infrastructure together, targeting our
[SPEAKER_00]: first patient dose sometime in the first
nine months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a strong understanding of the
roadmap in front of us, with a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerated approval obtainable and orphan
drug designation, protecting our
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial advantages as we continue to
grow and develop out this asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our patents are filed globally and give
exclusivity to our methods, our
[SPEAKER_00]: compositions, and our products over the
next 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond CNR 401, we also have multiple
other assets in development that follow
[SPEAKER_00]: closely behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond this, we have numerous
molecules in discovery, some of them that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been characterized, some of them that
are yet to, that as we learn more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: about, and learn more and more about their
therapeutic potential, we're extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about what we can bring to the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as Oppenheimer and his team
orchestrated the reactions to change the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of history, today we're aiming to
coordinate a therapy that can
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamentally change the trajectory of
those living with ALS, its treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and its care.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't just an addition to our arsenal
against ALS, it's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: transformational solution that will
resonate across the spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurodegenerative diseases, bringing new
hope where there were previously very
[SPEAKER_00]: little.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we dive deeper into our work and we
roll up our sleeves and get ready for the
[SPEAKER_00]: real work to begin, I invite any of you
who that may be able to help in any way
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to join our team, our story,
which is a tale of groundbreaking science,
[SPEAKER_00]: complex challenges, and the profound
impact of natural innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the moment we seek to emulate in
our journey towards a breakthrough ALS
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment and a world without complex
degenerative terminal illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to our
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A special shout out to our Connerter
research team all of our service
[SPEAKER_00]: providers, our partners, and the
government of Canada for providing funds
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were able to use to do this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a couple of minutes so if we
have any questions, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can find me, oh, question to
Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably proprietary, but any chance
to give us a hint as to what cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: or non-cannabinoid compounds you're
focused on?
[SPEAKER_00]: As Ethan spoke about yesterday,
we have a variety of different ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: in our mixture that we know that do
various things that help with the ALS
[SPEAKER_00]: pathophysiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at Ethan's presentation
yesterday, you got a sneak peek or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: bother Ethan later to find out about his
trade secrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Akeem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious about the results of the
zebrafish model and I forget what drug it
[SPEAKER_01]: was that was the standard you were
comparing against, which obviously did not
[SPEAKER_01]: translate to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious about your thoughts on the
translational potential there and the
[SPEAKER_01]: results of your compound versus that drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, Endeavorone is a solution
right now that's used for ALS treat ALS
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's approved as an IV formulation,
but it only minimally extends lifespan,
[SPEAKER_00]: about two to five months, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know it works at restoring motor
functions, but what it doesn't do is over
[SPEAKER_00]: a series of time is stop the disease
progression and help the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know is that with cannabinoids,
our ingredients in our mixtures will be
[SPEAKER_00]: safe for chronic use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a variety of different
information on the various cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and flavonoids that we have in
