epilepsy while at GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed24, Ethan will present
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: unraveling the Gordian knot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during our conversation, we discuss
what is CHS and who does it affect,
[SPEAKER_00]: why cases of CHS appear to be on the rise,
possible genetic markers that could
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate CHS susceptibility, steps
cannabis users can take to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: developing CHS, why some people in the
cannabis community don't believe CHS is a
[SPEAKER_00]: real thing, and much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Ethan, I want to thank this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Cannabis Nurses Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Established in 2015, the Cannabis Nurses
Network is a professional nursing and
[SPEAKER_00]: professional development organization for
nurses around the globe.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I just want to say that we
are excited to have you back for CanMed24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are so grateful that you continue
to participate in the event each year and
[SPEAKER_00]: serve on our advisory board, Processing
Abstracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you're also going to be a
part of the medical practicum this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with Bonnie Goldstein and Dustin
Sulak and Eloise Thiessen, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: already an all-star lineup, but you're
adding to that, which is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just thanks again for being such a big
part of CanMed over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't do it without you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that a lot of people attend
each year just to have the chance to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: from you and connect with you at the meals
and the networking events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're happy to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we are going to talk about
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you will be presenting about at
CanMed24 in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an important topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a controversial topic in some ways
and appears to be a growing problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into all of that,
I'm sure there are some people watching or
[SPEAKER_00]: listening who aren't familiar with CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you give us a rundown?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a condition that was first
published in 2004 in Australia based on
[SPEAKER_02]: several cases with an index case going
back to 1996.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what's interesting is usually when
something's reported for the first time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a real evolution of the
description.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they nailed it pretty much from
the start.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they were describing was a
situation in which chronic cannabis users
[SPEAKER_02]: developed a syndrome in which they had
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: often cyclic, that seemingly was relieved
by hot water bathing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the patients involved would
spend hours in the tub or the shower to
[SPEAKER_02]: try and relieve symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this gradually has become more
frequent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either ascertainment has improved or what
many of us think is that it's become more
[SPEAKER_02]: prevalent over time with the greater
prevalence of high potency cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this seems mainly tied to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we should point out that it's really
an issue with any CB1, cannabinoid 1
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor agonists, because the problem has
also been described in people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: using some of the synthetic the high
potency synthetic CB1 agonists in total
[SPEAKER_02]: absence of cannabis usage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There've been other people that thought or
would like to attribute this to pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: exposure, but certainly people get this
even with organically grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like it or not, cannabis is the
culprit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these bouts with vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I understand it, this isn't just
sort of like an acute response where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you kind of have one episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going on for quite some time,
hours, sometimes days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's an important distinction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone can get sick from cannabis if they
have exposure all of a sudden to too high
[SPEAKER_02]: a THC level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think many people have had the
experience of using a vape for the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time or having an edible that was too
powerful and actually getting sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of counterintuitive to people
because everybody knows that you use
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, at least in low dosages,
to treat nausea and vomiting associated
[SPEAKER_02]: with chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't make sense to people that
you can have this reaction that seems
[SPEAKER_02]: illogical.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's very consistent with what we
know about cannabinoids, that they have
[SPEAKER_02]: what's called a biphasic dose response
curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now to break that down, it means that a
lot of the cannabinoids will have one
[SPEAKER_02]: activity at a low dose and an opposite
activity at a much higher dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that explains how people can get
sick from THC acutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's quite different from CHS,
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that is a subacute or chronic
problem where people will have these
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing bouts of attacks of nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, they go on until they
abstain.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we'll get into, there are treatments
for it, but they're a little different
[SPEAKER_02]: than what we'd expect as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you describe sort of this cyclic
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a condition, cyclic vomiting
syndrome, which has a lot of similarities
[SPEAKER_00]: to CHS, yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't like to think that they're
similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a really distinct diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cyclic vomiting syndrome is something
that usually appears in children.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what will happen is, with no apparent
reason, a child will develop nausea and
[SPEAKER_02]: vomiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what's interesting about this is it
seems to be what's called a form frust,
[SPEAKER_02]: frustrated form of migraine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are people that go on
subsequently to develop more classic
[SPEAKER_02]: migraine symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And almost invariably, there is a family
history of migraine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this responds to prophylactic treatment
for migraine.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my career as a pediatric neurologist,
I actually treated a six-month-old.
[SPEAKER_02]: His pediatrician was sharp enough to
realize that we've got these episodic
[SPEAKER_02]: vomiting situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: A strong family history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it be cyclic vomiting?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used a benign drug called
Cyproheptadine just at night in a low
[SPEAKER_02]: dose, and the problem disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was sort of a confirmation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing is there can be some
overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a situation in which older people
who continue with the cyclic vomiting
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms benefit from cannabis because
cannabis helps with migraine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the non-discerning clinician that's
not asking the right questions,
[SPEAKER_02]: these two conditions can get confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other point I'd like to make about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: In cyclic vomiting syndrome, there has
been a mutation that has been noted in the
[SPEAKER_02]: CB1 receptor gene, which is something we
did not find in the CHS patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least on the sample that we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a diagnostic distinction
between the two syndromes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and you mentioned that some physicians
may incorrectly diagnose CHS as CVS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you alluded to it earlier that
this could be the reason why we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: cases of CHS get larger as more clinicians
are sort of becoming aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that one of the reasons why it's
climbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I think you already
addressed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my question was going to be,
how many cases are we seeing now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how has that kind of grown?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are wildly divergent estimates.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a gastroenterology survey of
some kind, and they estimated that
[SPEAKER_02]: nationally in the US, there were probably
350,000 people that had this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another study with really
questionable methodology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was done in Bellevue Hospital in New
York City.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they talked to people who did not come
in for CHS, asked them about their
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis usage and whether they ever took
hot showers to reduce nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on that, they made an estimate
of two and a half million people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: US, as if New York City was somehow
representative of the country at large.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there are a lot of people
that are affected like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The true figure is probably somewhere in
between, but we honestly don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something we want to study
more closely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're currently putting together a
consortium of people in different
[SPEAKER_02]: disciplines to try and mount a bigger
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's very hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly, we know who's at risk,
and this would be people who are using a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, in our survey, which is the
biggest to date of over 500 people,
[SPEAKER_02]: the average usage in the folks with a
diagnosis of CHS was four grams a day of
[SPEAKER_02]: herbal material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a mixed thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people smoked, some vaporized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mainly, it was smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And almost exclusively of high THC
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is this getting more frequent?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we need to consider various factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: One I alluded to earlier, and that was it
for sure is the case that the availability
[SPEAKER_02]: of high THC potency material has increased
nationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that certainly is a factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other is there is an increasing
recognition of CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may be more readily diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, there is an over
diagnosis possibility because we've heard
[SPEAKER_02]: of many cases in which someone comes in to
the emergency room and they've got nausea
[SPEAKER_02]: and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is asked, do you use
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the answer is yes, they're pegged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably inappropriately is having this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That again is bad medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a byproduct of the pressure that
physicians are under to see everybody in
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 minutes or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're lucky to get somebody to touch you
these days because of an over reliance on
[SPEAKER_02]: technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, another topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to sort of the heavy usage
and kind of defining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said four grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that like the actual weight of the
cannabis or is that like the actual like
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were going to have it be milligrams
of THC, like it's four thousand milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: We could break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, the whole thing of the
bioavailability, you know, we know that a
[SPEAKER_02]: gram of cannabis, if it were 20 percent
THC, it doesn't people aren't getting 200
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams of THC when they smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fraction of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably more like 30 milligrams,
which is still plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I guess an interesting
question is, is there a threshold amount?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This begins clearly not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it varies from person to person.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one pattern is that this often will
develop after a period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you don't necessarily get
it the first time you get involved with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it follows some period of
escalation of dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a particular risk with vape
patents with their high potency,
[SPEAKER_02]: because even users admit that they're
often using more to chase a certain level
[SPEAKER_02]: of high that they desire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that places people at risk,
clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are no sure cutoffs,
you know, a point below which you're OK
[SPEAKER_02]: and above which you're at risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that cut and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just more likely that you get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that stood out to me,
too, is that at least in the survey that
[SPEAKER_00]: you had, the vast majority of folks were
inhaling cannabis, whether smoking or
[SPEAKER_00]: doing vaporization, do we also see
symptoms or see CHS emerge from edibles?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you sure can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, when it gets into the
brain, it doesn't discern whether it was
[SPEAKER_02]: got there through the digestive tract or
the respiratory tract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's more likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: much more likely with smoking because
that's what typically people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, with smoking, you get a very
rapid upward peak on the dose response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas with oral administration,
it's a slower onset.
[SPEAKER_02]: So smoking clearly, it's more likely to
produce ups and downs that lead to
[SPEAKER_02]: repetitive dosing that will lead to
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: More readily, but people should not think
that they're immune from susceptibility to
[SPEAKER_02]: this by eating cannabis products.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now wondering if you can kind of
explain what we think is sort of going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, I'm not a scientist,
I'm not a physician, but there is mention
[SPEAKER_00]: of down regulation of the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So explain that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the way your receptors work,
is if they're getting too much input,
[SPEAKER_02]: they will involute, sort of fold back in
or become inactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if there's too much of that,
it means that you actually will be
[SPEAKER_02]: deficient in endocannabinoid function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's one theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem, we know that this happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been demonstrated through animal
work that if you keep exposing the animal
[SPEAKER_02]: to high amounts of THC, or CB1 agonists,
that their receptors are going to reduce
[SPEAKER_02]: in number or become inactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this is not something that's
easily studied in humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, you know, for instance,
you could look at endocannabinoid levels
[SPEAKER_02]: in the serum, but that doesn't necessarily
tell you what's going on in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, that's very hard to study
because the endocannabinoids in the blood
[SPEAKER_02]: are extremely unstable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blood sample has to be immediately put
under liquid nitrogen and gotten to a
[SPEAKER_02]: specialty lab, and it's just not commonly
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, there's the possibility of
using positron emission tomography on
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely expensive and not widely
available tests to assess receptor
[SPEAKER_02]: function in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, this hasn't been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been done on CHS, and it's really
embryonic at this stage in terms of its
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, you could try to look at
anandamide or two AG levels in the spinal
[SPEAKER_02]: fluid by doing a lumbar puncture,
spinal tap, but that's not something you
[SPEAKER_02]: do on everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so right now that's theoretical.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we can tell now, you know,
so between 2004 and the present,
[SPEAKER_02]: there wasn't a lot of explanation of what
CHS was from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there have been, again, studies that
showed that marked upregulation of the
[SPEAKER_02]: hypothalamic pituitary system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically stress responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in pain and you're nauseated and
vomiting, you got stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, this is really serious stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't, you know, simple situation of
vomiting a couple of times because of a
[SPEAKER_02]: virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: People lose weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get marked abnormalities,
sometimes of electrolytes, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the mineral balance in the blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there've actually been two deaths
attributed to this because of how bad the
[SPEAKER_02]: vomiting was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there are certain markers,
but until recently, we didn't have an
[SPEAKER_02]: explanation for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does one person get it and another one
doesn't?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the reason we wanted to examine
it with a hypothesis that perhaps certain
[SPEAKER_02]: people have a genetic susceptibility to
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we wanted to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with Endocanna Health, we put together
a study starting with a survey,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, of over 500 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, for entry as a CHS patient,
we had very strict criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't want there to be mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first thing was they had to carry a
diagnosis of CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, somebody had seen them and
said that this wasn't what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then additionally, they had to have active
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't want people in that may have
been misdiagnosed as having CHS,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're okay now.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, they didn't really have
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that whittled things down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it down to something like 200
candidates and they were offered genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: testing, which is done with a swab in the
mouth to look at the DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, there was a lot of
attrition between step two and step three,
[SPEAKER_02]: because only 28 CHS confirmed CHS patients
returned the kit after all of them had
[SPEAKER_02]: said that they wanted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason for that was we had a great
deal of pushback from the CHS online
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were people that questioned our
motives, thought we were in this for the
[SPEAKER_02]: money, didn't like our methodology for one
reason or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was an active movement to
tell people not to participate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that wasn't helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we needed to compare them to
somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were some people who took the
survey that were high volume cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: users.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, about the same four grams a
day who didn't have CHS symptoms and
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have a diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those were the comparison groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we found was a little surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first hypothesis was, well,
there's gotta be a problem with the CB1
[SPEAKER_02]: gene, the gene that codes for the CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: As mentioned previously, you do see that
in cyclic vomiting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instantly we had a difference between
the two syndromes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also hypothesized two other things,
that it could be a problem with the
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolism of THC, how it's broken down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did get confirmation of that because
there was a statistically significant
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in a mutation in a CYP2C9 gene
between the CHS patients and the heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: usage of cannabis that didn't have
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CYP2C9 is the enzyme in the liver that
breaks down THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might understand if there were a
mutation there, perhaps that it wasn't as
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient in breaking down THC,
that levels would be higher and this could
[SPEAKER_02]: produce this funny reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third hypothesis that we had was that
there would be an issue with the TRPV1,
[SPEAKER_02]: TRPV1 gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought of that because one of the
interesting things about CHS is that hot
[SPEAKER_02]: water exposure seems to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly, something else that's
hot, application of capsaicin ointment on
[SPEAKER_02]: the skin, the active ingredient in
children, chili peppers also temporarily
[SPEAKER_02]: relieve symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That turned out to be the case too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we saw a statistically significant
difference in the number of mutations seen
[SPEAKER_02]: in the CHS patients in the TRPV1 gene as
compared to the high volume cannabis users
[SPEAKER_02]: without CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then there were a couple of things we
hadn't hypothesized.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were two genes related to dopamine
metabolism with abnormalities.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was for the gene that codes the
dopamine type two receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an interesting receptor in that
it's the target for anti-psychotic drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people have a mutation there,
as we saw in the CHS patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're at risk for a whole bunch of
things, addiction to other substances,
[SPEAKER_02]: also risk for psychosis and other
psychiatric issues to a strong degree,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it be depression, anxiety,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also a mutation in what's called
the COMT, catechol-O-methyltransferase
[SPEAKER_02]: gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the gene that breaks down dopamine
and again, if there were a problem there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might get a buildup of dopamine that
would provoke addictive behavior or that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was one that made sense
though, because all of what we've
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned so far sort of, it informs the
symptomatology and phenomenology of CHS,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning that it helps explain some of the
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: TRPV1 among other things has to do with
propulsion in the gut.
[SPEAKER_02]: If things aren't moving, you'll tend to
vomit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also is in the brain and is associated
with anxiety and pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things begin to make a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fifth mutation that we saw was
something we had not expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a gene called ABCA1 that has to do
with cholesterol metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one's a little ominous because
people who have mutations on this gene may
[SPEAKER_02]: be susceptible to a number of problems
later in life, specifically coronary
[SPEAKER_02]: artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
and Alzheimer disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do not know yet because this hasn't
been arrested around yet, are folks with
[SPEAKER_02]: CHS that have this mutation at greater
risk for these disorders?
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is quite possibly yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this takes on another dimension of
public health relevance that we really
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be examining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so a lot of different genes kind
of in play here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like they might have some
mutations that sort of give them a
[SPEAKER_00]: propensity to over, maybe overuse or
become reliant on cannabis, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: get them into the higher dose range to
sort of trigger this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also have additional mutations
that might bring on these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, certainly before and in the interim,
we've had the occasion to hear from a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people with CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for better or worse, a lot of them
have had substance abuse issues with other
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have seen and heard
corroborates the genetic findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is the thought that, you know,
genetic screening could be used to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: inform folks like you might be at risk at
this, you know, kind of proceed with
[SPEAKER_00]: caution or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that would be reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's envision a scenario in which we have
a teenager and his older brother has had
[SPEAKER_02]: problems with CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's under peer pressure to start using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be a good idea to use this as a
screening device.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should make a distinction there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't a diagnostic test per se where,
you know, your blood sugar is above a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain level.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're looking at here is a tendency.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, we could have someone that
had mutations on all five genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were some patients that had
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they never exceeded a certain
threshold of cannabis usage, they might
[SPEAKER_02]: never have a problem with nausea and
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be at risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't mean that they'd be have
the syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, the trigger is having the
symptom scenario that fits the
[SPEAKER_02]: description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I didn't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of touched on it a bit,
but I wanted to maybe ask directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as treatments go, we've
mentioned capsaicin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I understand it, the only real cure
for this is to abstain from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that one must abstain for the rest
of their lives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there a certain layoff period that
then they can kind of resume cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've seen this scenario repeatedly
where somebody has CHS, they stop for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while, the symptoms abate, and then they
go back to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And almost invariably, they have a relapse
into CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can go a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of people stopping for six
months, sort of edging back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they might do OK for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they, again, start to edge up on
the dosage and develop tolerance,
[SPEAKER_02]: then they're likely to get hit again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, another issue is, can they use other
types of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried to advise people to try CBD only
products and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we usually heard was they did OK for
a time, but then things came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's complicated from a scientific
standpoint by the fact that most pure CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: products aren't pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the funny things about the
plant that the enzyme that makes CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDase synthase, also makes THC in small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we know, lab analyses are not
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not always reliable in this field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot, we'll call it in this
instance, a lot of CBD preparations are
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminated with THC that isn't
necessarily supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know the answer to that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be possible that there are other
components of cannabis that could help
[SPEAKER_02]: with this or be utilized that don't
provoke the problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the answer is sure possible,
but we don't know that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the only reasonable advice is,
once somebody has this, is our
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation is to abstain from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'd emphasize that this has
been described and well-documented in
[SPEAKER_02]: people using synthetic cannabinoids with
no herbal input.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not related.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's related to pesticides, which have
toxicities, but very different ones from
[SPEAKER_02]: what we see in CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also some theories out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could have something to do with hop
late and viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, to date, there is no virus
affecting plants that's jumped to humans,
[SPEAKER_02]: number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, it's really a total leap in
logic to think that this has something to
[SPEAKER_02]: do with hop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hop late and viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a problem, but it's not causing
this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned that other non-cannabis
CB1 agonists can sort of trigger this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about endogenous cannabinoids,
endocannabinoids, anandamide, 2AG?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know that those can sort of be
elevated after exercise or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any cases of that maybe
triggering about?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we don't have a basis for
saying that that's a factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The place where you see an excess of
endocannabinoid function is usually in
[SPEAKER_02]: relation to metabolic syndrome or type 2
diabetes.
[SPEAKER_02]: To date, I'm not aware of folks with those
conditions getting it from exercise,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, that's an interesting
theoretical question.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just can't say that that's a factor
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, do folks who have CHS,
do they have other endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: related dysfunction after they've sort of
developed the condition?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else we've noticed is a lot of
folks with CHS have unhealthy lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've heard a lot about junk food,
having a sort of American diet that's
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy on pro-inflammatory input rather
than anti-inflammatory input.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, use of other substances,
alcohol, tobacco, coke, opioids,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, a strong thread of dependency on
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, I know we touched on it before,
that especially online, there is sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: vocal group of folks who are sort of
skeptical that CHS even exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in looking at some of the results from
your survey here, folks who even have CHS
[SPEAKER_00]: are skeptical that THC could be the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that still the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the tide sort of changing a bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can't remember the name of the
movie, but Anthony Hopkins' character in
[SPEAKER_02]: this movie once told these kids,
wishing does not make it so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's certainly the case here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how to phrase this,
but folks with CHS as a group are often
[SPEAKER_02]: very skeptical of the medical community
and what they've been told about this
[SPEAKER_02]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no doubt in my mind that this
exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have shown with statistical
significance difference between folks that
[SPEAKER_02]: express these problems as compared to
folks who use an equal amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: that don't have the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is real and needs to be taken
seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is this common amongst folks who use
cannabis for medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that that can sometimes be
in high doses.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, much, much less often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the reason is clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is there's usually a big
difference in daily dosing between someone
[SPEAKER_02]: who's using recreationally, we'll call it,
as compared to controlling symptoms,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it be pain, spasticity,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we are aware of medical patients
who have been affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: The numbers are very small and I think
it's usually attributable to the dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we suspect that inhalation places a
higher risk as opposed to more steady oral
[SPEAKER_02]: dosing, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some risk if someone's
susceptible, but I'd say that numbers of
[SPEAKER_02]: medical patients who've been affected with
CHS are very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so sort of where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go with this information?
[SPEAKER_00]: How should folks who enjoy cannabis sort
of proceed with caution or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, people should be judicious in their
dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be aware that if they're using
high potency material, they've got to use
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would hope that people would be
satisfied with a certain level of high,
[SPEAKER_02]: not push the limits to the stratosphere or
beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: How high can you get?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, different direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do we go from here in terms of
additional research?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are, again, putting together a
consortium of folks where we want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger numbers and really examine this in
a variety of different disciplines to see
[SPEAKER_02]: what else we can find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there additional genetic associations?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just mention one that's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our survey, we asked about whether
women who were affected, who had had
[SPEAKER_02]: children, had hyperemesis, which is a
morning sickness on steroids, whether
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd been affected with that during
their pregnancies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the numbers were very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, genetic susceptibility to
hyperemesis gravidarum has been
[SPEAKER_02]: associated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we didn't see mutations on that gene,
but we weren't looking for them either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having another crack at this with
larger numbers of people, we can hone in
[SPEAKER_02]: on that or see what other chance
associations there may be because we found
[SPEAKER_02]: them already.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know about the association with
dopamine metabolism, nor with cholesterol
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, beyond the issue of how much
cannabis people use, these have important
[SPEAKER_02]: implications on a public health level.
[SPEAKER_02]: What risks do people with these traits
have?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it goes without saying that in
medicine, we need to be much more
[SPEAKER_02]: effective at prevention.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always better to deal with the
problem before it becomes acute or chronic
[SPEAKER_02]: and exceeds the threshold where it's
affecting someone's lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having this knowledge may be a big
advantage going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other factor, the cost factor
involved with this I hadn't mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a study done in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, not even that recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found then the average patient
who received a CHS diagnosis had spent
[SPEAKER_02]: $96,000 in tests or ER visits and
associated costs before they got the
[SPEAKER_02]: diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, again, if we can identify this
earlier, it's going to be to everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit and pocketbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And circling back to sort of, you know,
limiting one's consumption, I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing that Dustin Sulak always talks
about is sort of taking a tolerance break
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, whether it's weekly or
ever frequently to sort of reset one's
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't need to use such higher
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could that be a reasonable thing to do to
try to prevent this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it may well be helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And particularly in relation to medical
users, he uses the resensitization
[SPEAKER_02]: procedure when he thinks that someone's
taking atypically high doses to treat
[SPEAKER_02]: their condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very briefly, how it's done is
abstention totally for 48 hours and then
[SPEAKER_02]: resuming at half the prior dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what's fascinating is usually the
efficacy in treating symptoms is as good
[SPEAKER_02]: as it was at the higher dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I think if people, again,
are very judicious about how much and how
[SPEAKER_02]: often they're using cannabis, there will
be fewer problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winding down here, Ethan, before I let
you go, I want to give you a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: plug any other resources that you think
might be helpful for folks to learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: about this topic or get in touch with you
or learn about the work that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, about CHS, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a website, what-is-chs.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatischs.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is information about the disorder
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a link to our article on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, if people are interested in
getting the screening test for CHS,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are links there to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And theoretically, we would get some
income from that, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, all my papers, including two
on CHS, are available at ethanruso.org at
[SPEAKER_02]: the library tab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, the website for our company
is credocredo-science.com.
