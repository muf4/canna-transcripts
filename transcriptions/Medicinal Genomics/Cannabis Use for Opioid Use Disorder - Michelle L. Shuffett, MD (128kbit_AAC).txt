[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Michelle Shuffett, and I'm here
today on behalf of Columbia Care to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: with you a little bit about medical
cannabis and opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I get started, I actually
wanted to just share a few stories with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking with a really good friend of
mine earlier this week, my business coach
[SPEAKER_00]: and good friend, Karen Eldad, and we were
talking about this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said to her, first of all,
you know, I might be a wee bit nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's the first time I've been in
front of people in two years, so it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys are excited about
it, but I'm nervous and excited,
[SPEAKER_00]: so bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, I asked her, do you still
think the opioid epidemic is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: hot topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some chuckles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she laughed as well, and she's like,
of course it's a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, you see it in the news every
single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's political banter,
updates on lawsuits, and overdoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a matter of fact, when I woke up
this morning and turned on the TV in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hotel room, the very first news story I
saw was about three people overdosing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hotel in downtown LA last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went on to have a more amusing
conversation, and I won't torture you with
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it, but we also talked about TV
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like Breaking Bad probably wouldn't
have been quite as interesting without the
[SPEAKER_00]: opioid epidemic fueling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently, I think Dope Sick is
actually a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many of you have seen
Dope Sick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful show, beautiful show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what Dope Sick did is it
humanized the opioid epidemic in such a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful way from so many different
perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it was the physician who
ultimately became the patient or the
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the rural communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me personally, the opioid epidemic
was humanized by my father.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew up in a very small town in
Kentucky, and my father was the local
[SPEAKER_00]: country doc, the family practitioner,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as he started to see what these drugs
were doing to the rural communities around
[SPEAKER_00]: us, he got really interested in trying to
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd always had an interest in
addiction medicine and that sort of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he went through additional
certifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got some other training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ultimately opened one of the first
suboxone clinics in the area and really
[SPEAKER_00]: helped a lot of folks with this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know he made a difference because at
his funeral in 2011, there were several of
[SPEAKER_00]: those recovered addicts that came and they
came to pay their respects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came to say thank you one last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't share that story because it's
a sad story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I share that story because I think it's
very inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason we're all willing to
take time out of our busy lives and come
[SPEAKER_00]: to meetings like this is because we truly
want to change things and elevate the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and try to help with this
particular problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, we will jump right in to the
lovely hot topic, the opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these numbers are from 2020
publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it hasn't really changed since
the last time I talked about this on stage
[SPEAKER_00]: in probably 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had almost 2 million folks misusing
prescription products for the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: and over 10 million misusing them on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the death rate has only gotten higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 70,000 people died from a drug
overdose in 2019, according to this data
[SPEAKER_00]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the breakdown,
it's not heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the street drugs that folks used
to die from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the synthetic opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the things that are being prescribed
to these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite frankly, it's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This call out is from the CDC and they
told me to talk a lot about the economic
[SPEAKER_00]: burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost $80 billion, billion with a B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's total healthcare costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's loss of productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also direct healthcare needs and
things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about all these things
and you think about everything we've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned over the years, what else can we
do to make an impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: What other things can come into play here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we really need to start
thinking about the problem in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I happen to be a fan of Adam Grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use his favorite phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to think again about this and
really be open to different solutions and
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think cannabis gives us a great
opportunity to think again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the first folks that opened the
door to these possibilities was Bob
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was an associate professor at
Montefiore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and his colleagues were hearing,
anecdotally speaking, that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients were substituting their opioid
prescriptions with cannabis when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they put together a research project
and they started to look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found is a really
interesting trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found that between 1999 and 2010,
in states that had medical cannabis laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: the overdose mortality rate from opioids
was about 25% lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he even went on to predict that
medical cannabis would ultimately fall
[SPEAKER_00]: into the category of alternatives for
treating chronic pain so that folks can
[SPEAKER_00]: either lower their dose or they can have a
different option besides opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this paper was published in JAMA in
2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we move on, NASM provided even more
evidence, the National Academies of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their report on the health effects of
cannabis and cannabinoids came out in
[SPEAKER_00]: January of 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't looked recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's been updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if anyone knows, shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a beautiful collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they determined that there are three
areas where there's conclusive or
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial evidence that cannabis and
cannabinoids are effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chronic pain in adults was one of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they based this on about 30 randomized
controlled trials, about 2,500 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were all very small trials,
small studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in totality, they decided that it was
a conclusive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen a lot of people talk about
this set of three as it should be changed
[SPEAKER_00]: to three plus one now because we have
Epidiolex, which several folks have talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about over the past few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, in a good way,
Bakuber's prediction actually came true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the New England Journal of Medicine
in 2017, Volko and Collins added
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids to the treatment of chronic
pain as a short-term strategy and also as
[SPEAKER_00]: an intermediate strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that time and before that time,
there's been more and more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can begin to highlight all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to share a few of the key
ones to set up the story because what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to talk about today is
real-world evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that real-world evidence comes from
the Columbia Care IMPACT database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And IMPACT stands for Integrating
Marijuana Program Analytics and Current
[SPEAKER_00]: Treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this database came about because of
New York state laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many states have these same laws,
but seed to sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to track where the product is
going from the market to the moment that
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes into existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also had the advantage of having a
lot of information from the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: registration process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to, in New York, for example,
have a qualifying condition but also an
[SPEAKER_00]: associated or complicating condition or
symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most states have some variation or
iteration of all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I have listed here are some of
the more common ones that are common
[SPEAKER_00]: across states, not just relevant to New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these things came together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2013, Columbia Care looked at it
and decided, OK, let's organize all this
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's put together what's essentially
an individual EMR for each of the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: or customers because they do pay for
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were able to put together a
database that contained information on
[SPEAKER_00]: patient demographics, the conditions,
the associated conditions and symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the types of products that were
purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would understand how much THC,
how much CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some states, they could even understand
terpenes, things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also route of administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they taking inhaled products,
oral products, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PDMP, which might be a bit of a
tedious thing for some folks, actually
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to be a very, very large positive in
this case because the PDMP requires
[SPEAKER_00]: logging of cannabis, but also other
controlled substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had information on narcotics,
benzos, barbiturates, things like Lyrica,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is an interesting one to
have in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all those things together,
when you want to do an analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really start to understand what's
the most effective product for a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can understand a little bit about what
product formulation might work the best
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of information about dose
ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the key here, and this is
something that Bonnie mentioned during her
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation, is all of these patients are
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to actually purchase the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding that repeat purchases
could be a good surrogate for efficacy was
[SPEAKER_00]: a really important thing in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, the database is quite
robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't walk through all the numbers
here, but what we're gonna do today is
[SPEAKER_00]: look at some of the information associated
with chronic pain and also with
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good deal of neuropathy involves
pain, so it's a really nice way to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: two things that are similar but very
different as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first pilot study is neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened is the pharmacists in
the dispensaries started to notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: there were a lot of opioid usage in the
peripheral neuropathy patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started to look at that
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they recruited folks ages 18 to 80 who
were using opioid products when they
[SPEAKER_00]: started their medical cannabis and looked
at them over the course of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a nine-month period,
and they found that 62% of patients were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to stabilize, reduce, or eliminate
their opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was based on MMEs and calculating
the totals over the course of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the decrease in its entirety was a bit
different depending on whether the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: was a new start or a continuing patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the patient was a new start,
identified and followed prospectively,
[SPEAKER_00]: the decrease was about 22%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was someone that was already on the
products when they started the study,
[SPEAKER_00]: the decrease was only about 13.8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that makes sense, logically,
because if you have someone who's already
[SPEAKER_00]: on a product, they don't have as much room
to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their ability to have a delta is
reduced just simply by the fact they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been on it for a while already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a counterpoint, it's important to
note that about 28% actually increased
[SPEAKER_00]: their opioid usage during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tried to understand perhaps what
was going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those patients who did
increase their opioid usage were patients
[SPEAKER_00]: undergoing cancer treatment, and they had
cancer treatment related neuropathies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads you to believe that perhaps
they were having extremely severe pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this breaks it down in more detail for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll see on the y-axis is the
total milligrams dispensed over the time
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's broken down into the 3 quarters
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dark blue bars represent the total
milligrams of THC, while the lighter blue
[SPEAKER_00]: are the MMEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a reminder, the MMEs went down by
21.9% in this particular group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the slope of the line,
sort of that dashed dark blue line towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of the slide, you'll see that
the THC didn't particularly change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was probably maybe the most
exciting thing about it, because when they
[SPEAKER_00]: started to do this, they were incredibly
worried that all people were doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: substituting one problem for another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found out that wasn't the case,
which is really fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: These data were pretty exciting to a group
of researchers in New York, and
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers from the New York Psychiatric
Institute, and NPI, I think it's typically
[SPEAKER_00]: called.
[SPEAKER_00]: They verified that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used it to apply for a NIDA grant
successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still doing some analysis of a
much more expanded data set right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I don't, I'll be honest, I don't know
a ton about, but I read it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It popped up in a Medscape article.
[SPEAKER_00]: And real world evidence is catching on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may have been at Jeff Chen's
presentation earlier today talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: real world evidence and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is additional real world evidence on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came out of the American Academy of
Orthopedic Surgeons meeting, which
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at chronic back pain and
osteoarthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that those with chronic
back pain had a significant reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: MMEs when they started medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they used the PDMP as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a pretty long study period,
about 18 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more than one third of the patients
stopped taking their opioids altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the OA group, very similar results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks to be a shorter study period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I haven't been able to find the
original pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made this slide on the plane on the way
here, as a matter of fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, about a third of the patients
stopped using their opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think folks are placing a lot more
value on what's happening in the real
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what other lessons can we learn from
impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: How to use medical cannabis for pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think Eloise went through
really great insights there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't spend too much time on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you think about it, all pain is
not created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that some pain might respond
better to a higher CBD product,
[SPEAKER_00]: while other pain elements might respond
better to a higher THC product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we skip over to the far right-hand
side of the slide, the higher CBD products
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to do better for neuropathic pain and
inflammation, whereas the higher THC
[SPEAKER_00]: products respond better to the types of
pain that typically require opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual drug delivery type matters a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the pharmacists have found in
looking at these patients using medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for pain is most folks use more
than one delivery type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it, it makes
perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use the sort of illustrated PK
on the right-hand side there to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dark blue line represents
inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the peak goes up really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rapid onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lasts for a little bit, maybe two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes down just as quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really nice for breakthrough
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going about your daily life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have bouts of pain, but you don't want
to have any sort of negative impact
[SPEAKER_00]: related to an adverse event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to quick on, quick off,
and keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas oral products, the gray line on
that PK chart, have a much softer slope,
[SPEAKER_00]: a softer rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They last a good bit longer, anywhere from
6 to 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go off slowly as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important when you think
about things like being able to sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: through the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have pain that prevents you from
sleeping, you want something that lasts a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sublingual falls more or less
right in the middle of those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to particularly talk about
transdermal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not as much understanding there of
exactly how that works, whether it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: about the actual physical application of
the product causing some pain relief
[SPEAKER_00]: versus being penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's folks here much more
qualified to talk about that than I would
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we'll go into the details of that
chronic pain versus neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the chronic pain
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be included in this analysis,
you had to have at least three purchases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically about three months worth of
use of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chronic pain patients on average
were about 53 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: More or less an equal balance of male,
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most common prescribed ratio was a
high THC product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use the word prescribed even though
the technical word is recommended because
[SPEAKER_00]: they would come into the pharmacy and have
this recommendation, this prescription,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't necessarily have to buy
those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pharmacist had the leeway to change it
in most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most common product purchase
aligned in this particular instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 55% were choosing the high THC
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the per milligram
daily dose, you see that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendously high even when you compare
the first invoice versus the most recent
[SPEAKER_00]: invoice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use the word invoice when we're
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, it's a purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're looking at what was on that
invoice that gets recorded in the PDMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two horizontal lines reflect the
mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is the mean value for the
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 24.5 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most recent was 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we switch to neuropathy,
we're going to see some differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average age for the neuropathy
patients was a bit older.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tended to be more men than women.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same most common prescribed ratio,
that higher THC product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the actual purchases,
you see some differences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not equally a third, a third,
a third.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's pretty close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So patients were using different product
types when they had neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the actual mean dose,
it's a lower THC dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we think back to that chart I
showed earlier, that makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the way neuropathy causes pain,
the higher CBD, less THC is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it aligned with just common practice
and common thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to close with a little bit on
adverse events and what we've learned from
[SPEAKER_00]: the impact database there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that they vary based on
product ratio, the route of
[SPEAKER_00]: administration, and previous experience
with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a laundry list of AEs that
have been reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from sleepiness to increased
appetite, dizziness, paranoia,
[SPEAKER_00]: nausea, vomiting, all of the things that
we're all very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the most important thing and
the thing that I always talk about when I
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to patients is that you have to
manage their expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone is aware that they might feel
sleepy, it's less scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them feel more comfortable when
they actually have that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also important to understand that
one person's side effect is another
[SPEAKER_00]: person's benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm having trouble sleeping,
I want a product that makes me sleepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not and I'm trying to get through
my work day, I don't want to be sleepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really talking to your patients and
really having very open conversations is
[SPEAKER_00]: always super important to manage those
expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did do an analysis of the data at
Columbia Care specifically to geriatrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was actually presented the last
time I presented it, Ken, Matt,
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: We presented the full data set on
geriatric patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the portion I wanted to talk about to
call out here was just related to the AEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the self-reported AEs were similar,
regardless of whether the patients were 70
[SPEAKER_00]: plus or less than 45, which was this
particular analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased appetite was the most common in
both age groups at about 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most important thing, and I think
Eloise hit on this a few times in her
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation, there weren't a lot of
issues with disorientation or confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 6.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those 70 plus who reported that at any
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually it was with the first dose
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't a long-lasting effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the most important
things about that is it means it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can titrate up safely in these
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some of the average doses
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anyone's interested in this
particular data set, I can share the
[SPEAKER_00]: abstract with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can look back, I think,
in the CanMed archives and see it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, when we talk about
cannabis and pain, all pain is not created
[SPEAKER_00]: equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't share a common etiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have a common solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to think about it differently
and think again about how we're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: care of these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think real-world evidence from
registry data such as IMPACT can really
[SPEAKER_00]: help us understand what's happening,
how people are using it in a practical
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we know that they have to
purchase the product, it's a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: surrogate about efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adverse events vary based on ratio,
route of administration, and previous
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, more work is
needed to understand all these best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff earlier was trying to quote someone
saying that every time you do one study,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need four more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who said that either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can quote you, Jeff, since you said
it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time today.
Thank you.
