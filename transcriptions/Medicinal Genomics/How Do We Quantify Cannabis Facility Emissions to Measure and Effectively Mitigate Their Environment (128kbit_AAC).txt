[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm pleased to have this opportunity
to talk with you about something a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different and about the potential impacts
of cannabis emissions in the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something we need to understand
if we're going to have a sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll be going through a little
background about the plant volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions and their environmental impacts,
what we understand right now about these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis emissions, including that smell,
that cannabis smell, which is something
[SPEAKER_00]: we've figured out in the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, some solutions to
potential problems with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants emit hundreds of different
volatile compounds into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those you're very familiar with,
things you smell in your kitchen from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Floral scents are an obvious ones,
but there are a lot of other ones as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those we really can't smell very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole range of different
compounds coming from different processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question is, well, why are plants
emitting all these various compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them we know quite well what the
physiological roles are, what the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological roles are.
[SPEAKER_00]: An obvious one is pollination,
bringing in the birds and bees and seed
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also a lot of it's for protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants have these compounds for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these we know well for defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them we really don't understand
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are also the impacts on the
ambient environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these impacts can include very large
impacts on chemistry of the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse gases, air pollutants,
are impacted by these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a clean environment, these
compounds are emitted into the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get oxidized, chewed up into carbon
dioxide, reabsorbed by the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a clean environment, these plant
volatiles don't have an impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very different in a polluted
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we study this in a range of different
places, a really nice place.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the places where we've worked on
this has been in the middle of the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very clean, pristine area around,
just plant emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have the city of Manaus,
about two million people, unregulated
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions, so a lot of pollution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to go and do studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are studies sponsored by the
National Science Foundation, Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy, and Brazilian science agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have aircraft sampling systems
downwind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could sit there and look at what
was going on in the pristine environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then see what happens when the Manaus
plume goes over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens when you get the polluted
environment mixing with these plant
[SPEAKER_00]: volatiles, you make a lot of ozone,
a lot of particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are two major regional air
quality problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also very important short-term
climate forcers, so very large impacts on
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: My colleague, Will Visette, has done work
looking at areas like here in the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the impacts, including cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did a study looking at the emission
of these plant volatiles that you get from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the particular location where it
has been grown in Denver, you can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant impact on ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver has an ozone environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right on the edge of being in
compliance for ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of a push on ozone is a
huge problem for Denver and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the way these studies are done is
to go in, measure what's being emitted
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plants, and then extrapolating
that with a regional air quality model
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can run the model without the
cannabis emissions, and then run it with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis emissions, and you can see
the impact of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that impact is up to about a PPB of
ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the take-home message here is that
there's potential for cannabis-growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operations to have impact on air quality
in some regions, not in all regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if this were a clean area,
if this were pristine in the Amazon,
[SPEAKER_00]: not near Manaus, there wouldn't be any
impact at all of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have it in a dirty area,
particularly oxides of nitrogen around,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we have a lot of in our cities,
then you can make ozone and particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea that these volatile
emissions are important for global,
[SPEAKER_00]: the global environment is something we've
known for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these emissions are in all the
global climate models, all the regional
[SPEAKER_00]: air quality models, and we've kind of
worked out the impact of forest and
[SPEAKER_00]: large-scale vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recently, though, we've realized that
there also can be an impact on these urban
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, like Denver, like Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the past, we kind of ignored that,
both because it's so complicated to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: do the vegetation in an urban area,
but also because there was so much
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions of VOCs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But because our regulators have done such
a great job of reducing the VOC emissions
[SPEAKER_00]: in our cities, we're now at the point
where we think here in Los Angeles County,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most populous county in the US,
about half of the emissions of these
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile organic compounds, which impact
smog, ozone, and particles, about half of
[SPEAKER_00]: it's coming from plants, and all these
compounds are not equal in terms of their
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on ozone and particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones coming from plants actually
have more of an impact than those coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from cars and factories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think it's actually more than half
of the impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because we've been studying this on
the global scales for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: for these large-scale impacts,
we have models.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have models that we've developed and,
again, are in all the climate models and
[SPEAKER_00]: regional air quality models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, you look at how much
vegetation there is, look at the weather,
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat, temperature, all the things that
would affect these emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do these studies going from small
scales, understanding the biochemistry of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on, to looking at large
scales where we can see, how does it
[SPEAKER_00]: impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, these plant VOC on their
own don't have an impact, but it's when
[SPEAKER_00]: they impact with anthropogenic emissions,
there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do aircraft studies, now we have
satellite data, and so we can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: expand and look at the large-scale
impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, on the small scales,
where we can use these enclosure
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements and understand for individual
plants what they emit and what controls
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature, light, stress are an
important part of the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these models, and using these
enclosures under controlled conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can figure out what's controlling all
of these emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now back to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first started studying this a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the interesting things was
people didn't really know what that odor
[SPEAKER_00]: was, the skunky odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, of course, with cannabis,
there's this potential for air quality
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts, but also just local odor impacts
is an important issue in a lot of areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking to people in the cannabis
industry, a lot of people thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it's this skunky terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mercyne was thrown out as a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've got bottles of Mercyne in my
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell skunky at all,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, some of them may be a little
musty, but nothing that smells like a
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, of course, we knew, well,
the odor of a skunk is a thyle,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of different sulfur
compounds that have that odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunky beer are thyles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of keyed in on that and looking
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we could see in these cannabis
emissions both looking at individual
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and looking in facilities,
we could see 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3-2-1-MBT is the key compound,
the key skunky smell in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could do that by, again,
isolating the plant, looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions, so we know it's really coming
directly from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, we use analytical
techniques, TDGC-TOF-MS, to work this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at the mass spectra,
compare to NIST, to authentic samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also compared it to Corona beer that I
stuck out in the sun for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can figure out what these thyls
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also working with our colleagues who
do olfactometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so olfactometry is a technique where
you're not using expensive analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: detectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use the person's nose, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these experts who will go
through and actually have this thing going
[SPEAKER_00]: from the gas chromatograph, which
separates the compounds, individual
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, and it goes to a person's nose
and they write down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grassy, it's piney, it's skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is key, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can analytically determine
what's in the sample, but we need
[SPEAKER_00]: something connected to a nose and a human
brain to say, hey, this is this odor that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a nuisance issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a key part of this approach was
combining these two, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Combining our advanced analytical
techniques and combining human sensory
[SPEAKER_00]: odor panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we worked with our colleagues,
Jasik Kozel and Don Wright, in combining
[SPEAKER_00]: this into an ASTM standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ASTM is an organization that develops
these standard approaches that people can
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the problems right now with
odor nuisance is there aren't standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in most cases, the way agencies deal
with this is somebody complains about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our monitoring system is the neighbor's
nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what we're relying on right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the problem with that is different
people are going to respond differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might send someone out with a nose
ranger and try to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in other parts of air quality,
we have standards based on this much ozone
[SPEAKER_00]: is a problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that for odor until we
develop standards where we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitatively say, no, this is a problem
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an additional complication,
though, in that the ratios of these odors
[SPEAKER_00]: are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one potential possibility,
because these files are really difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to measure, and they're at really low
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one possible you might think of is,
well, let's just measure the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: because cannabis is emitting terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's emitting files.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go measure terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we measure terpenes, well,
then probably there's a cannabis odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the terpenes can actually
mask the cannabis odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes right near the source,
you can't detect that skunky odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's when it goes downwind to the
elementary school, a couple blocks away,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the odor can actually be greater than
it is right at the fence line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's somewhat complicated there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we solve this issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: And using these enclosure measurements,
we can determine for different cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains what those ratios are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, not just getting the amount of
file, but the ratio of the file to the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, because those ratios are really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: These files are at really low
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have analytical techniques that can
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, going back to those models that we
developed for global climate models and
[SPEAKER_00]: regional air quality models, we use a
similar kind of approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're calling it the cannabis emission
profiler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we can get for a facility,
for a greenhouse, or a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can determine exactly, quantitatively,
what the mass emission of files is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the files and terpenes are using
these enclosure measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we can look at differences
in juvenile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering, obviously, are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to consider these different
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the solution is, well, we have
techniques that can remove these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one approach might be, well,
we have these techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just throw a bunch of it out there
and remove everything we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it costs money, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put these out there, it takes a lot of
energy to run these carbon scrubbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to either regenerate or dispose
of the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important to one,
know the type of carbon so that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically targeting those files and
terpenes, but then right sizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been working on getting
exactly how much is going out there so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get the right amount of removal
technology, but not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the excess energy and
sustainability issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, for example, so we can just
quantitatively determine for the size of a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, for the emission, because we
know the individual plants, what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: emitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can determine how many of these
molecular filtration systems you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Byers has been working on
developing improved systems, improved in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the efficiency, so the power is
lower, improving the effectiveness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon that's used in there, and also the
ability to reuse this carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, typically, it's just thrown
away into landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be able to not do that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, third party testing
is important to validate that we really
[SPEAKER_00]: can remove these files.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can remove these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These systems are remarkably effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also go beyond that to other issues
that are important for cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of pathogens, other kinds of
things that might be important for indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: air quality for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ASPR is something that's recently been
added to this system for removing
[SPEAKER_00]: particles, biological particles and other
particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, using third party testing,
these are remarkably effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have solutions for getting rid of
these odors, getting rid of these
[SPEAKER_00]: particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our focus is on doing this effectively
and including the use of smart systems
[SPEAKER_00]: that would say, hey, it's time to replace
the carbon in this system and getting real
[SPEAKER_00]: time data.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's some kind of a leak or an issue
going on, then we can immediately,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And saying, hey, we've got a problem in
the facility right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an outdoor cannabis farm in Sonoma
County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm surrounded by vineyards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are constantly having the
conversation about are terpenes tainting
[SPEAKER_02]: their grapes and the smell of skunky
smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowing that that's thiols and it's
organic sulfur, vineyards use sulfur to
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an argument to be made that our
thiols are actually benefiting their
[SPEAKER_02]: grapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been really interesting to me
in kind of getting into this field and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing how the vintners can dump all kinds
of stuff on the vineyards, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis people can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really, yeah, this terpene drift
issue is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know they've been focusing a lot on
eucalyptol as one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done some study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really minor component.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be really rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Australia, if you have a lot of
eucalyptus trees going around,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's unlikely with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, with this kind of approach,
well, then we can tell, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go see exactly what are the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can model exactly what's
getting deposited on the grapes and
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate that and figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in most cases, you can clearly
show that's not a problem.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful talk.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slightly off topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your expertise sounds like you may be
able to answer this pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this talk was kind of off topic for
this conference, too, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a number of indoor cannabis grows in
California are moving more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: towards oxidizing agents as a way to A,
odor control, and B, be effective as a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide, an alternative to chemical
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, in indoor facilities
where they're fairly clean, the use of
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidizers like a number of different
oxidizers, I could talk about CLO2 gas is
[SPEAKER_01]: one that's starting to be used more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we putting workers potentially in
danger?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are we basically creating clean
breakdown products when those oxidizers
[SPEAKER_01]: are mixing with these volatiles from the
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, when you use oxidizers,
oxidizers to break down these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just because there's so much terpene
load in there and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: including even if you've moved the plants
out, a lot of that stuff is condensed into
[SPEAKER_00]: a film on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of what they're trying to
clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to generate all these
aldehydes in there, which can be really
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's a real issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something people really haven't been
looking at very much, what's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: created.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's good reason to suspect that
that can really be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, there's a follow-up question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you recommend any good sensors that we
can put in place in these facilities to
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor for the aldehydes and other things
that might be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fortunately, what we have right now,
there are really good sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are really cheap sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really not very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the state of the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we need something more in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kind of online, continuous
sensors, which would be nice to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what can be done is kind of just grab
sampling, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So going out, collecting samples,
and analyzing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably right now,
that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting thing that brings up,
though, is that not only people do this
[SPEAKER_00]: for cleaning, and you might do that in
between your harvest, but other people are
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting you should use some kind of
oxidant for just cleaning the air right
[SPEAKER_00]: during the normal procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely going to be
generating a lot of these aldehydes and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just that really people need to
be careful with doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had looked into that, or Myers has
looked into that, and was thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: that as a potential thing to use,
and decided, no, there's just too many
[SPEAKER_00]: risks about these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you get rid of that original
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do get rid of the files, but you're
going to generate all these small
[SPEAKER_00]: aldehydes, and it's just not going to be a
good thing.
