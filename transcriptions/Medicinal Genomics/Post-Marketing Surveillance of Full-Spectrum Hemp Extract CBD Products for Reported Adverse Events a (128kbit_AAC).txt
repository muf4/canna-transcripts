[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are your brains tapped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty full, yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whoever's after me, I will be taking
about 20 minutes, so we're running
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 10 minutes late, so you've got
some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me tell you a quick story about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a paper that we just submitted
that I have to say quite honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never got so much pushback from
reviewers, and you'll see why in a second,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's also a reason here that I'm
presenting this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just FYI, I am not an employee of
Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna talk about Charlotte's Web
products, but essentially what we did is a
[SPEAKER_00]: surveillance of their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to commend Charlotte's Web for
actually doing the right thing and really
[SPEAKER_00]: getting involved with trying to create
more of a safety database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's where we're gonna go today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna start with what I call the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go to the methods we use to help add
to data to solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about the AEs, the actual
adverse events, and then we will go into
[SPEAKER_00]: these serious adverse events, and then
finally we'll talk about the limitations
[SPEAKER_00]: of everything we've done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so safety data, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great, but clinical trials can
often be a group of people that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily represent the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need more safety data, my feeling in
general, for all cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this method that I'm gonna talk about
could apply to all cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's also a huge barrier for
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD's relaxed a little bit, but because of
schedule one, there's so many,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember what I had to do to
just get a CB1 antagonist when I was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bit onerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, Charlotte's Web has made this
data available, and essentially I took the
[SPEAKER_00]: data and did what I could with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's talk about methods we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, and this may seem like a simple
method, but it's actually per FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phone number on these,
oh, I thought I had a, animation there,
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, there's a phone number here at the
bottom of this label that points out where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get ahold of somebody if you're
having some sort of an issue with the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really important piece,
and that's often something that's not done
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanna call and talk about an
adverse event, you've got that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we put together a database,
and the database, we followed industry
[SPEAKER_00]: standards based on the CPSC, the EPA,
and the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, what this database doesn't
include is, it includes some patient
[SPEAKER_00]: demographics, but not a lot of it,
and it's not designed to collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific reason why the consumer used the
product, although sometimes Charlotte's
[SPEAKER_00]: Web and their system was able to pick up
that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so safety costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety Call is a group out of,
I think they're in Jersey, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere on the East Coast, and they have
set up a really excellent surveillance
[SPEAKER_00]: program for all of industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you're using bug spray,
or you're using CBD products, or you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using a dietary supplement, Safety Call
has got a service that allows you to track
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of adverse events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the scheme they use,
and I'll go through each step of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: phase one, phase two, and phase three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phase one, let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So intake and documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a narrative of the product use
and reported adverse effects on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're looking for accurate
identification of product or active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say that you look at a lot
of published studies on herbal medicines
[SPEAKER_00]: in general, and their adverse events,
or the case studies where there was an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue and they never characterized the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't even know if it's really the
right product that we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it actually had the right
ingredients that it claimed it had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we did pick up some of the
demographics, as I mentioned, but often
[SPEAKER_00]: not everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at circumstances and
time course of exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, specific adverse effects
experienced and sufficient symptom
[SPEAKER_00]: characterization to be able to categorize
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this real?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something we need to pursue further?
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase two, what was done here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is essentially a follow-up of phase one
incidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So detailed information was collected
regarding the most recent exposure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the history of exposure, the details of
the adverse symptoms, treatment of the
[SPEAKER_00]: adverse symptoms, if there was any
treatment, brief but relevant medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: drug history, if they could gather that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if subjects received medical
treatments, medical records were obtained
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all of this seems rather nebulous
because you're dealing with consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not dealing with somebody that's in
a hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get what you can from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they refuse to answer,
or sometimes they don't know, or sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an email chain and there's just not
enough data there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase three is where the rubber hits the
road, and you actually get a healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: provider, a physician, experienced in
adverse drug events involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they look at temporality, they look at
biological, physiological, pharmacological
[SPEAKER_00]: plausibility, and they look at alternative
causes that could have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really how this whole system
was set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then further in phase three,
de-challenged, did the product exposure
[SPEAKER_00]: withdrawal result in a meal acceleration
or elimination of the symptoms or reported
[SPEAKER_00]: effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the re-challenge, did a
re-challenge occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say when we get to the SAEs,
you're gonna be disappointed because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of times this wasn't done, but I'll go
through them nevertheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after the review, what's the
opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it real?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seriousness and need for follow-up,
this is that last slide, phase three,
[SPEAKER_00]: is done by a board-certified position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a case meets the serious adverse
event criteria, safety call prepares the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate MedWatch form and then reports
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a period of 18 months,
and it'll also give you an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte's web sales, but it's a period
of 18 months, and this is what was used to
[SPEAKER_00]: grade the adverse events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a typical, this is not
cannabinoid-friendly, this is just what is
[SPEAKER_00]: used in the industry to grade adverse
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grade one is considered very mild.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to grade three, it's more severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to grade five, well, you died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the dose range, now what Charlotte's
web has determined is that they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: about a 1.4 milligram per kilogram of CBD
average daily consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to hear comments from the
physicians as we get to the end of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it seems on the low end to me,
but maybe that's just my naivete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serving suggestions vary by product with
the highest recommended serving size of
[SPEAKER_00]: about 30 milligrams three times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're getting 90 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the results, what we found was
there were about two million product
[SPEAKER_00]: sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now product sales is what we had to use to
be able to establish any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics or at least numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize there's a huge limitation
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that limitation in a
second, but one product per house was
[SPEAKER_00]: really one person using it or were
multiple people using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just hard to know based on product
sales, but that's what we've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't know when something's out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a history of using product
sales with other data, such as some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, hair sprays and bug sprays and that
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used what we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to back it up with past experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, there was past experience
where they used product sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of AEs, not serious AEs,
but AEs was 431 during this period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we correlate that, and like I
said, we can't really do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you were to say roughly two million
people were using the product and there
[SPEAKER_00]: were 431 AEs, well, that's about 0.022%
AEs per unit sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a weak number, but it is a
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now SAE occurrence was about 0.00036% per
unit sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it gives us some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven serious AEs were categorized in this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the AEs, 98.4% were classified as
non-serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's a summary of the adverse
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't by any means stretch the
imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect you to be able to read
this, but we'll pull it out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we see is gastro effects,
gastrointestinal effects were the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common, nausea about 25 people,
general gastrointestinal symptoms about
[SPEAKER_00]: 16, abdominal discomfort about 11,
or products sold, and diarrhea about 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we look at the central nervous
system, headache was common, dizziness,
[SPEAKER_00]: common for adverse events, that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a very small percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But headaches, dizziness, and seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we look at the central,
the psych effects, anxiety in about 23
[SPEAKER_00]: users and insomnia in about 13 users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's our numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at serious adverse events,
and we can use per unit sold, we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: about 0.36 SAEs per 100,000 units.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the SAEs, there were two GI
issues, two neuro, two psych, and one
[SPEAKER_00]: ocular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go through these, and you can
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help me determine if you think
they're real, but I have an opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's still look at this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: 35-year-old using Charlotte's Web,
hemp extract, which is about 17 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: per mil for about 45 days for anxiety and
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dose was unclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was titrating up to 40 milligrams a
day, but we really don't know from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unspecified pharmaceuticals, so there were
pharmaceuticals on board as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this person developed agitation,
chills, night sweats, insomnia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and loss of appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then into a fever, stopped the CBD,
went to the in urgent care center,
[SPEAKER_00]: and was advised to go to the ER if his
fever didn't resolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: His fever continued for approximately
seven to eight more days, and he began to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience headaches, nausea, and vomiting
with blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: He presented to the ER blood and urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: No specific diagnosis was made,
released home with instructions to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: up with his PCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symptoms resolved within 10 days,
and that's what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he stop the CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he continue?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like the stomach flu,
I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so SAE2, grade three, 79-year-old
female who began using Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Original formula, that's about 50
milligrams per mil.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 milligrams per mil, three to four times
daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she escalated the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what kind of dose escalation
she did, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately one month after starting the
product, increased the dose, and continued
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing three to four times daily for a
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: She DC'd using the product because she was
no longer experiencing pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then one month later, she resumed
taking an unspecified amount of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product to help with sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at this point, she developed nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea, and reported to
[SPEAKER_00]: the ER where she was treated for
dehydration with IV fluids and an
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-nausea medication through her IV
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ER doctor thought her symptoms were
due to food poisoning, and she was
[SPEAKER_00]: released the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three days later, she took another
unspecified dose of the product to help
[SPEAKER_00]: with sleep, and again got sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: She discontinued using the product at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if this is accurate, it sounds likely
that this could have been an actual event.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's a lot that we don't know
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and her back pain returned the
following month, so she began using an
[SPEAKER_00]: unspecified dose of CBD and smaller doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, developed nausea, vomiting,
and diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got two or three
re-challenges here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does look like a likely SAE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another SAE, 41-year-old female as an
aggravation of her preexisting seizure
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dose was unknown and varied again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ER doctor thought her symptoms were
due to food poisoning, and she was
[SPEAKER_00]: released the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I must have a slide mixed up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her past medical history, unspecified
brain surgery over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was a juggling of things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how this happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: She reported that the number of her normal
seizures decreased from 30 to 40 per month
[SPEAKER_00]: to about eight per month while using the
product over five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: After five years of use, she gets a sudden
increase in her seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just not a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, 80-year-old using Charlotte's Web,
original formula, again, 50 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: mil, times four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her nerve pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she increased her dose, and shortly
after she increased her dose, she became
[SPEAKER_00]: lightheaded and confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her speech was slurred, and her eyes
wouldn't focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is four years in.
[SPEAKER_00]: She presented to the ER.
[SPEAKER_00]: CT scan was negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doc suggested a TIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symptoms subsided within 30 minutes,
and she was released to return home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately two months later,
she developed the same symptoms and went
[SPEAKER_00]: to the ER.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symptoms subsided within 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: CT scan was normal, admitted to the
hospital until she may have had another
[SPEAKER_00]: TIA if she had a TIA in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was released the next day with the
recommendation of follow-up with a PCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: She followed up with a PCP and a
neurologist, and the PCP stated there was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably an interaction between her
gabapentin and the THC in the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: product, which probably is unlikely if you
really look at the data with gabapentin.
[SPEAKER_00]: DC, the CBD in her gabapentin dose was
decreased by 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this one is interesting as well,
and this is a disruptive mood
[SPEAKER_00]: dysregulation, nine-year-old female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her dose, she was using 17 milligrams at
night and seven milligrams during the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what do we see here?
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother gave the daughter the
17-milligram product at night,
[SPEAKER_00]: the following evening, no product was
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so she's got about 24 hours here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next morning, now we're at 36 hours
roughly, the next morning the child's
[SPEAKER_00]: mother gives the child the seven-milligram
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a few hours, the child began to
exhibit behavioral changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was given another dose of the
seven-milligram product in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The child then became angry, punched her
mother and her mother's boyfriend,
[SPEAKER_00]: and began yelling suicidal statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a good strategy to get
attention, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no information on what psychiatric
medications this patient was on or if
[SPEAKER_00]: these medications were abruptly ceased and
replaced with the CBD product,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we really don't know much here,
so it's hard to pin this to the product
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's another one, another psych,
eight-year-old female using original
[SPEAKER_00]: formula hemp extract oil for autism
spectrum disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dose is 25 milligrams by mouth,
once to twice daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time the child received the product,
she acted out and cried briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day four, usual dose in the morning and
went to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: The school nurse called to report child
was having a seizure, vomiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: drooling, staring into space, and with her
eyes rolled back in her head,
[SPEAKER_00]: intermittently non-responsive,
transported to the ER by ambulance,
[SPEAKER_00]: where she was responsive upon arrival.
[SPEAKER_00]: The treating physician agreed that she
experienced a seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not think the product contributed
to her symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: No treatment was given.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was released after approximately five
hours, and she was asymptomatic upon
[SPEAKER_00]: release, remained asymptomatic one week
later at the time of the report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did she continue?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and then the last one, 73-year-old
female, dose of 30 milligrams daily hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: oil extract for arthritis pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three weeks after starting the product,
developed changes in her vision,
[SPEAKER_00]: movement in her vision at a lower part of
her right eye when nothing was there,
[SPEAKER_00]: flashing lights and steady lights,
diagnosed with ischemic optic neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They deseed the product and returned for a
follow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was on steroid eye drops as a
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine days later, returned to her
ophthalmologist for depth perception and
[SPEAKER_00]: visual field test with no significant
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two months later, had a 20% improvement in
her vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ophthalmologist and the PCP gave her
permission to start using the CP.
[SPEAKER_00]: She received CBD again, and one month
after restarting the product, reported
[SPEAKER_00]: that she believed her vision was
continuing to improve, but she had not yet
[SPEAKER_00]: had another test to confirm this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, previously documented AEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the Epidiolex study,
and here's what we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got somulans at 25% of the AEs,
not 25% of people, but 25% of the AEs,
[SPEAKER_00]: a decreased appetite, 22%, diarrhea,
20%, elevated transaminases, about 16%,
[SPEAKER_00]: fatigue, malaise, asthenia, about 12%,
lethargy, excuse me, 8%, and convulsions,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 11%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these doses are about 10-fold higher
than is typically used by Charlotte's Web
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's compare these, comparison of AEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one side, we've got the post-market
surveillance done with these lower dose
[SPEAKER_00]: products, Charlotte's Web's products.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other end, we've got the Epidiolex
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do see a commonality in terms of
gastrointestinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, the fatigue and
malaise a little bit there, if you
[SPEAKER_00]: consider nausea, but really not a lot of
correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about limitations of this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple reliable methods to collect AEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the AEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spontaneous reporting through national
pharmacovigilance databases, collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: practice data, soliciting events from
healthcare professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have their weaknesses,
direct observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've all got weaknesses,
they've all got strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So surveying patients obviously has some
weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this provides a starting point for
this sort of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's optimal data collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been great to have seen more
stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So confounding factors we could have had
here, underlying medical conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, prescription medications
obviously, dietary changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biological variability, life stressors,
they're all considerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just correlating units to people
is very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting told I need to get off the
stage here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am gonna jump to my last slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'd like to point out is,
as an industry, let's support this sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an industry, if you're running a
company, this is a really good chance for
[SPEAKER_00]: you to actually add to the database.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is considered not as strong as clinical
trials, but it is regular data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And FDA and European Medicine Agency use
this sort of data to make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consumer reported data to make
decisions about safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd really encourage you to consider
stepping up to the plate and doing more of
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if we could do this with some
of the other cannabinoids, CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: THCV, it'd be a huge plus to the safety
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
