[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Can Med Coffee Talk
podcast, where we talk with the leading
[SPEAKER_02]: minds in cannabis science, medicine,
cultivation, and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_02]: puts on the Can Med Conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in November already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what that means?
[SPEAKER_02]: The holidays are right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that comes a lot of things to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got people to buy for, parties to plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't it be nice if you could check
something off your to-do list right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can register for Can Med 23.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't already heard, Can Med 23
will be taking place May 15th through 17th
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Marriott Beach Resort on Marco
Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: This industry-leading event will feature
three full days of cannabis science
[SPEAKER_02]: content from more than 30 presenters and
instructors representing our key focus
[SPEAKER_02]: areas of science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And new for Can Med 23, we will also
explore psilocybin and psychedelic
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, due to the limited capacity of our
new location, Can Med 23 is an
[SPEAKER_02]: invitation-only event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we expect that it will sell out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've already gotten your
invitation to Can Med 23, please register
[SPEAKER_02]: and get that off your to-do list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you haven't, head over to
canmedevents.com now and request your
[SPEAKER_02]: invitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our guest this episode is Dr. Ziva Cooper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ziva is the director of the UCLA Cannabis
Research Initiative in the Jane and Terry
[SPEAKER_02]: Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human
Behavior.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's also an associate professor in the
Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral
[SPEAKER_02]: Sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Department of Anesthesiology at the
David Leffen Institute of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her current research involves
understanding variables that influence
[SPEAKER_02]: both the therapeutic potential and adverse
effects of cannabis and cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: through double-blind placebo-controlled
studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the variables Ziva and her team are
studying is the difference between men and
[SPEAKER_02]: women in their response to the
abuse-related and pain-relieving effects
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the role that circulating hormones and
endocannabinoids contribute to these
[SPEAKER_02]: differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the subject of our conversation
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about the key differences in how
cannabis affects males versus females,
[SPEAKER_02]: how females metabolize THC differently
than males, cannabis use tolerance
[SPEAKER_02]: differences in males versus females,
how female reproductive hormones play a
[SPEAKER_02]: role in sensitivity to THC, the importance
of placebo-controlled studies,
[SPEAKER_02]: and male versus female differences in
self-reporting pain, side effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation,
with Ziva, I want to thank this episode
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, Planetary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Planetary is the first and only organic
certified water extracted CBDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Female founded Planetary is truly
plant-based wellness designed to keep you
[SPEAKER_02]: moving and playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the only company to use water
extraction, Planetary keeps CBDA in its
[SPEAKER_02]: raw living form, the way it's actually
grown in the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDA is 18 times more bioavailable than
CBD and is a powerful anti-inflammatory,
[SPEAKER_02]: acting on the same pathway as NSAIDs like
ibuprofen.

[SPEAKER_02]: That's P-L-A-N-E-T-A-R-I-E dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Ziva
[SPEAKER_02]: Cooper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Ziva.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks so much for having me on the
Can Med Coffee Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today we're talking about sex
differences when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got the idea for this topic because
I was excited to have you on the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was looking through the many
publications you've authored and
[SPEAKER_02]: co-authored and I noticed one of the most
cited is sex-dependent effects of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabinoids, a translational
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I thought would be a great topic to
dive into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed that there are other papers
in your repertoire that explored sex
[SPEAKER_02]: differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine it's a topic that's close to
your heart or at least very important to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess my first question to you is why
do you feel it's an important topic to
[SPEAKER_02]: explore when it comes to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in general, there is an increasing
awareness of how important it is to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at both sex and gender effects across
medical research at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at some of the landmark
cannabis studies back in the 1970s and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those landmark cannabis studies
involved only men between the ages of like
[SPEAKER_01]: 19 and 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that since then,
we've evolved so much in our appreciation
[SPEAKER_01]: for really understanding how biologically
and also culturally, how important it is
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand across pharmacological
classes and across different medical
[SPEAKER_01]: health endpoints, the differences between
men and women or males and females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so cannabis is definitely not any
exception to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's especially relevant given the
fact that there has been a sharp increase
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis use among females over the
last decade and specifically medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're starting to see that a lot more
women are starting to gravitate towards
[SPEAKER_01]: using medical cannabis for specific
indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that even more gives us the real
justification and need to understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of cannabis and cannabinoids
between both men and women and understand
[SPEAKER_01]: if there are differences and why there
might be differences between the two
[SPEAKER_01]: sexes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I imagine one of the main
differences could be, and you can tell me
[SPEAKER_02]: if this is the case, are there sex
differences when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that there are fluctuations of
endocannabinoids across menstrual cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that even in women themselves,
if you just take them, that their
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids are going to be changing
over the course of that month,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least in pre-menopausal women.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't actually know very much about the
fluctuations in post-menopausal women.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, this is becoming an area of
interest, especially since a lot of women
[SPEAKER_01]: are turning to cannabinoid-based products
for perimenopausal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some documented studies
looking at the CB1 receptor in humans
[SPEAKER_01]: using imaging techniques and how those
receptors change over time and how there
[SPEAKER_01]: are differences as a function of sex and
age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're learning more about the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that some of the key studies
that have tried to understand differences
[SPEAKER_01]: in the endocannabinoid system between
males and females are a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: based off of the pharmacological studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding differences between males
and females in their response to THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: what are some of the hormonal modulation
of those differences of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that kind of gets at sex
differences in the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so let's talk about the effects of
cannabis and how they may differ.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are some of the key differences
that have been observed when comparing how
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis affects males and females?
[SPEAKER_01]: The key differences thus far that we know
of, again, I always like to turn back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the animal literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that is rooted in that one
paper that you first talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've learned a lot from the animal
literature with respect to how males and
[SPEAKER_01]: females might differ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're doing now in the human lab,
those people who study humans,
[SPEAKER_01]: volunteers in the laboratory, is we're
really trying to translate what's been
[SPEAKER_01]: observed in the animal studies and to see
if those effects are preserved or
[SPEAKER_01]: translated to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the key things that preclinical
researchers or animal researchers have
[SPEAKER_01]: found is that across the board,
female animals seem to be more sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: to THC's effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, THC has a lot of different effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting here is that
females seem to be sensitive to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: those different effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just one endpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be a number of different
endpoints.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, females appear to be more
sensitive to the pain relieving effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC compared to males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here again, we're talking about
animals here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Female animals are also more sensitive to
what we call abuse-related effects of THC
[SPEAKER_01]: and THC-like drugs compared to males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what's interesting in those animal
studies is that although there's clearly a
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity to THC and to THC-like
substances in female animals compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: males, what's interesting is that when you
give these groups of animals THC or
[SPEAKER_01]: THC-like substances, these drugs
repeatedly for many different days,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say for two weeks or three weeks,
what you see is that both groups do
[SPEAKER_01]: develop tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the effects of the THC will be lower
such that you'll need higher doses to
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve the same effect that you get with
that first day of drug administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's interesting is that among the
female animals, the tolerance is much more
[SPEAKER_01]: stark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the female seems to develop tolerance
at a much faster rate or at a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: magnitude than the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see something very similar in our
human studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go into that a little bit,
Ben, if you like, where what we've found,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is similar to the animal studies,
where females women will actually show a
[SPEAKER_01]: blunted analgesic response when exposed to
THC compared to men.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's interesting is that we see this
specifically in people that are using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis every day or almost every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're dealing with a population there
that is using cannabis on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And presumably, probably more tolerant to
THC's effects than let's say somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: who's using weekly or maybe bi-weekly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting also is that in that
group of people, we're not looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: people who have a chronic pain condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking to see in a normal,
healthy population, if we look at a pain
[SPEAKER_01]: response due to a painful stimulus,
will THC decrease that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it increase that pain response?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we see that pretty clearly in
males, but not in females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're building on that now to
understand how much does tolerance play a
[SPEAKER_01]: role in that effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do we see the same effect in people
that don't use cannabis every day or
[SPEAKER_01]: several times a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, to what degree do the hormones,
do female reproductive hormones play a
[SPEAKER_01]: role in differences here between the males
and the females?
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you mentioned animal studies versus
human studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you seeing a lot of the results in
the animal studies confirmed by human
[SPEAKER_02]: studies, or is there a departure there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So thus far, based off of the studies in
our laboratory, as well as other people's
[SPEAKER_01]: studies, it does seem like there's an
interesting kind of parity here between
[SPEAKER_01]: the animal studies and the human studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't always work out such that
what's observed in the animal world is
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily translated into humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a mouse is not a rat, is not a
non-human primate, is not a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a long chain of evolution here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it isn't always the case that what
we see in the rodent model is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: translated to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some really nice data
suggesting that there is some nice
[SPEAKER_01]: translation.
[SPEAKER_01]: between animals and humans here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of these areas is with respect to
how males and females metabolize THC
[SPEAKER_01]: differently and how pharmacokinetics and
the way that THC is metabolized or the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacokinetics of THC, we think probably
has a direct effect on its impact on
[SPEAKER_01]: physiology and behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody metabolizes THC very
quickly into metabolites that are
[SPEAKER_01]: inactive, then that plays a role in what
we're going to see on the behavioral
[SPEAKER_01]: endpoint, the physiological endpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's nice is that other labs,
so lab in Johns Hopkins with Ryan Bantry
[SPEAKER_01]: and Spindle and Scholar and others,
they've found in humans that females
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolize THC in a different way than
males in a very similar way that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: shown in animal studies as well,
where females will show higher levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: an active THC metabolite after a THC
administration compared to males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that active metabolite is
11-hydroxy-THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the group at Johns Hopkins also sees
this effect, where females will show
[SPEAKER_01]: greater 11-hydroxy-THC levels after being
exposed to THC compared to males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there have been some nice parallels
there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So males and females actually metabolize
THC differently?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so based off of animal studies and
based off of human studies, as far as we
[SPEAKER_01]: know right now, it does seem like they are
metabolizing the THC differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why are they metabolizing the THC
differently?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have to do with the metabolic
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be different in both the
animals and the humans with respect to
[SPEAKER_01]: males and females.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have to do with other aspects
that impact metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our lab, we're looking at differences
in how THC is metabolized or the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacopanetics of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between males and females to try and
understand why there might be a behavioral
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why is that males and females might
respond differently to THC on the pain
[SPEAKER_01]: relieving aspect of things, as well as
other aspects like mood-related effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: abuse-related effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also looking to see if maybe
some of these differences are due to
[SPEAKER_01]: differences in endocannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're drawing blood from women to
see if the differences that we see between
[SPEAKER_01]: males and females, if they're somewhat
associated with differences in baseline
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it our differences really rooted in
levels of female reproductive hormones,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is an interesting variable also
because in animal studies, there's data to
[SPEAKER_01]: suggest that estradiol plays a significant
role in the sensitivity to THC in female
[SPEAKER_01]: animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does seem like females reproductive
hormones do play a role in sensitivity to
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now how wide is the difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you say that females are more
sensitive or they metabolize THC
[SPEAKER_02]: differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it vastly different?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it slight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in science, we say significantly
different.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a sense of things, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we're probing this right now to
figure out what variables are underlying
[SPEAKER_01]: this effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that I mentioned
before, wherein our volunteers who are
[SPEAKER_01]: using cannabis daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, they're not medical cannabis
users are using for non-medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they come to our lab and we give
them cannabis with THC in it specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: not talking about other cannabinoids at
this point, when we give them cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: with THC and we look at the pain response
between males and females, essentially,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see a significant analgesic effect in
the males such that it's significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: different from placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you looked at the data, you'd say,
OK, the males in this group, the male
[SPEAKER_01]: volunteers in this group are getting some
pain relief here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at the females, the female
volunteers after smoking cannabis with THC
[SPEAKER_01]: in it essentially they look like they just
received placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So placebo cannabis with no THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's really no difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not getting any type of that pain
relieving effect of THC that the males are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that case, it is quite a stark
contrast between the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have and keep in mind, again,
these are people who are using cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we think that there's probably a
development of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The development of tolerance is probably
different between these two groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: The males and the females, as shown in
animal models or in animals, when you
[SPEAKER_01]: expose them to THC every day, the females
will show this robust tolerance to the
[SPEAKER_01]: pain relieving effects of THC that the
males show, but not as significant of an
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other aspects where we don't
necessarily see such a stark contrast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, among some of our female
volunteers, when we ask them how much they
[SPEAKER_01]: like the cannabis, what kind of good
effect they have, they'll rate that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as having a good effect to a
higher level than the males, the male
[SPEAKER_01]: volunteers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also, it's similar to what's
shown in the animal models, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: as stark of a difference as what we see on
the pain relieving end of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that depending on the end
point, depending on the person,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how much cannabis they've
been using and for what reason they've
[SPEAKER_01]: been using it, we'll probably see
differences in the magnitude of how much
[SPEAKER_01]: sex plays a role in cannabis' effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to take time to work out
what are some of the variables in play
[SPEAKER_01]: here, but it will be really important
information, I think, as more women are
[SPEAKER_01]: turning to cannabis for pain in this case,
for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding what can people expect with
respect to the dose that might be helpful,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mode of administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, we're just talking about inhaled
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens when they use it orally?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a very different metabolic
process that occurs when people are using
[SPEAKER_01]: THC orally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ultimately, the hope is that this
information will be helpful in informing
[SPEAKER_01]: people what they might expect when they
use THC and other cannabinoids for pain
[SPEAKER_01]: relief, both for the pain relief side,
but also potentially for some negative
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been shown, the group at Johns
Hopkins has shown that females might be
[SPEAKER_01]: more sensitive to the anxiety-provoking
aspects of THC, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's something important to
relate to the community as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that females might be more sensitive to
that aspect of cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I think that is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I want to talk about the
difference between animals and humans
[SPEAKER_02]: again, because correct me if I'm wrong,
but when you're measuring the effects of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in humans, a lot of it's
self-evident.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's self-reported, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the patient is telling the
researcher, yeah, it reduced my pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: or yeah, it gave me anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk a bit about the difference between
males and females and how they
[SPEAKER_02]: self-report, because when I spoke to Daddy
Mary on the podcast a while back,
[SPEAKER_02]: he observed that there was a difference,
that the females might be reporting more
[SPEAKER_02]: information or have more thoughtful
responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the males need a little bit more
prodding to get the information out of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you're hitting the hammer
on the nail of how important it is to do
[SPEAKER_01]: placebo-controlled studies, especially
when you're relying on something like
[SPEAKER_01]: self-report, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you do a placebo-controlled
study, what you can do is you're
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially looking, if it's what's called
a within-subject design, where the person
[SPEAKER_01]: is exposed to all the different drug
conditions so in the placebo-controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: study, they're exposed to the placebo drug
and they're also exposed to the active
[SPEAKER_01]: drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, let's say it would be
cannabis without THC and nothing else,
[SPEAKER_01]: our placebo cannabis, and then our
cannabis with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what you would do is you can
subtract out the placebo response from the
[SPEAKER_01]: active response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there, you're actually looking at
people as their own controls, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, females, they might show
differences with respect to their
[SPEAKER_01]: self-reported pain or their self-reported
anxiety or how good of a drug effect they
[SPEAKER_01]: have, but presumably they would have a
similar self-reporting behavior under the
[SPEAKER_01]: placebo situation as well or under the
very low cannabis dose, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our lab, we generally look at a couple
of different doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're able to kind of subtract out
that type of effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So animals are good test subjects,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't have to worry about if
they're blind to the dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really looking at objective
measures of behavior there that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: feel good about the data and say that
these are objective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about the animal
telling you things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, at the end of the
day, when you're talking about patients
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're talking about thinking about
how certain medicines might be helpful,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're thinking about symptoms and
disease states, it is so important that
[SPEAKER_01]: the patient can communicate to the
physician or to the scientist or the
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher about what it is they're
feeling, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when somebody talks about pain and the
objective measure of pain, to what level
[SPEAKER_01]: does this chronic pain patient have an
objective measure of pain versus what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're telling you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much pain are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much pain are they feeling right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're giving them a medicine to help
reduce their pain, hopefully you're really
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get at what they're telling you
they feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having an objective measure of pain is
important, but really their self-reported
[SPEAKER_01]: pain is really critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also understanding how that
self-reported pain might be impacting
[SPEAKER_01]: their quality of life or their daily
functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are other proxies that I
think are really important to address when
[SPEAKER_01]: doing randomized clinical trial of chronic
pain patients and understanding how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and cannabinoids might be
helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a range of end points there,
not just self-reported pain, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding how is that pain impacting
holistically their life from that lens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, yeah, because at the end of the
day, we're just trying to help people feel
[SPEAKER_02]: better, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I wanted to shift a little
bit and maybe talk about how males and
[SPEAKER_02]: females use different cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there much information around that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ben, I think that there are data and
I'm terrible, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't recall a good study that has
looked at how women are using cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products versus men and are there
differences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Inhaled cannabis, even though there are
lots of different products available now,
[SPEAKER_01]: inhaled cannabis is still the most popular
mode of administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: At a population level, but what we hear is
that from media sources and anecdotally is
[SPEAKER_01]: that females, women might be using oral
cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might gravitate towards those more
than inhaled for X, Y, and Z reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have a good paper to,
usually like I like to pull out those peer
[SPEAKER_01]: review publications and say this
researcher in this place demonstrated that
[SPEAKER_01]: females use this mode of administration
more than males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say though that as the cannabis
market is evolving, we are starting to see
[SPEAKER_01]: products that are available specifically
for medical indications in women,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of these products are geared,
the way that they're administered are
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically geared to females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can imagine some of those
different products that might be geared
[SPEAKER_01]: more towards females that don't really
aren't relevant for males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't necessarily know the rates of
use of these types of products among
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be interesting to see over
the long term, as there becomes some
[SPEAKER_01]: generalizability with respect to what's
available across states, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now, states are functioning
very differently and there's one product
[SPEAKER_01]: that's available in California,
but it's not available in New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think over time, as the dust settles and
there is some continuity between the types
[SPEAKER_01]: of products that are available across
states, it will be interesting to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: types of products females are using,
what are they using them for compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: males?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do the motives or the reasons for
use differ between males and females?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as an example, there's certain health
indications or medical issues that are
[SPEAKER_01]: more prevalent among females than males,
for example, fibromyalgia, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So more females have fibromyalgia than
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what type of products are those
patients drawn to?
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't talked about cannabidiol yet,
but we have a study here at UCLA that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: working on with a principal investigator
who is really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her name is Vena Ranganath, and she's a
rheumatologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a study looking at cannabidiol
for rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're finding is that,
as expected, we have a lot of females in
[SPEAKER_01]: that study, just because rheumatoid
arthritis occurs at a higher frequency
[SPEAKER_01]: among females than males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's an example of over time,
we're going to see how different males and
[SPEAKER_01]: females might differ with respect to their
reasons for cannabis use, as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: type of cannabinoid they're using and the
mode of administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The conversation has been centered a lot
around THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we know about the other
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there sex differences there as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even in the preclinical literature,
right now, Ben, this is an area that is so
[SPEAKER_01]: new.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, the one or two studies
that have looked at cannabidiol and sex
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent effects in animals, they haven't
really found stark differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that there's been a study
comparing males and females with respect
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabidiol, inhaled cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this was our colleagues at Johns
Hopkins, that show that females might be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more sensitive to how the drug
makes them feel, how cannabidiol makes
[SPEAKER_01]: them feel compared to males.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is just kind of the tip of the
iceberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabidiol, understanding how males and
females differ in their response to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about some of the other cannabinoids
that people are using now?
[SPEAKER_01]: People are being drawn to, for example,
cannabigerol, CBG, CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing in California,
you know, CBN is becoming more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think that CBN might be helpful for
sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there sex dependent effects with
CBN?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we're starting to see an
emerging market of cannabis based products
[SPEAKER_01]: that have specific terpenes in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are there sex dependent effects
with terpenes too?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth is, is that it's hard for me
to hypothesize if there will be a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference, because even in animal studies
right now, there haven't really been good
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts to understand if there is a sex
dependent effect, in part because the
[SPEAKER_01]: studies on those cannabis constituents are
kind of just starting also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think that preclinical
researchers are now just trying to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: hold of what do these terpenes do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do these minor cannabinoids do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to try and delve into,
you know, are there differences between
[SPEAKER_01]: males and females?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of work being done in
this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there is a lot of attention
being paid to how sex can impact the
[SPEAKER_01]: biological effects, physiological effects,
effects in the central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over time, I think we'll get a better
picture of, you know, what's happening as
[SPEAKER_01]: a function of sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, you know, we didn't talk
about sex versus gender, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that's also a really important
topic that as scientists, the scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: community as a whole, I think we're just
kind of waking up to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding, does gender, how somebody,
you know, defines their gender,
[SPEAKER_01]: not sex as a biological variable,
but gender, you know, can that also impact
[SPEAKER_01]: how people use cannabis and cannabinoids
and what the outcomes might be?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think over time as well,
we're going to see some nice data in that
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically because I think that the
funding agencies are starting to pay more
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this idea that, you know,
there can be sex-dependent effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs, you know, we're able to really look
at this in part because there is funding
[SPEAKER_01]: available to study it, because there's
clearly an interest and need for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's also funding from federal
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, you know, the NIH is becoming
very interested in gender as well as sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be, you know, interesting to see
how the story unfolds over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been trying to be precise in my
language and say sex and male and female,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I did want to, you know, ask the
question too that, you know, we've talked
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot about the biological differences and
are there cultural differences that could
[SPEAKER_02]: be playing a role here and that would sort
of factor into gender identity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, we think about
sociocultural differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could take, you know,
the United States as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even with respect to, you know,
what jurisdiction you happen to live in
[SPEAKER_01]: and if that jurisdiction has cannabis
dispensaries, is there a perception of
[SPEAKER_01]: stigma around cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that will also, you know,
impact what people are using and how
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using it, how open they are with
their physicians to talk about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: or are they in a place where there's
dispensaries on every block, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, just in and of itself,
like, you know, where you are
[SPEAKER_01]: geographically, who you are socializing
with, what is your family like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's your occupation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All these different aspects are going to
feed into, you know, who is using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, for what reason, and what are
some of the health and social outcomes of
[SPEAKER_01]: their use of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it be helpful or will they feel like
their, you know, their use is stigmatized
[SPEAKER_01]: and will it have to be done, you know,
secretly for whatever reason, or are they
[SPEAKER_01]: scared of law enforcement?
[SPEAKER_01]: All these different things, I think,
are going to go into over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what is the impact of cannabis
use on health outcomes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of things to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Ziva, before I let you go,
I want to give you a chance to mention any
[SPEAKER_02]: other papers or resources that you could
share with the audience if they want to
[SPEAKER_02]: read more or, and then for you personally,
if there's social media or a website that
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd like to plug, please let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, thank you so much for the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I would just like to plug,
we talked a little bit about this in the
[SPEAKER_01]: very beginning, was, you know,
the importance of looking at age as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that there has been a really
sharp increase in cannabis use among the
[SPEAKER_01]: older population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know very little about the impact
of, you know, the pharmacopanetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacodynamic effects of cannabis in the
older population, just because they
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't necessarily been studied very
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so understanding, you know,
the effects, the potential therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: effects, potential risks associated with
cannabis use in that older population,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also as a function of age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said before, we know from animal
studies that, you know, reproductive
[SPEAKER_01]: hormones play a role in THC's effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what happens, you know, when we
reach an age where, you know, circulating
[SPEAKER_01]: hormones change drastically, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically in women who are
perimenopausal or postmenopausal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at UCLA, we have a grant to
actually look at this question that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: really excited to look at, not just,
you know, inhaled cannabis with THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also look at oral THC administration
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to try and understand, you know,
differences across mode of administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're really excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just to plug for our center
at UCLA, so the University of California,
[SPEAKER_01]: Los Angeles, we have a center for cannabis
and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that center, we have our lab that does
control drug administration studies,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we also study cannabis from a public
health perspective, public policy
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really wonderful center.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, feel free to look us up,
UCLA Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, we have a Twitter
handle as well, although we're not that
[SPEAKER_01]: good about keeping up with it,
but it's UCLA Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much, Ben, for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a really wonderful conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really enjoyed talking with you
and we'll put links to all those resources
[SPEAKER_02]: that you mentioned in the show description
so it's easy for folks to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, thanks again, Ziva.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been great and hope to see you
out in Can Med.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
