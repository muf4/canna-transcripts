[SPEAKER_00]: like compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summarized by Pacher and Kunos to
researchers at NIH in Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have published that modulated
endocannabinoid activity may have
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic potential in almost all
diseases affecting humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt whether we can say this about any
other system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason that many,
many groups look at the activity of
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids or of the plant
cannabinoids from various aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have worked on three different
phases, types of cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is on the plant cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second one is the endocannabinoid,
anandamide-N2AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently, over the last few
years, in additional anandamide-like
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started work on the plant
cannabinoids, essentially only two
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds had been isolated, cannabidiol
and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid had also been seen,
but I'm not sure that cannabinoid is a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, cannabidiol, as you can see here,
and THC are very closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have essentially the same structure,
except the THC has three rings,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol has only two rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're completely, completely
different in their activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: While THC, as we well know, causes the
effects that everybody associates with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, cannabidiol essentially is a
compound that is being used today for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long list of medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, the plant actually doesn't
synthesize either THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It synthesizes their precursors,
their acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant synthesizes cannabidiolic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It synthesizes tetrahydrocannabinolic
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, there are two acids,
there are two THC acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, and this depends on the
position of the carboxyl group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the carboxyl group, here is the
carboxyl group, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these compounds are not stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They slowly convert into cannabidiol from
cannabidiolic acid or THC from THC acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these compounds have not been
investigated very thoroughly because they
[SPEAKER_00]: are not stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And scientists don't like to work with
unstable product because we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the effects seen are due to the
compound itself or to a degradation
[SPEAKER_00]: product in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able recently to stabilize CBD
acid by making a methyl ester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is putting a methyl group on the
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been able to look at the
activity of this acid derivative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together with the Canadian group,
we found that it reduces depression in two
[SPEAKER_00]: animal models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lowers pain with another Canadian
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this particular compound, which is
present in quite large amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis, in the plant, is of
considerable interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assume that it will be used for one
of these effects that we see, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: depression or whether it's pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the work that has been published,
actually, is of course not on DS,
[SPEAKER_00]: but on cannabidiol itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not go into details.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hundreds of papers on CBD
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it works on inflammation and
epilepsy, on diabetes type 1, on
[SPEAKER_00]: graft-versus-cold disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few works on epilepsy we did in
collaboration with the group in South
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some initially work on mice and rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that it is pretty active in
models of epilepsy in these animal models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went into a clinical study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 15 epileptic patients that were not
being helped by the existing drugs at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They received 200 to 300 milligrams per
day of cannabidiol for quite a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: four and a half months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my colleagues in South America found
that four patients out of eight remained
[SPEAKER_00]: completely fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only three of seizures, three patients had
partial improvement, and only one patient
[SPEAKER_00]: had no improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the placebo patients, of course,
we saw essentially no change.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was published, as you can see the
date here, about 40 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nothing happened for nearly 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have helped a lot of epileptic
patients over these 30 years, but about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: or 12 years ago, additional groups got
interested, and a major clinical trial was
[SPEAKER_00]: done by a British company.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trial was done in the US, and they
found that it is indeed very active in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain epilepsy states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now CBD has been approved as a drug
for certain epileptic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also mentioned graft-versus-host
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is actually a disease caused by
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain diseases where a bone
marrow transplant is needed, and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: very helpful in certain cancer diseases,
but it may cause problems the bone marrow
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant can attack the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body can attack the bone marrow,
and the patient is sick, at times very
[SPEAKER_00]: sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: A colleague of mine, Dr. Yeshorun at one
of the hospitals, here administered CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: to, as you can see here, 46 patients that
had a bone marrow transplant, and he filed
[SPEAKER_00]: them for several months, and he saw very,
very substantial improvement, and they had
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially no graft-versus-host disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suppose that cannabidiol will become
a drug not only for epilepsy, but also for
[SPEAKER_00]: graft-versus-host disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, probably quite a few
other diseases as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part about THC, again, I will not go into
detail, but basically what THC does,
[SPEAKER_00]: it lowers pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is used and approved actually for
nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with sleep, and many of those
patients that take THC actually take it in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to improve sleep or to make sleep
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: At low doses, it is an anti-anxiety
compound, but as we all know, at high
[SPEAKER_00]: doses, we can see completely different
effects, and it also increases appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for nearly 20 years since we reported
the structures of these compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: structures which were not known
previously, for 20 or 25 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a lot of pharmacological work on
these two compounds, and we learned from
[SPEAKER_00]: them a lot about the effects of
cannabinoids, and hundreds of papers were
[SPEAKER_00]: published on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that we did not know for many
years was the mechanism of action of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does THC act?
[SPEAKER_00]: A group in the US in the 80s found that
there is a specific cannabinoid receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: in the brain, and this specific
cannabinoid receptor in the brain is found
[SPEAKER_00]: in brain areas that are really typical for
the effect that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is found in the basal ganglia that has
a lot to do with movement control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been found in the cerebellum,
in the April campus, in the cerebral
[SPEAKER_00]: cortex, and as a matter of fact,
this particular receptor, CB1,
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of the major receptors that we see
in the brain, in our body, not only in the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we assume that if there is a
receptor, it is not there because a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: produces THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assume that our body produces compounds
which activate this receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some peculiar reason, a plant compound
binds to the same receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we worked for quite a few years,
actually, and we found in 1992,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 20 years ago, 25 years ago,
we found a new compound, which we call the
[SPEAKER_00]: nanobytes, that has a structure which is
completely different from that of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, this compound binds to the receptor,
today known as the CB1 receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the same extent as
tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years later, we found the second
compound, which is closely related to
[SPEAKER_00]: nanobytes, and it also binds to the
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two compounds have been investigated
thoroughly by many, many groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these two compounds, as I mentioned
previously, are involved in a large number
[SPEAKER_00]: of biological systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are part of, today we know,
of the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: which consists of two receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second receptor was found a few years
later than the previous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are the two main major compounds,
anandamide and 2AG, that I showed you the
[SPEAKER_00]: structures previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few other compounds found in
lower amounts, which have not been
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated thoroughly, but it seems that
these two compounds, which we discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 1990s, anandamide and 2AG,
they are the main compounds involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the enzymes that synthesize
endocannabinoids and the enzymes that
[SPEAKER_00]: cause the hydrolysis of the
endocannabinoids, so the compounds and the
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme today are known as the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, THC and cannabidiol are closely
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are the effects that we see that
are due to the cannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know today, and there are lots of
publications and I possibly can have a few
[SPEAKER_00]: more slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving a few of the effect that
we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This system is involved in anxiety and
appetite and all these that you can see in
[SPEAKER_00]: this slide, mood, movement,
neuroprotection, pain, stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just give a few examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neuroprotection.
[SPEAKER_00]: In collaboration with a colleague of mine,
Professor Shahami, we tried to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in the brain after damage,
not a major damage, but a small amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that after such a damage,
the brain of the mouse produces 2 AG in
[SPEAKER_00]: very large amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the red ball,
which you can compare with the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge amounts of 2 AG are synthesized by
the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the brain produce 2 AG because it has
been damaged and doesn't know what it
[SPEAKER_00]: does, or is the production of 2 AG
actually a protective response,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps, by the brain?
[SPEAKER_00]: We synthesized large amounts of 2 AG and
gave it to mice that had undergone brain
[SPEAKER_00]: damage and compared it to mice that had
not undergone that damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that 2 AG, when administered to the
mice, lowers the damage seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can look at the brains of mice
that have received 2 AG compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: control animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that the damage in the controls
is 50% higher than those that received 2
[SPEAKER_00]: AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are that at some point,
I hope some company will develop 2 AG as a
[SPEAKER_00]: compound against brain damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe that we have any drugs in
this area at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that there are two receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them, the CB1, when THC or
anandamide bind to the CB1 receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: they lead to those effects that we know
are associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2, by contrast, doesn't do all these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CB2 receptor seems to be a protective
one, a receptor that when stimulated
[SPEAKER_00]: actually leads to protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The protection can be in various areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are papers on protection of heart
problems, atherosclerosis, stroke,
[SPEAKER_00]: liver fibrosis, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm under the impression that several of
the major companies are working on
[SPEAKER_00]: specific CB2 receptor compounds for
specific diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We and many others have published
compounds which act on the CB2 receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are two examples from my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is HU308, which you can see
binds very well to the CB2 receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but does not bind to the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the second compound, which is a
different one, which is HU910,
[SPEAKER_00]: binds to the CB2 receptor extremely well
and rather poorly to the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: In brain injury, we see quite a lot of
different types of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: One type has to do with glutamate,
cytokines, reactive oxygen intermediates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these can lead to cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another type of damage is
vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested 2AG to see whether it has to do
with vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned 2AG because we saw in one of
the previous slides that 2AG is helpful in
[SPEAKER_00]: brain damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, indeed, it helps with
vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lowers the vasoconstriction in the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, and we were surprised really,
however, the total extract of the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: was much better than 2AG alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we assumed maybe we have another
compound, much more active compound than
[SPEAKER_00]: 2AG, which works on the vasoconstriction,
vasodilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a student of mine, he did his PhD on
this topic, looked for compounds or a
[SPEAKER_00]: compound that is better than 2AG in
vasodilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after quite a few years of work,
we were able to identify a compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: the compound, the structure that we
isolated and dilucidated the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is arachidonyl serine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very close to anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both compounds are derivatives of
arachidonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is the arachidonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are bind to, in this case,
ethanolamine, and in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same, but with a carboxyl
group here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially the same compound as
anandamide, but arachidonyl serine does
[SPEAKER_00]: not bind to the receptors and is much more
potent than anandamide in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the three compounds,
the anandamide, the 2AG, and RAS,
[SPEAKER_00]: arachidonyl serine, RAS, very closely
related, but they have different
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned head trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at a few additional compounds
present in the brain that may act on brain
[SPEAKER_00]: trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that RAS, as I mentioned the
RAS previously, is pretty good in lowering
[SPEAKER_00]: brain trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is as active as 2AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, two very closely related
compounds also present in the brain are
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially inactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular compound, RAS,
arachidonyl serine, that I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: possesses vasoactive and neuroprotective
properties resembling those of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned again, it does not bind
to the cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how these things work
together, as I believe the neuroprotection
[SPEAKER_00]: with the cannabinoids, with the
anandamide, has to do with the CB1 and
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2, but RAS does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we may have two different
mechanisms leading to the same type of
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go to another field which
cannabinoids are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been published, and there are
several papers on this, that in Greece,
[SPEAKER_00]: Greek peasants seem to have less
osteoporosis
[SPEAKER_00]: than peasants in other places,
in the north, in Norway, in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to know why this happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the bone contains a
compound, it is also present in the brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: allyl serine, which promotes osteoclast
apoptosis and increases bone formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bones we have do not stay the way they
are throughout our life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are broken down all the time by cells
called osteoclasts, and they are at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time being rebuilt by osteoblasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain diseases, osteoporosis,
for example, the osteoclasts work
[SPEAKER_00]: overtime, if you wish, and the osteoblasts
cannot promote enough bone formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If allyl serine was found to lower the
effect of osteoclast, it causes apoptosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in this way, there is less breaking
down of the bone and more bone formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here again, this is
anandamide, and here is the allyl serine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which acts on bones and which causes a
lowering of the effect of the osteoclast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it seems to be pretty good in
osteoporosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another colleague of mine, the late
Professor Baab, looked at the activity of
[SPEAKER_00]: allyl serine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He caused osteoporosis and
osteoporosis-like disease by causing
[SPEAKER_00]: ovariectomy in female mice, and indeed,
if one causes ovariectomy and looks at the
[SPEAKER_00]: mice after about 40 days, we see that the
bones are the bone content goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we start giving allyl serine at
this point, we can see now that the bones
[SPEAKER_00]: do not continue breaking down,
as a matter of fact, recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most of the drugs that we have for
osteoporosis nowadays usually just stop
[SPEAKER_00]: the disease, or they stop to a certain
extent the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few of the drugs, if any at all,
cause the formation of the bone again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are quite a few diseases known that
are closely related to osteoporosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a disease called Prader-Willi
syndrome, which causes bone abnormalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are closely related to osteoporosis,
of course, the Prader-Willi syndrome has a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of other effects, but I'm speaking of
the bones alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was found that in Prader-Willi
syndrome, the body produces lower amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: of allyl serine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when my colleague, Yossi Tam,
who is a specialist in this area,
[SPEAKER_00]: started to administrate allyl serine to
animals that have the Prader-Willi
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome, they most definitely caused
enhancement of bone formation and
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement of the bone disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all these compounds I mentioned,
all these anandamide-like compounds I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, are not very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them are amides that can be
attacked by amidases, and therefore,
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt whether they can be used as drugs
on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we prepared a few derivatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we'll go into the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is H6-7-1, in which the amide
bond is kind of protected, and the enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: does not attack it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easily protected, as in the compounds
I mentioned, allyl serine, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, the 6-7-8 exhibits high
efficacy, reversing the osteoporosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is active in the Prader-Willi
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me move to another field.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the major problems we have in
medicine today is that many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes we have are antibiotic-resistant,
and if we cannot overcome this major
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, we should probably be back as if
we were in the 1930s with microbes that we
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot attack by antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to see whether our body has a way
to work against this microbial resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and after quite a lot of work,
which was done in the lab of Professor
[SPEAKER_00]: Thalberg in collaboration, we found that
methicillin, an antibiotic, against which
[SPEAKER_00]: certain streptococci, have become
resistant, we can enhance the activity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the antibiotic if we give the antibiotic
together with anandamide or Arra-S,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same compound I mentioned previously,
Arra-Hedonoyl serine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that Arra-S really can
overcome the microbial resistance of these
[SPEAKER_00]: particular microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking at many additional microbes
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at additional compounds,
but this may be a very promising field or
[SPEAKER_00]: promising way of overcoming microbial
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here again is anandamide, 2-AG,
and Arra-S, which I mentioned previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does Arra-S do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when microbes are attacked by an
antibiotic, one of the ways they can
[SPEAKER_00]: resist is by producing a biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Millions of microbes get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They form a biofilm, which is not attacked
by the antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arra-S prevents the biofilm formation
by altering the surface of the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: without actually killing the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me end with a completely different
field, the field of nicotine addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a few people that smoke cigarettes
or other types of tobacco become addicted
[SPEAKER_00]: to nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this addiction causes them to smoke,
although they know that smoking is not
[SPEAKER_00]: good for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to see whether our body has
a way of preventing, lowering this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: disaddiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a paper in the literature that
the person who was involved in a traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: accident and was addicted to nicotine
after the traffic accident, which he had a
[SPEAKER_00]: brain trauma, he was not addicted anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought maybe, just maybe,
the brain is producing a compound that
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks the addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we looked forward and we found the
compound, which again is very closely
[SPEAKER_00]: related to an endomite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a fatty acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a fatty acid bound to this part
here, to this forming an amide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a colleague of ours in Canada went
ahead looking whether this compound
[SPEAKER_00]: indeed, you know, those models of
addiction is active.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, and I want to stress
this again, I mentioned several times that
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my work is done in collaboration with
friends and colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, in the field of addiction,
we are a group of four labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to my own lab, a lab in the
UK, a lab in the US, a lab in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lab in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lab in Italy actually found the
compound from a brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the group in Canada worked on the
addiction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Parker, a Canadian, looked at the
conditional preference in an animal model
[SPEAKER_00]: of addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conditional preference is a relatively
simple way of measuring addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mice or rats are given the option to go to
food with, or go to food with nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning, they go 50% to one part
of, to the nicotine-containing food,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 50% to the food that does not contain
nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, after some days or probably some
weeks, they are addicted to the nicotine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and almost all of them go to the nicotine
with food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called conditional place
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Linda Parker in Canada found that if
we give the compound we discovered in the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain, the mice do not get addicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that the conditional place
preference works absolutely in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought it might work also with
opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were kind of disappointed to see
that only glycine does not work with
[SPEAKER_00]: opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, surprisingly, it was both a
nicotine and opiate withdrawal responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that animals, of course,
humans that are addicted can undergo
[SPEAKER_00]: withdrawal responses, which sometimes are
very, very unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that only glycine eliminates
both nicotine and opiate withdrawal
[SPEAKER_00]: responses, which is kind of strange
because only glycine does not work on
[SPEAKER_00]: opiate addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turned out that the withdrawal and
the addiction, there are two different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we know that only glycine works
on nicotine addiction, does not work on
[SPEAKER_00]: opiate addiction, but it works on nicotine
and opiate withdrawal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is what Linda Parker wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morphine withdrawal reactions were
accompanied by suppressed endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of only glycine in different parts
of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only glycine is again an amide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned before, amides can be
easily attacked by amidases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to, again, try to suppress
this enzyme reaction by having a metal
[SPEAKER_00]: group not far from the amide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we synthesize the compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is oleol glycine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an oleol glycine with a metal
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes alanine, oleol alanine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this compound turned out to be more
active for a longer period than oleol
[SPEAKER_00]: glycine itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found that oleol alanine is not only
more stable, but it's also more potent
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-withdrawal molecule than oleol
glycine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the impression that this
compound may or should become a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I mentioned before, on the basis
of what I've been telling you,
[SPEAKER_00]: we assume that the exogenous
administration of oleol glycine or oleol
[SPEAKER_00]: alanine may be beneficial for the
prevention of nicotine addiction and
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine and opiate withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me summarize what I've been
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoids are involved in a
large number of physiological processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And THC which is a plant cannabinoid just
mimics their actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD derivatives may lead to wide spectrum
of novel drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endocannabinoid-like compounds may lead to
better understanding of biological
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, as well as novel drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CB2-specific avenues may lead to a
wide spectrum of novel drugs, maybe part
[SPEAKER_00]: of a general protective system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank my collaborators in
Israel these are fellows in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many other labs or the
professors in Jerusalem that I
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned my work with Professor Bob,
Professor Shohami, and some in other
[SPEAKER_00]: academic institutes in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work with a lot of collaborators
abroad from the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Aberdeen, Roger Pertwee, you can see
the names of many of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank them and I thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
