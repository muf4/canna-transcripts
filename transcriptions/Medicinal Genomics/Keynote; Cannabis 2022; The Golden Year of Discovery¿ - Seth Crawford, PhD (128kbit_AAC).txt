[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope we are ready to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Seth Crawford.
[SPEAKER_05]: My brother and I co-founded Oregon CBD in
2015.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're Oregon's oldest continually
operating hemp farm and the nation's
[SPEAKER_05]: leading supplier of feminized cannabis
seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was here last in 2018, I delivered
a presentation about the promise and
[SPEAKER_05]: potential of developing non-THC varieties
grown as hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: This work can be seen as an extension of
the well-documented breeding program
[SPEAKER_05]: published by ITN de Meyer at GW
Pharmaceuticals, which is itself the
[SPEAKER_05]: culmination of work started at Horta Farm
in the Netherlands by Dave Watson and Rob
[SPEAKER_05]: Clark in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our intent was not to just develop clones
with novel chemotypes like Horta Farm did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rather, the goal was to produce
field-ready F1 versions that would allow
[SPEAKER_05]: farmers to maximize their yields in a way
that brought these cannabinoids into the
[SPEAKER_05]: mainstream.
[SPEAKER_05]: We set out to accomplish that task by
applying classical plant breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: strategies to cannabis, isolating
individuals and self-pollinating through
[SPEAKER_05]: multiple inbred generations in hopes of
attaining higher rates of homozygosity,
[SPEAKER_05]: fixing chemical composition, enabling
uniform flowering responses in our
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrids, and attempting to maximize
heterosis through careful selection of
[SPEAKER_05]: final parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been engaged in the project for
about eight years now and can report that
[SPEAKER_05]: the first phase is complete.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have CBD, CBDV, CBG, and CBGV parental
stock of inbred photoperiod and
[SPEAKER_05]: day-neutral lines developed for hybrid F1
seed production.
[SPEAKER_05]: The results of this approach have yielded
commercial varieties that set the
[SPEAKER_05]: benchmark for both field productivity and
total cannabinoid content in university
[SPEAKER_05]: field trials across the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Concurrently, they've ushered in a new era
where non-psychoactive trim flowers can
[SPEAKER_05]: actually compete on par with their THC
counterparts for consumer attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Farmers have received over 40 different
awards with their varieties around the US,
[SPEAKER_05]: including a really cool landmark win at
the Cultivation Classic in 2020 by Horn
[SPEAKER_05]: Creek Hemp, taking the blind-tasting
flagship category of most credible
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivar with our CBD-dominant Sour Space
Candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This beat out a field dominated by THC
specimens because of its consistently
[SPEAKER_05]: relaxing and positive effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a small R&D operation with an
oversized influence on the hemp market,
[SPEAKER_05]: in large part due to our attention to
detail in the breeding process and our
[SPEAKER_05]: desire to collaborate with other
scientists to better our collective
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding of this incredible plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've built out facilities that include
over 275,000 square feet of
[SPEAKER_05]: next-generation indoor greenhouse space,
600 isolation tents for controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: crosses, a tissue culture, employee
manipulation lab, whole genome sequencing,
[SPEAKER_05]: and molecular lab capabilities,
and full chemical analysis at our little
[SPEAKER_05]: 49-acre farm in Independence, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've basically been lucky enough to build
a professional life that the 20-year-old
[SPEAKER_05]: version of ourselves couldn't have dreamed
up and were tremendously thankful to have
[SPEAKER_05]: been born in the right place at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knew that a couple kids raised in an
electricity-less log cabin in the woods of
[SPEAKER_05]: southern Oregon would get such an amazing
opportunity?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, big thanks to mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also like to thank the entire CanMed
event team for hosting what is,
[SPEAKER_05]: to me, the most outstanding cannabis
conference in the country, and thank all
[SPEAKER_05]: of you for taking the time to listen
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of the best and brightest minds in
the cannabis space are here, and we're all
[SPEAKER_05]: very lucky to get first-hand accounts of
the work being accomplished right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also like to thank everybody on our
whole team at Oregon CBD, past,
[SPEAKER_05]: present, and future, for their
contributions to the work that's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be discussed today, and say thanks to all
of our collaborators over the past few
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's too many to mention right now,
but they're going to be acknowledged
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout this presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the title of today's talk is phrased
as a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2022, the golden year of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Full disclosure, it had been 2020,
the golden year of cannabis, and then a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple years of epidemiological history
got in our way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to address the question at the
outset so everybody's able to concentrate
[SPEAKER_05]: on the rest of the talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this is the golden year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year was too, and the year before
that, and next year probably be as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be true regardless of your
worldview, whether the glass is truly
[SPEAKER_05]: half-full or totally empty.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as we can grow for another season
and build on what we collectively learned
[SPEAKER_05]: last year, it's always going to be the
golden year.
[SPEAKER_05]: All dialectical meanderings aside,
we do stand at an absolutely sublime
[SPEAKER_05]: moment in time for cannabis research,
in no small part due to the rise of hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: The general framework for today includes a
brief overview of that program,
[SPEAKER_05]: a more in-depth dive into the use of
ploidy manipulation as a breeding tool,
[SPEAKER_05]: with triploids as the primary example,
and finally, we'll finish up with some
[SPEAKER_05]: thoughts about the next phases,
double entendre there on purpose,
[SPEAKER_05]: genomics and plants that will push our
industry forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be ample time at the end
for both public questions, and we do have
[SPEAKER_05]: a break conveniently scheduled afterwards,
so if it doesn't get addressed in the
[SPEAKER_05]: public comment section, please come find
me at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to answer anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp timeline.
[SPEAKER_05]: So industrial hemp was federally legalized
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: via the 2014 Farm Bill passed in December
of that year with a maximum allowable THC
[SPEAKER_05]: limit of 0.3% or less.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the late passage, many states took a
number of months to adopt conforming
[SPEAKER_05]: policies and start issuing licenses to
growers, making 2016 the first production
[SPEAKER_05]: year in any meaningful sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: A strange patchwork of state-enforced
rules were the name of the game from then
[SPEAKER_05]: until this year, which is the first to be
conducted under final USDA rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: These gray market area years led to
variable sampling methodologies,
[SPEAKER_05]: compliance test timing, and reporting
requirements across the country,
[SPEAKER_05]: with significant confusion amongst
regulators and farmers alike, occasionally
[SPEAKER_05]: leading to whole crop destruction when
plants tested over the THC threshold.
[SPEAKER_05]: As has been established by many,
this THC limit is demonstrably arbitrary
[SPEAKER_05]: and not grounded in science, but that's
what we have to work with until Congress
[SPEAKER_05]: updates the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: The biggest watershed moment on this
timeline occurs at the end of 2018 with
[SPEAKER_05]: passage of the most recent Farm Bill,
which did away with the research pilot
[SPEAKER_05]: aspect of the original law and placed
fully legalized hemp production in the U
[SPEAKER_05]: .S.
[SPEAKER_05]: under the jurisdiction of the USDA moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: USDA issued an interim final rule for
producers on Halloween of 2019,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is definitely a scare, proposed that
sampling occur within six days of harvest
[SPEAKER_05]: and be taken from the top two inches of
terminal flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, no economically valuable CBD
varieties that were being grown in the U
[SPEAKER_05]: .S.
[SPEAKER_05]: at that time would pass testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The public comment period was intense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Farmers were pissed, and luckily,
this time around, we had some help from
[SPEAKER_05]: universities studying the crop for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: After reviewing public feedback and
coordinating with other affected federal
[SPEAKER_05]: agencies, USDA concretized the final,
final rules on January 19th, 2021.
[SPEAKER_05]: These require that all states with hemp
programs submit a control plan for USDA
[SPEAKER_05]: approval, which most have completed at
this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would-be producers in states without
formal programs are able to apply for a
[SPEAKER_05]: license directly from the USDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: The final rules made compliance sampling
much more uniform nationally with a 28-day
[SPEAKER_05]: pre-harvest window instituted and a
sampling protocol that calls for the top
[SPEAKER_05]: five to eight inches of the main female
cola.
[SPEAKER_05]: While some variability still exists from
state to state and from sampler to
[SPEAKER_05]: sampler, it's been tamped down
substantially through this harmonization
[SPEAKER_05]: process.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a parallel effort, the National
Institutes for Standards and Testing
[SPEAKER_05]: started a voluntary program for cannabis
testing labs in May of 2019 called the
[SPEAKER_05]: CANA QAP, or Cannabis Quality Assurance
Program.
[SPEAKER_05]: The goal of this program is to establish
uniformity in analytical measurement
[SPEAKER_05]: through distributed testing of material
with known cannabinoid profiles and
[SPEAKER_05]: publicly releasing the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Taken together, it's clear to see that
federal agencies are preparing for
[SPEAKER_05]: national legalization, and hemp is serving
as the test case.
[SPEAKER_05]: From 2020 on, a number of previously
unavailable cannabinoids entered the
[SPEAKER_05]: marketplace, so Delta-8 THC, Delta-10 THC,
THCO, hydrogenated cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can name it, enterprising chemists
with varying levels of skill and equipment
[SPEAKER_05]: were making it out of hemp-derived
precursors.
[SPEAKER_05]: While there's been significant
consternation about the safety of these
[SPEAKER_05]: products, largely due to residual
contaminants and unknown compounds being
[SPEAKER_05]: generated in the conversion process,
movements by individual states to rein in
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially intoxicating hemp derivatives
have really been met by a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: permissiveness with the federal response.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last note on this timeline directly
addresses these new compounds and
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially any other product made from
cannabis grown as hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: On January 6th of this year, the DEA sent
a policy determination letter to a hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: product manufacturer that clearly stated
the agency does not have enforcement
[SPEAKER_05]: authority over hemp in any way,
including Delta-8 THC derived from the
[SPEAKER_05]: isomerization of CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this obviously has significant
implications.
[SPEAKER_05]: Production of hemp over this same period
of time underwent a absolutely meteoric
[SPEAKER_05]: ascent, peaking in the summer of 2019.
[SPEAKER_05]: Following passage of the new farm bill,
overproduction ensued, prices plummeted,
[SPEAKER_05]: and an action by the FDA created a
cacophony of doubt amongst established
[SPEAKER_05]: product manufacturers over the future of
hemp-derived cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: The initial rapid expansion in production
was met with an equally precipitous
[SPEAKER_05]: decline in total acres registered and farm
gate prices, to the point where it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: economical to grow for most farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Biomass prices, so this is the floral
material destined for extraction,
[SPEAKER_05]: bottomed out around 50 cents per pound
earlier this year and are slowly creeping
[SPEAKER_05]: up as a tremendous glut of material
finally starts to dissipate.
[SPEAKER_05]: The trimmed hemp flower market is still
holding on, but is a very small proportion
[SPEAKER_05]: of the total acres planted each year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Registered acres, as you can see,
in 2022 are currently estimated to be
[SPEAKER_05]: slightly more than 2017, but still quite a
bit less than 2018.
[SPEAKER_05]: The few farmers who have held on over the
last three years are desperately hoping
[SPEAKER_05]: for a solid price rebound, but at this
point, who really knows what's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: transpire?
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, the tendency of boom and bust
cycles with recently opened cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: markets is a stark reminder that
efficiency, marketability, and novelty are
[SPEAKER_05]: all mandatory for growers to simply stay
in business.
[SPEAKER_05]: The silver lining here, despite the market
collapse, is that hemp, viewed as a
[SPEAKER_05]: vehicle for research, has absolutely
exploded during this production collapse
[SPEAKER_05]: as universities join industry in their
ability to handle the plant in a
[SPEAKER_05]: relatively uninhibited way.
[SPEAKER_05]: A key regulatory, scientific, and
practical farming question has been where
[SPEAKER_05]: does residual THC come from in type 3 and
type 4 plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: The question was of critical importance
while the USDA was proposing rules for the
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp industry, as their initial versions
would have essentially ended CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: production, and we believe in this case
that some good science actually affected
[SPEAKER_05]: national policy for once.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know free and co-authors gave us some
tantalizing clues in their 2015 survey of
[SPEAKER_05]: GW Pharmaceutical's diverse germ plasm
library, demonstrating a relationship
[SPEAKER_05]: between cannabinoid synthase variation and
quantitative chemotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: In essence, certain single-letter
nucleotide changes in the genes
[SPEAKER_05]: responsible for CBDA and THCA production
lead to different cannabinoid purities
[SPEAKER_05]: ranging from 66% to 90% in the case of
CBDA in type 3 plants, leaving up to 10%
[SPEAKER_05]: of the total cannabinoid fraction as other
compounds, even in the purest CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zerpl's 2018 paper demonstrates that
CBDAS, the gene responsible for CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: production, in vitro produces CBDA,
THCA, CBCA, and five other unknown
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds in ratios affected by substrate
pH, but reportedly normalized to 20 to 1
[SPEAKER_05]: to 1 for the known products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Larry Smart's lab at Cornell has done some
great work over the past three years
[SPEAKER_05]: cataloging and characterizing commercially
available hemp varieties, and getting
[SPEAKER_05]: great graduate student publications in the
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their work on time series cannabinoid
accumulation in field trials shows that
[SPEAKER_05]: most type 3 germ plasm grown in the US
tested about 25 to 1 CBD to THC throughout
[SPEAKER_05]: its flowering period.
[SPEAKER_05]: Taken together, we now know that most THC
produced in these high CBD varieties is
[SPEAKER_05]: coming from the gene responsible for CBDA
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't have one without the other,
but their co-presence is predictable.
[SPEAKER_05]: During this time, we spent a lot of energy
in these intervening years developing
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties that would meet a stringent 0.3%
day of harvest limit, since that was the
[SPEAKER_05]: initial direction proposed by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were successful in doing so with CBG
dominant varieties, as well as CBDV rich
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our CBG varieties are made possible
through a synthase variant we found in one
[SPEAKER_05]: of our inbred populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a full length THCAS with a single
snip at 1064 base pairs responsible for
[SPEAKER_05]: significant loss of function, with final
flowers averaging 101 CBGA to THCA ratios,
[SPEAKER_05]: and always compliant when grown as hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our work with high variant content
varieties has shown that unlike their
[SPEAKER_05]: pencil counterparts, the cannabinoid
fraction undergoes dramatic changes over
[SPEAKER_05]: the course of flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: The variant proportion of total
cannabinoids decreases as flowers mature.
[SPEAKER_05]: From a compliance perspective,
this is a really beneficial outcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since THCVA is not included in the 0.3
total THC harvest limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this example, THCVA is present at
levels three times higher than THCA at
[SPEAKER_05]: that critical 28 day pre harvest window.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the two dropped to an equal one to one
ratio by the end of flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: The shift in federal policy to a 28 day
pre harvest test allows nearly all type
[SPEAKER_05]: three plants to test below the legal
limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: If varieties are fully mature in eight
weeks, even with high cannabinoid content
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we believe that this is a good
compromise until Congress can be convinced
[SPEAKER_05]: to implement a 1% total THC rule across
the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other recent research has significantly
contributed to our understanding of
[SPEAKER_05]: specific traits and relative genomic
location.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Grasso-Weibland team's excellent
publication accompanying the CS10
[SPEAKER_05]: reference genome release found total
cannabinoid potency markers present on
[SPEAKER_05]: chromosomes three, four, six, nine in the
X chromosome.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have also been some really great
papers on terpene synthase pathways
[SPEAKER_05]: recently with the Allen, Booth and Zager
research, three independent papers really
[SPEAKER_05]: standing out as the most useful.
[SPEAKER_05]: These help us place many of the mono and
sesquiterpene TPS variants on chromosomes
[SPEAKER_05]: one, five and six with some di-terpenes on
chromosomes four and seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Van Velzen paper on cannabinoid
oxidocyclase gene families places the
[SPEAKER_05]: CBGAS synthase on the X chromosome as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our team used Lighthouse genomics snip
chip data from a segregating F2 population
[SPEAKER_05]: to co-publish with Dewey Scientific and
identify PM1, the first powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_05]: resistance gene in cannabis and show that
its location is on chromosome two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Urofin snip chip validation run on a
different F2 population containing day
[SPEAKER_05]: neutral individuals placed the mechanisms
controlling that particular flowering
[SPEAKER_05]: response on chromosome one as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Subsequent Illumina shotgun sequencing of
the same population by NR gene and data
[SPEAKER_05]: analysis with our collaborators at OSU and
the Vining Lab yielded markers associated
[SPEAKER_05]: with elevated total propyl cannabinoid
fractions which we know from other
[SPEAKER_05]: publications to be a polygenic trait on
chromosome three, four, five, seven,
[SPEAKER_05]: eight and nine with a single marker on
chromosome three having the greatest
[SPEAKER_05]: impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: Between the shifting policy landscape and
research developments cannabis essential
[SPEAKER_05]: oil breeding programs are quickly moving
from an opaque guessing game requiring
[SPEAKER_05]: multiple methods of triangulation to one
where many traits can be determined at the
[SPEAKER_05]: seedling stage with targeted PCR tests and
particular crosses can be designed in a
[SPEAKER_05]: way that maximizes successful outcomes
while not getting mired down and
[SPEAKER_05]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: dreams.
[SPEAKER_05]: This becomes even more important as we
consider that the frontier of production
[SPEAKER_05]: of all cannabinoid plant types will most
likely be polyploid and much more
[SPEAKER_05]: genetically complex than the diploids we
all know and love.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why triploids?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's turn to triploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Triploids are cannabis plants that are
basically incredibly resistant to
[SPEAKER_05]: pollination as well as have exciting
attributes brought on by extra genome
[SPEAKER_05]: copies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our development of triploids was born out
of the trauma of losing several crops to
[SPEAKER_05]: cross pollination events in 2016 and 2018
and hearing horror stories from growers
[SPEAKER_05]: year after year.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've grown cannabis you likely
understand how devastating pollen drift
[SPEAKER_05]: can be on crops and it can travel hundreds
of miles in the right conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fully pollinated plants produce 50% less
flower weight and 30% less cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: A seeded crop is essentially worthless if
you're growing for triploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're growing for cannabinoids,
you're not going to be able to grow them
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers and still devastating if your end
goal is biomass and extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we've also seen in the first seven
years of production in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_05]: feral populations of cannabis are
regularly establishing themselves in
[SPEAKER_05]: fowler fields and have become a big enough
concern that our Department of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_05]: is now working on rules and penalties for
landowners who fail to control rogue
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: In newly opened Midwestern production
areas, previous research has shown that
[SPEAKER_05]: over a third of all airborne pollen in the
summertime in the month of August is
[SPEAKER_05]: derived from feral hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having a plant that's relatively incapable
of being pollinated could fix a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: those issues and threats and let farmers
put their energy into growing great crops
[SPEAKER_05]: instead of worrying.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to understand triploids we need to
establish some basic terminology and I
[SPEAKER_05]: apologize to anyone who this is easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me it is not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a long a long trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chromosomes are packed together
collections of DNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: So DNA is the underlying genetic
instructions for life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's helpful to think of chromosomes as
books of code which make up the library
[SPEAKER_05]: that is an organism.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every species has a unique number of books
in its library.
[SPEAKER_05]: Humans have 46, naked mole rats have 60,
and cannabis has 20 in the diploid state.
[SPEAKER_05]: This library size is referred to as the
chromosome set number.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ploiety refers to the number of homologous
sets of chromosomes in an organism.
[SPEAKER_05]: Organisms with a single set are referred
to as haploid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two is diploid, three sets triploid,
four sets tetraploid, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any organism with a ploidy higher than two
is referred to as a polyploid.
[SPEAKER_05]: In sexually reproducing species,
one half of the chromosome sets are
[SPEAKER_05]: inherited from each respective parent.
[SPEAKER_05]: For humans this means our individual
genome is actually a fusion of two
[SPEAKER_05]: different genomes cut in half during
reproduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're truly one half of both parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same is true for diploid plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: While most vertebrates are diploid,
many, many plants are polyploid.
[SPEAKER_05]: These include major agricultural crops of
critical importance to humans such as
[SPEAKER_05]: coffee, bananas, strawberries,
bread wheat, oats, citrus, potatoes,
[SPEAKER_05]: and tobacco to just name a few.
[SPEAKER_05]: The main point to understand is that
polyploidization is a natural phenomenon
[SPEAKER_05]: that has occurred many times in nature and
has led to the creation of the ancestors
[SPEAKER_05]: of many modern crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Polyploid induction in nature tends to
correspond with extreme climate events or
[SPEAKER_05]: natural disasters and lead to increased
diversity within a species.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only documented naturally occurring
tetraploid cannabis population was found
[SPEAKER_05]: at 14,000 feet in elevation in the
Himalayas by an Indian research effort
[SPEAKER_05]: about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: The extreme climate and altitude may have
been the causal agent responsible for that
[SPEAKER_05]: particular event.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can think of this as nature's way of
creating options for diverse responses
[SPEAKER_05]: under changing circumstances.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also important to note that these
events are not changing the underlying DNA
[SPEAKER_05]: in any way or introducing new genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're simply whole genome duplications
of what was already present.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the case of polyploids, more gene
copies is believed to confer better
[SPEAKER_05]: adaptability and resilience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plant breeders became aware of the
remarkable superiority of polyploids in
[SPEAKER_05]: the mid-20th century and have induced
polyploidy and or used natural polyploids
[SPEAKER_05]: in many ways to obtain increasingly
improved plant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the most important consequences of
polyploidy for plant breeding are the
[SPEAKER_05]: increased size of plant organs,
so bigger flowers, bigger leaves,
[SPEAKER_05]: bigger stems, the buffering of deleterious
mutations, increased heterozygosity,
[SPEAKER_05]: and superior heterosis or hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cultivars have been generated with higher
yields, improved product quality,
[SPEAKER_05]: and increased tolerance to both biotic and
abiotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Polyploidy is a tried and true method of
improvement in many crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: An important bonus to all this is that
plants with odd chromosome set numbers,
[SPEAKER_05]: so triploids, pentaploids, and so on,
often prove to be infertile.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what makes seedless watermelons,
bananas, hops, and now cannabis a reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing you need to know about this
is that the haploid cannabis genome is 800
[SPEAKER_05]: megabases in size.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll save some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our polyploid development program was
designed and led by Dr. Shen Chen,
[SPEAKER_05]: OSU grad who's now an assistant professor
at NC State.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our goal was to convert our diploid
breeding stock and these take three to
[SPEAKER_05]: four years to develop on their own,
but our goal was to convert these into
[SPEAKER_05]: tetraploids and beyond, test the fertility
of various ploidies in controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: environments, and to test the agronomic
traits of various ploidies via controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: crosses and initial field trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: This work began in early 2019 and was
occurring simultaneously to the efforts at
[SPEAKER_05]: Canopy Growth Corporation and Jessica
Lovell Brand's lab at the University of
[SPEAKER_05]: Connecticut, both of whom have recently
published papers describing their
[SPEAKER_05]: processes, and we did as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say this as a way of not so subtly
conveying some disapproval of the most
[SPEAKER_05]: recent claim to emerge from a large
purveyor of clones here in California,
[SPEAKER_05]: who if you were at the Emerald Cup last
December, you probably know what I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about, just launched what they
purport to be the world's first triploid
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a day and age so rife with
misinformation, history will probably not
[SPEAKER_05]: care one way or the other, but for some of
us, truth is more important than marketing
[SPEAKER_05]: efforts, and I for one believe it's
important to acknowledge the labor of
[SPEAKER_05]: others that led to increased knowledge
that benefits us.
[SPEAKER_05]: On that note, while our company was
actually the first to offer triploid
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis commercially in 2021,
the Horta Farm Group that I had previously
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned, led by Dave Watson,
were likely the first to test triploids
[SPEAKER_05]: back in the 1990s, and I'd like to
publicly acknowledge that effort and his
[SPEAKER_05]: encouragement of our program as we went
through the R&D phase.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that aside, let's get into the details
and our findings from the past three years
[SPEAKER_05]: on cannabis ploidy research.
[SPEAKER_05]: Controlled genome doubling events require
initial plants, a cell division inhibitor,
[SPEAKER_05]: steady hands, patients, and a flow
cytometer, which is a really cool piece of
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment capable of measuring an
organism's cell size.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hundreds of asexually propagated clones of
a target plant genotype are pruned back
[SPEAKER_05]: until a single growth point remains,
and then colchicine is applied to that
[SPEAKER_05]: growth point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most plants die within a month.
[SPEAKER_05]: The few survivors are screened by flow
cytometry, and any confirmed tetraploids
[SPEAKER_05]: move on to the stabilization process.
[SPEAKER_05]: At each step, plants are re-screened
repeatedly, as they have a tendency to
[SPEAKER_05]: revert to lower or mixed ploides until
fixed.
[SPEAKER_05]: A term I use lightly is diploid reversion
is always a possibility under stressful
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: If a plant has 10 shoots, all 10 shoots
are tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: This continues until that relative
stability is attained, and then the plants
[SPEAKER_05]: are ready for seed production in our case,
but not before a final flow testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: To date, we've now successfully created
tetraploid versions of all of our classic
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD CBG, CBDV, and CBGV production
mothers, as well as a long list of type
[SPEAKER_05]: one plants in our germplasm library,
and have incorporated the streamlined
[SPEAKER_05]: conversion process into our breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Start to finish, this process takes about
eight months.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the breeding that leads up to it,
but just the conversion process is about
[SPEAKER_05]: eight months.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys have time, everybody have
time?
[SPEAKER_05]: You got about a three minute video clip?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, cool, everybody's got time.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Brendan Rojas.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is our ploidy lab manager.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's gonna walk you through a very quick
description of what it looks like in the
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse and the lab to actually convert
and test these plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna go through the process for
converting plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first step is after we've gotten the
plants, is we'll trim it down to just a
[SPEAKER_09]: single mare stem.
[SPEAKER_09]: For this plant, you can see it's right at
the top, just right here, this one single
[SPEAKER_09]: mare stem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And after that, what we'll do is we'll
take a piece of cotton and we'll just wrap
[SPEAKER_09]: it right around that one single mare stem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then come in with colchicine and add
just a little bit of colchicine to fully
[SPEAKER_09]: hydrate that cotton swab.
[SPEAKER_09]: So after everything's been treated,
we need to keep the plants moist and warm
[SPEAKER_09]: so that they have a good environment to
grow in.
[SPEAKER_09]: To do that, we use a second, one of these
black trays, and we prop it up with cinder
[SPEAKER_09]: blocks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we use this plastic to wrap all
the way around to ensure that it holds
[SPEAKER_09]: that humidity inside.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once everything's been treated,
we do the treatments for four days in a
[SPEAKER_09]: row.
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the fourth day, we pull the
cotton off and then rinse the mare stems
[SPEAKER_09]: with water so that we rinse off any of
that excess colchicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then after they've been treated,
in about two weeks, we'll start to see
[SPEAKER_09]: growth from those points.
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that growth, we'll take them up
to the tissue culture building to start
[SPEAKER_09]: running flow on them and to check our
results.
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this point, I've got a plant that's
been treated with colchicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one single mare stem was treated.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what we have in front of us is a
plant that's grown up from that single
[SPEAKER_09]: mare stem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I'll do is I'll come in with a
pair of scissors and I'll take just one
[SPEAKER_09]: leaf sample.
[SPEAKER_09]: The samples can range in size.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need a whole leaf.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can use as little as just a leaf tip.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very small.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have two buffers that the sample goes
into.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one's an extraction buffer.
[SPEAKER_09]: That just helps make sure that when you're
chopping the plant material, the nuclei in
[SPEAKER_09]: the plant material don't break apart.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second one is a fluorescent stain
buffer, which dyes the nuclei of the cells
[SPEAKER_09]: within the plant material, which makes it
possible for our flow cytometer to
[SPEAKER_09]: actually read the genetic material in the
nuclei.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the extraction buffer.
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes into a Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets chopped.
[SPEAKER_09]: The nuclei get stained.
[SPEAKER_09]: We then run the plant material through a
filter so we don't clog up our machine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Goes into the sample cell and then it
should start running.
[SPEAKER_09]: So after the sample's been prepared and we
put it into the flow machine, what the
[SPEAKER_09]: flow cytometer actually does is it takes
the liquid that we just prepared and it
[SPEAKER_09]: runs it through a very small cuvette in a
single file line where it lines up all the
[SPEAKER_09]: nuclei in just one row.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it shoots a UV light through the
nuclei as it goes through this one
[SPEAKER_09]: cuvette.
[SPEAKER_09]: So based off of how the UV light reflects
off of the nuclei that we just prepared,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's how it gets the readout and we get
the results on a graph.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of like a relative peak of
the genetic material within the nuclei.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Brendan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Oregon cannabis breeding duct tape,
zip ties, and now with laser beams.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our lab's been operating with the two
quantum P flow cytometer units for the
[SPEAKER_05]: past couple of years, but just recently
added a high throughput Cytoflex V2 with
[SPEAKER_05]: two lasers, which I'm told is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a higher throughput.
[SPEAKER_05]: It allows us to use standard 96 well
plates to be able to have a much,
[SPEAKER_05]: much larger number of plants get screened
at any given time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see in these images the resulting
peaks generated by that flow cytometer
[SPEAKER_05]: when testing plant material with various
ploidies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So flow cytometer results on the far left
and then some chromosome squash pictures
[SPEAKER_05]: from microscope in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Using multiple methods to validate ploidy
levels is especially necessary when
[SPEAKER_05]: creating baselines for further analysis,
but the chromosome pictures here help to
[SPEAKER_05]: convey the cellular changes present in
these polyploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's really a lot more genetic
information in these plants and you can
[SPEAKER_05]: see it when you get close enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Diploid cannabis plants contain about
60,000 genes and have a genome size of 1.6
[SPEAKER_05]: gigabases.
[SPEAKER_05]: Triploids contain about 90,000 genes and
have a genome size of 2.4 gigabases.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tetraploids contain 120,000 genes and have
a genome size of 3.2 gigabases,
[SPEAKER_05]: or roughly half the size of humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: These extra gene copies are what is
believed to drive resilience and
[SPEAKER_05]: adaptability in polyploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So seedlessness in triploid cannabis,
that'd be an awesome thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But we had to design some experiments that
would adequately test that claim.
[SPEAKER_05]: To do so, we created six crossing
combinations to assess seed production and
[SPEAKER_05]: viability.
[SPEAKER_05]: Diploid, triploid, and tetraploid versions
of the same F1 hybrid were pollinated by
[SPEAKER_05]: diploid and tetraploid pollen donors.
[SPEAKER_05]: These trials were conducted in sealed
greenhouses and the target plants were
[SPEAKER_05]: subjected to massive amounts of pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is intended to simulate a flower crop
grown side-by-side with a large grain farm
[SPEAKER_05]: or dense feral populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: The results show that diploids pollinated
by diploids produce about two times as
[SPEAKER_05]: many seeds as tetraploids pollinated by
tetraploids, suggesting that ploidy
[SPEAKER_05]: increases result in lower fertility in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tetraploids are not viable as a pollen
donor for diploids, but are able to induce
[SPEAKER_05]: many problematically empty seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: The key finding is that seed production
was essentially nonexistent in triploids
[SPEAKER_05]: when pollinated by either a diploid or a
tetraploid in this experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even under substantial duress,
they remain nearly seed-free with a
[SPEAKER_05]: maximum average of six seeds per triploid
plant when pollinated by diploids in the
[SPEAKER_05]: controlled pollen inundation zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to significantly impeded
fertility, triploids also demonstrated
[SPEAKER_05]: superiority in many key agronomic traits
relative to their diploid counterparts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We conducted outdoor field trials at our
campus in 2020 with several different
[SPEAKER_05]: diploid, triploid, and tetraploid crossing
combinations Flower production increased
[SPEAKER_05]: between 30 to 100%, although that was
variety-dependent, with the largest leaps
[SPEAKER_05]: seen in day-neutral varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: The yield differences are statistically
significant, but the visual differences in
[SPEAKER_05]: plant size, larger leaves, larger flowers,
thicker stems, denser trichome coverage,
[SPEAKER_05]: tells you all you need to know about
triploid vigor.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a slight increase in total
cannabinoid content in flowers and a
[SPEAKER_05]: marked increase in trichome density on
sugar leaves near flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, olfactory compounds were
noticeably more abundant in triploids and
[SPEAKER_05]: tetraploids compared to diploids,
but we did not test for total terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: content in this study because terpenes
tell us less than half the story,
[SPEAKER_05]: and most of the major aroma components of
our varieties are not terpenes at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more about that to come.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have enough time for the entire
story today, but we'll get into it with a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit more detail later.
[SPEAKER_05]: These early results suggested that
triploids are much more resilient to any
[SPEAKER_05]: challenges they face relative to diploid
counterparts.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2021, we followed up with extended
field trials in North Carolina State
[SPEAKER_05]: University, Cornell, and the University of
Kentucky as part of our founding
[SPEAKER_05]: membership of the FAR-sponsored hemp
research consortium.
[SPEAKER_05]: The study design at all three institutions
were very similar, with diploid and
[SPEAKER_05]: triploid versions of our feminized
varieties planted on four-foot centers at
[SPEAKER_05]: two separate outdoor field sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: In each study, one field was designated as
a negative pollen control, and the other
[SPEAKER_05]: was purposefully planted at a high density
with male, female diploid grain varieties
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately adjacent to the trial
locations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Final research reports from all three
institutions will be available on their
[SPEAKER_05]: extension website soon, but they were kind
enough to grant us some of the preliminary
[SPEAKER_05]: data for today.
[SPEAKER_05]: In North Carolina, the Goldsboro location
served as the positive pollen environment
[SPEAKER_05]: and Salisbury the negative control.
[SPEAKER_05]: White CBG, suverhaze, and lifter varieties
were trialed in both diploid and triploid
[SPEAKER_05]: form, thanks to David Suchoff and his team
for their work on this trial and the
[SPEAKER_05]: subsequent data.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the negative pollen control Salisbury
site, differences in biomass defined as
[SPEAKER_05]: non-stem, flower, foliage, and any seed
produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Differences in biomass between the two
ploidies at harvest was not statistically
[SPEAKER_05]: significant, but it is worth noting that
the amount of variation was greater in the
[SPEAKER_05]: triploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the positive pollen Goldsboro location,
biomass production was greater in
[SPEAKER_05]: triploids by about a quarter pound per
plant, and the difference was
[SPEAKER_05]: statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Differences in seeding were all
statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pollinated diploids produced about 2,500
seeds per plant, while triploids were
[SPEAKER_05]: around 50, or about 2% relative to their
diploid counterparts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seed weight per plant followed a genotype
specific pattern that at this point
[SPEAKER_05]: generates more questions than answers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Relative seed size between the genotypes
varies with lifter seed much smaller than
[SPEAKER_05]: white CBG in general, which may account
for some of the variations seen here,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there also seems to be an
unexplainable element at play as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Note the single outlier with much higher
seed weight present in the triploid
[SPEAKER_05]: suverhase variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a little line up there on the
triploid section on the far right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trials at Cornell included lifter,
suverhase, and white CBG in both diploid
[SPEAKER_05]: and triploid forms, as well as sour
lifter, sour suverhase, and sour RNA as
[SPEAKER_05]: triploids only.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to Larry Smart and his lab for
their work on this project.
[SPEAKER_05]: This particular trial is a great example
of the phrase farming happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stripped biomass yields highlight this,
as triploids did not fare as well compared
[SPEAKER_05]: to their diploid counterparts,
with suverhase being the lone exception.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem here was that large portions
of the negative pollen trial site were
[SPEAKER_05]: subjected to catastrophic flooding
multiple times this past summer,
[SPEAKER_05]: and were eager to follow up next year to
get improved data.
[SPEAKER_05]: That said, it's definitely an example of a
time where negative environmental events
[SPEAKER_05]: do seem to impact triploids more than
diploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of seed counts and weight,
triploids again demonstrated their
[SPEAKER_05]: remarkable infertility relative to
diploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the pollen positive site, triploids
contain an average of 11.3% as many seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: as diploids, and produce 10.5% as much
seed weight as diploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: While a good result for triploids,
the seed amounts are significantly higher
[SPEAKER_05]: than those reported at NC State.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Kentucky, the North Farm location
served as the positive pollen environment,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the South Farm the negative control.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this study, lifter and white CBG were
trialed as diploids and triploids,
[SPEAKER_05]: while our new forbidden V and pine walker
CBD V dominant triploid varieties were
[SPEAKER_05]: also included.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to Bob Pierce and his team for
their work on this trial and data
[SPEAKER_05]: collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Biomass and seed yields were reported as
pounds per acre in this study.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the exception of diploid lifter,
overall biomass yields were higher at the
[SPEAKER_05]: pollinated site relative to the negative
pollen control site, which when taking the
[SPEAKER_05]: underlying seed weights into account,
suggests that environmental conditions may
[SPEAKER_05]: have contributed to this particular
outcome as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That said, triploids consistently produced
more biomass than their diploid
[SPEAKER_05]: counterparts in both locations,
and again produced very few seeds when
[SPEAKER_05]: subjected to pollen challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the interesting unanticipated
pieces of information that we receive from
[SPEAKER_05]: the Kentucky trial is some observations on
relative disease resistance between
[SPEAKER_05]: diploid and triploid cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: During the 2021 growing season,
University of Kentucky observed that
[SPEAKER_05]: triploid versions of lifter appeared to be
significantly more resistant to leaf spot
[SPEAKER_05]: diseases than their diploid counterparts,
as measured by the percentage of the leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: affected by the disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: This pattern of resistance was true for
three of the most important foliar fungal
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogens observed in the southern region
of the United States, circospora,
[SPEAKER_05]: bipolaris, and septoria.
[SPEAKER_05]: These three pathogens, each of which cause
leaf spots where spores land on the leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: surface and colonize the surrounding
tissue, are some of the most economically
[SPEAKER_05]: important pathogens of the southern part
of the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: The relative importance to each other is
still being investigated, but as you can
[SPEAKER_05]: see in the photograph, they have the
ability to cause major reductions in
[SPEAKER_05]: economic yield and likely exist in disease
complexes whereby several of the pathogens
[SPEAKER_05]: are present at the same time causing
disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same trend was not seen for white CBG.
[SPEAKER_05]: The diploid and triploid counterparts were
approximately equal in terms of their
[SPEAKER_05]: susceptibility to these particular
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Furthermore, while we don't have diploid
comparisons for our CBDV cultivars,
[SPEAKER_05]: those are all triploids, they appear to be
extremely resistant to all three fungal
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Increases in ploidy have been implicated
in increases in disease resistance in
[SPEAKER_05]: other cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, in hops, the most closely
related plant of economic importance to
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Research has shown that the effect of
ploidy on disease resistance can be highly
[SPEAKER_05]: dependent, and not only, it's dependent
not only on the crop species, but can vary
[SPEAKER_05]: even amongst varieties within the same
species.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this way, it's not surprising to see
this impact of ploidy on lifter and not
[SPEAKER_05]: white CBG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin McKiernan's team, in their preprint
a couple years ago, noted an interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: correlation between CBCAS cassettes on
chromosome seven and disease resistance in
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still a lot of inquiry into that
line of reasoning, but what I wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: mention is fairly interesting and not
entirely proven at this point,
[SPEAKER_05]: but our CBDV dominant varieties have
basically four copies of that CBCAS
[SPEAKER_05]: cassette over and above what a normal type
three plant would have, so it's a fairly
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting correlation.
[SPEAKER_05]: These initial data from Kentucky helped
give us important insight into disease
[SPEAKER_05]: resistance in cannabis and how we may
start to leverage this information for
[SPEAKER_05]: future breeding goals to make more robust
varieties for farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: The farmer experience in 2021.
[SPEAKER_05]: The quote at the very top sort of says it
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else we grew last year got
seeded.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of the experience with folks
that were growing triploids and diploids
[SPEAKER_05]: side by side that underwent pollen
challenges.
[SPEAKER_05]: With a few exceptions, indoor farmers
relayed nearly universal acclaim on
[SPEAKER_05]: performance, especially when subjected to
unplanned pollen challenges.
[SPEAKER_05]: They report qualitative improvement in
overall aroma character and intensity,
[SPEAKER_05]: faster maturation of flowers, larger
yields, and probably most importantly,
[SPEAKER_05]: dense top grade flowers, even on lower
branches.
[SPEAKER_05]: The main drawbacks reported are that
triploids tend to perform worse than
[SPEAKER_05]: diploids in low light conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, another situation where the
environment ends up impacting plants that
[SPEAKER_05]: have higher ploidies in a little bit more
profound way.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were also a small number of
isolated, cosmetically undesirable
[SPEAKER_05]: hermaphroditic flower sports on these
triploids compared to the diploid
[SPEAKER_05]: counterparts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Farmers' outdoor experiences were very
positive and relative triploid infertility
[SPEAKER_05]: seemed to prevent seed formation for most,
including several in Colorado with
[SPEAKER_05]: intensive feral hemp populations that have
been decimated the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Outdoor flowering response was slower than
the trigger by about two weeks,
[SPEAKER_05]: largely driven by the underlying genome
imbalance of our hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So two genomes are derived from the
photoperiod parent and one from the
[SPEAKER_05]: day-neutral parent.
[SPEAKER_05]: The opposite is true when the pairing is
reversed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So two day-neutral genome copies and one
photoperiod genome copy leads to earlier
[SPEAKER_05]: flower formation with a late August,
early September harvest time at 45 degrees
[SPEAKER_05]: north in the experimental varieties we
trialed last summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: In general, farmers loved triploids and
many swear to never grow diploids again,
[SPEAKER_05]: and honestly myself included in production
environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were several outliers worth noting
because as awesome as these higher ploidy
[SPEAKER_05]: plants are, nothing is a cure-all.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had reports from about 12 farmers out
of hundreds last year who were seeded at
[SPEAKER_05]: levels that were higher than sporadic,
not as bad as diploids under full
[SPEAKER_05]: pollination, but more effective than we
had previously seen, including at the
[SPEAKER_05]: university field trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Imri Garcia, our client support expert,
and Andrea Garfinkel, the director of R&D
[SPEAKER_05]: for us, visited most of these farms in
person, collected samples, and got as much
[SPEAKER_05]: detail as possible from the farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leaf samples from the affected plants were
confirmed as triploids by flow cytometry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some seeds were capable of germination,
this is pretty interesting, and tested
[SPEAKER_05]: between diploid and triploid, making them
alloploids with more than two sets of
[SPEAKER_05]: homologous chromosomes but less than
three.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pollen pressure impacting the farms
were equally mixed between very large
[SPEAKER_05]: feral populations in the Midwest and the
surrounding areas, intense localized
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure from neighboring farms,
and what we termed paranormal triploid
[SPEAKER_05]: self-pollination, where no other
discernible explanation could be
[SPEAKER_05]: identified.
[SPEAKER_05]: Continued field trials and data collection
are necessary to better understand these
[SPEAKER_05]: anomalies, but I think it's safe to say
that they're definitely outliers from the
[SPEAKER_05]: overwhelmingly positive results most
farmers experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: But definitely not the only anomalies
we've seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: This plant just never ceases to amaze,
small case in point.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the summer of 2020, my brother,
Eric, picked out four absolutely
[SPEAKER_05]: outstanding plants in a highly inbred
diploid population of day-neutral type
[SPEAKER_05]: four plants grown from seed in our
breeding program during a seed
[SPEAKER_05]: multiplication run.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a parallel breeding line to the
pollen donor that we use to create white
[SPEAKER_05]: CBG and stem cell CBG.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is gonna be the final selection out
of about 3,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: These were literally the best,
and you know what's gonna happen here,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The plants had larger leaves and flowers,
more resin content, and far stronger aroma
[SPEAKER_05]: than any of the others.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ploidy screening revealed that all four
were tetraploid, while the remaining
[SPEAKER_05]: population were diploid, as expected.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeds produced on these tetraploids were
screened, and they came back as triploid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why were there tetraploids in this
population of diploids?
[SPEAKER_05]: Fast forward to last spring, we submitted
our first commercial triploid seed for
[SPEAKER_05]: germination, purity, and ploidy screening
to the Oregon State University Seed Lab,
[SPEAKER_05]: and received these results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Relative rates of triploidy in seed
produced from tetraploid seed carriers and
[SPEAKER_05]: diploid pollen parents appears linked to
the pollen donor lineage.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this example, Suver, Hayes,
and Lifter, both of which share the same
[SPEAKER_05]: ERB day-neutral pollen donor, tested at
100% triploid.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sour versions of both, which utilizes
the same tetraploid production mothers,
[SPEAKER_05]: but switches pollen donors to a unique
terpenoline-dominant day-neutral variety,
[SPEAKER_05]: resulted in 97% and 93% triploidy rates,
respectively, while the remaining 3% to 7%
[SPEAKER_05]: tested as tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we were also the first to
release tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't really mean to do that,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same is true in stem cell CBG and
white CBG varieties, where 1% to 5%
[SPEAKER_05]: respectively tested as tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So armed with this confusing new
knowledge, we implemented a new step in
[SPEAKER_05]: our commercial seed production program
this year, where every pollen donor was
[SPEAKER_05]: ploidy screened to confirm diploid status.
[SPEAKER_05]: While no tetraploids were found in any
populations, triploids were present in
[SPEAKER_05]: both donor lines at rates less than 0.5%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even with the offenders removed from our
process, the resulting seed continues to
[SPEAKER_05]: throw low rates of tetraploids in certain
genotype combinations.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is made even more confusing when the
breeding history of the pollen donors
[SPEAKER_05]: interrogated.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are lines produced via multiple
generations of self-pollination of single
[SPEAKER_05]: plants in isolation tents with HEPA
filters that only I have access to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made all these seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know with 100% certainty, and we
confirmed it via flow cytometry,
[SPEAKER_05]: that the parent was a diploid.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done whole genome sequencing on both
the parent and resulting offspring.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that these plants are from the
same source.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no good explanation.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we've received from Oregon State
University is we've been told that it's,
[SPEAKER_05]: I consider it a speculative alternative,
related to a non-disjunction during
[SPEAKER_05]: meiosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, okay, I know that has something to
do with pollen and cell division.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's gotta be a fascinating
dissertation for someone in there to
[SPEAKER_05]: figure out what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I'm absolutely awestruck by is
that nature does find a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, the first triploid,
cannabis, was actually released by
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis itself, probably millions of
times over and long before humans existed
[SPEAKER_05]: in modern form.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a good one for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: In summary on triploids, we're seeing
dramatically reduced fertility,
[SPEAKER_05]: although not 100% seedless.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very close, but not quite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Relatively unchanged cannabinoids between
diploids and triploids and even
[SPEAKER_05]: tetraploids, although there is some
evidence that suggests that there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: slight increase.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we need to do more
replications of that to get to the bottom
[SPEAKER_05]: of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In our experience, yields are higher,
but come with that slightly delayed
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering response.
[SPEAKER_05]: The most dramatic example of yield can be
found in our day-neutral varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our best 2018 day-neutral diploid yielded
about 250 grams of flower, which is really
[SPEAKER_05]: good for a day-neutral.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an auto-flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Auto-flowering variety, very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the improved triploid version this
past summer produced over 658 grams of
[SPEAKER_05]: usable flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my brother did not change sizes
between those two pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lost a little bit of hair with two
newborns, but same size guy for scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Olfactory compounds seem to be
qualitatively heightened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say qualitatively, this is a sticky
issue, likely due to combinatorial effects
[SPEAKER_05]: of unique aroma pathways being multiplied.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have enough time today to get
into the details and it's not my story to
[SPEAKER_05]: fully tell, but if you want breadcrumbs,
do search for unfunded USDA grants on hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: aroma compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the general point is that terpenes
contribute about 50% of the total aroma in
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most analytical reports on them are not
very helpful because there's only eight to
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 terpenes, depending on the variety of
cannabis, but about eight to 10 terpenes
[SPEAKER_05]: that are even above the detectable odor
threshold.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're looking at a terpene test
result that has 0.05%, depending on the
[SPEAKER_05]: compound, you may not be smelling that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a lot of the analytical data that
we see commercially available for folks
[SPEAKER_05]: isn't actually capturing what's
responsible for those underlying aromas.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of the aroma is comprised of
things like esters, sulfur-containing
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds that were described earlier
today, aldehydes, and others that can
[SPEAKER_05]: dramatically impact the sensory experience
even when present in trace amounts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking like parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hypothesis here is because unique
precursor pathways are responsible for
[SPEAKER_05]: many of these compounds, their presence
and diversity could be driving the overall
[SPEAKER_05]: loudness of aroma, which would then be
magnified by increased copy numbers in
[SPEAKER_05]: polyploids.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's obviously much more work to be
done in this area, but the early findings
[SPEAKER_05]: lend support to this view.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's obviously some big mysteries to be
figured out regarding pollen ploy and
[SPEAKER_05]: identification of cannabis' most efficient
ployity level for various production
[SPEAKER_05]: purposes, but our work to date strongly
suggests that lower ployities,
[SPEAKER_05]: so haploids and diploids, are best for
breeding work, while higher ployties,
[SPEAKER_05]: triploids and tetraploids so far,
with penoploids and octoploids to be
[SPEAKER_05]: tested next, seem to be better suited for
commercial production.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to wind down today's talk with
some yet-to-be-completed research that's
[SPEAKER_05]: near and dear to my heart and what I
personally believe will be one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: lasting legacies we can leave to future
generations of cannabis breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: New advances in sequencing technology and
bioinformatics pipelines are allowing for
[SPEAKER_05]: the deepest, most accurate exploration of
organisms that we've ever seen,
[SPEAKER_05]: to the point where the data's actually
pretty useful and reasonably priced
[SPEAKER_05]: relative to the return on your investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: In our lab, these advancements allowed us
to shrink our computing needs from a
[SPEAKER_05]: 384-core computing cluster the size of a
negative ADC freezer, pictured here,
[SPEAKER_05]: down to a well-equipped laptop.
[SPEAKER_05]: The wall time for assembly has gone from
over a week to just under five hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: The quality of the assembled genome has
improved from synthetic haploids to
[SPEAKER_05]: partially phased diploids using a packed
BioSeq Well 2 and the freely available
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi-Fi ASM assembler.
[SPEAKER_05]: The order of magnitude increase in
efficiency and highly accurate reads are
[SPEAKER_05]: moving us from an era of a
single-reference genome serving as a
[SPEAKER_05]: representative of an entire species,
to one where the full diversity of the
[SPEAKER_05]: species can be represented through
hundreds or even thousands of reference
[SPEAKER_05]: quality assemblies.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the new era of pangenomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Important agricultural crops like corn,
soy, cotton, and apples are some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: first plants to undergo this process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fortunous historical circumstances have
made it possible for cannabis to be
[SPEAKER_05]: brought into the club as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Greg Concepcion of PacBio recorded a talk
after the cancellation of PAG this year,
[SPEAKER_05]: where he outlines the basic steps of
pangenome construction and pangenome tool
[SPEAKER_05]: application in plants, using cannabis as
the example species, and our genome
[SPEAKER_05]: collection is the initial library.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't seen it yet, please check
it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Greg's been contributing to the cannabis
genome research efforts for years now,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we're all really lucky to have his
expertise directed at our collective
[SPEAKER_05]: genomics problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've generated very high quality Hi-Fi
whole genome assemblies for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_05]: diverse cannabis plants in our Sequel 2,
derived from our internal breeding efforts
[SPEAKER_05]: and some key publicly available clones to
build the library for initial pangenome
[SPEAKER_05]: construction.
[SPEAKER_05]: These include representatives of all
chemotypes, 1 through 5, plants with
[SPEAKER_05]: pental and propyl cannabinoids,
and what we believe to be the pantheon of
[SPEAKER_05]: potential photoperiod responses,
unique phenotypical expressions like
[SPEAKER_05]: Australian bastard cannabis and fasciated
specimens, and many diverse aroma
[SPEAKER_05]: palettes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Busco assessments of completeness
demonstrate that these assemblies offer
[SPEAKER_05]: significant improvements over the previous
reference.
[SPEAKER_05]: The irony of pangenomic promises to move
away from a single reference standard is
[SPEAKER_05]: that doing so requires at least one good
reference for bioinformatics packages to
[SPEAKER_05]: map new reads to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So while we've all been talking about
cannabis pangenomes for the last three
[SPEAKER_05]: years, progress has been agonizingly slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: The current reference, CS10, is
substantially more complete than previous
[SPEAKER_05]: publicly available assemblies and
incredibly useful for many types of
[SPEAKER_05]: inquiries, but appears to lack concordance
with more recent higher quality sequencing
[SPEAKER_05]: work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kovalchuk's 2020 review of assemblies is a
great starting point for understanding the
[SPEAKER_05]: legitimate debate about the nature of
these issues, but the implications of
[SPEAKER_05]: subpar genome representation is critical
for plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: A great example of this can be illustrated
by an alignment of chromosome 7 from CS10,
[SPEAKER_05]: both of which are type 3 plants with one
of our type 3, sorry, CS10 is a type 3,
[SPEAKER_05]: so is the plant that we are comparing to
from one of our assemblies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chromosome 7 is the physical location of
THCAS, CBDAS, CBCAS, phytochrome E,
[SPEAKER_05]: several diterpene synthases, a propyl
precursor gene, and a marker for overall
[SPEAKER_05]: potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: The different colored rectangles represent
localized collinear blocks, which are
[SPEAKER_05]: conserved genomic regions between the two.
[SPEAKER_05]: This particular alignment suggests that
the contents of each chromosome are
[SPEAKER_05]: similar, but also structurally divergent,
which, if real and not an artifact of the
[SPEAKER_05]: sequencing and assembly process,
would indicate widespread and recurrent
[SPEAKER_05]: rearrangements throughout.
[SPEAKER_05]: We suspect that this is attributable to
the lower quality sequencing approach used
[SPEAKER_05]: on CS10, which was an older Oxford
nanopore chemistry, as well as assembly
[SPEAKER_05]: artifacts that arise when collapsing two
real haplotypes into a single synthetic
[SPEAKER_05]: haploid.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, the two underlying
haploid genomes of a diploid plant that
[SPEAKER_05]: are real get combined via software into
one, not real, software representation of
[SPEAKER_05]: what the plant actually is.
[SPEAKER_05]: This ability to do diploid plants is a
brand new opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's very few other genomes,
in terms of reference genomes,
[SPEAKER_05]: that have been fully phased and released
as both haplotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we used, yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used several sequencing approaches to
build a new pangenome anchor reference and
[SPEAKER_05]: brought in collaborators from PacBio,
BioNano, Dovetail, NC State, Cornell,
[SPEAKER_05]: and Oregon State University.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant serving as reference is the same
F1 hybrid we self-pollinated to generate
[SPEAKER_05]: our segregating F2 breeding population,
yielding autoflour and varin markers,
[SPEAKER_05]: and has a genome size of 1.4456 gigabases,
as estimated by Shen Chen at NC State.
[SPEAKER_05]: The two parents, one a type 1 high-propyl,
16-week flowering nightmare of a plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the other a day-neutral type 3 plant
that flowers in about six weeks,
[SPEAKER_05]: were sequenced using PacBio's CLI CLR
technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: The F1 itself was sequenced twice using
PacBio's Hi-Fi process, generating two
[SPEAKER_05]: full smart cells of data.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi-Fi ASM, using both CLR parental data
sets as input guides, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi-Fi ASM was then used at the trial bin
function, using those two parental
[SPEAKER_05]: assemblies as input guides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi-C data on the F1 was generated by
Dovetail genomics and was used to scaffold
[SPEAKER_05]: contigs into pseudo-chromosomes for both
haplotypes, and the resulting draft
[SPEAKER_05]: assemblies are now being verified against
optical maps created by BioNano,
[SPEAKER_05]: and these are amazing, they're really
cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't give you any indication of
nucleotide identity, but they'll tell you
[SPEAKER_05]: basically the full length and size of
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're also using linkage maps
constructed by Dustin Wilkerson at
[SPEAKER_05]: Cornell, generated from NR gene alumina
shotgun reads of 289 of the F2S1
[SPEAKER_05]: individuals from our reference example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dovetail is currently annotating both
haplotypes using multiple tissue RNA-seq
[SPEAKER_05]: runs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the project's nearing the finish line,
and we're really excited to release this
[SPEAKER_05]: first phased diploid cannabis genome for
everyone to use.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the initial results have already
proven useful for us and allowed the
[SPEAKER_05]: deployment of some promising pangenome
tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most importantly, the results are
suggesting most cannabis chromosomes are
[SPEAKER_05]: fairly stable relative to what many of us
previously believed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the same comparison of chromosome
seven from the two haplotypes of our draft
[SPEAKER_05]: reference assembly, just to highlight the
improvement experienced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the previous chromosome seven
alignment produced acid reflux,
[SPEAKER_05]: the alignment between haplotypes in our
assembly is more like a sigh of relief.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's my interpretation here,
despite the fact that one is THCA
[SPEAKER_05]: containing and the other is CBDA
containing.
[SPEAKER_05]: More technical details on this entire
project will be released by a much more
[SPEAKER_05]: competent scientist who are working with
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're shooting for a fall 2022 to an early
winter 2023 release of all this data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the creation of the first publicly
available cannabis pangenome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says I have two minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of fall 2022, one last
announcement.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're using this information gleaned from
these all-to-all comparisons to help us
[SPEAKER_05]: design varieties that maximize heterosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: MASH is one of these pangenomic tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: It estimates genomic distance and mutation
rates within our plant library,
[SPEAKER_05]: giving us unparalleled insight into the
relatedness of particular plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Results from early analysis suggested that
the inbred photoperiod line developed for
[SPEAKER_05]: a white CBG hybrid seed is the most
genetically distant from others in our
[SPEAKER_05]: library.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to take advantage of that, we paired it
with two CBD dominant day neutral pollen
[SPEAKER_05]: donor lines to create two new hybrid type
three lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: We field trial these in 2021 and we're
really, really impressed with the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were standouts in the field for yield
and flower structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: These positive results, along with our
internal analysis of the underlying whole
[SPEAKER_05]: genome data, are aiding our breeding
decisions as we move forward with
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial type one and type two
varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our first release of type one and type two
F1 triploid seed will take place this fall
[SPEAKER_05]: with a specific eye towards the THC flower
market and a pairing of classic flavor
[SPEAKER_05]: architectures with exciting twists
informed by our internal flavor
[SPEAKER_05]: development program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Initial tetraploid production mothers for
these projects include a number of really
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting inbred lineages derived from
Chem D, Triangle Kush, Durban Poison,
[SPEAKER_05]: California Orange, Trainwreck,
Urkel, and some of our own internal lines
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're really excited to pair these
tetraploid production mothers with some
[SPEAKER_05]: special new day neutral varieties to
create basically the same type of award
[SPEAKER_05]: winning hybrids that we've done on the
hemp market, but bring them to the THC
[SPEAKER_05]: side.
[SPEAKER_05]: So while these advancements offer a lot of
hope for the future of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: production, we're really stoked to make it
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're happening in real time and
subjected to the whims of an unpredictable
[SPEAKER_05]: market, which fundamentally challenges
every producer's right to exist on a daily
[SPEAKER_05]: basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope that these plants will give
farmers a fighting chance to realize their
[SPEAKER_05]: own dreams as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, we'll end for today and
take questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You did mention at the last part of your
closing here about the THC market.
[SPEAKER_10]: And does this mean that the triploid
intention is not really available in the
[SPEAKER_10]: THC market?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's currently not available in triploid
form.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: About three months.
[SPEAKER_10]: Meaning no one else is doing it either,
as far as you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Meaning no one else is doing it either,
as far as you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one other company that's working
on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, I'm sure there's other
companies working on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in terms of being available in the
market, there are none right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very nice talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my question is, I want to ask about the
environmental suitability of the triploid.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it seems that the string that you're
starting with, in fact, no string that we
[SPEAKER_08]: are growing right now in the US,
none of them are selected for the growing
[SPEAKER_08]: environment in the US.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just wondering, have you looked into
the growth, the environmental parameter
[SPEAKER_08]: that would be suitable?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that would fit the growth
environment in the US.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the range that you can possibly
grow this triploid plant in the US?
[SPEAKER_08]: And if not, is there any interest for
research to look into those parameter,
[SPEAKER_08]: to figure out where we can grow this in
the United States?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to apologize.
[SPEAKER_05]: The audio is terrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I just want to ask about the
environmental suitability of the triploid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very nice talk, by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wondering, have you figured out
where we can grow this in the US,
[SPEAKER_08]: like in terms of the temperature range,
photo period, you know, like those?
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can grow them anywhere in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_05]: The photo period response is similar,
regardless of whether you're in Vermont or
[SPEAKER_05]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are hybrids that have been
designed in a very particular way to allow
[SPEAKER_05]: farmers to grow them and get them
basically harvested and out of fields by
[SPEAKER_05]: early October.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you're specifically talking about,
and I saw the previous presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can basically grow industrial hemp,
which is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just a single gene difference
between, in most cases, a single gene
[SPEAKER_05]: difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can grow them anywhere with a hemp
license, so anywhere in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome, so I appreciate the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually an environmental
biologist, and everything you just said
[SPEAKER_00]: and the exact question that he just asked
is exactly where I'm going with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually part of the Midwest Hemp
Database Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use surfer haze and white CBG,
I think it is, as part of our cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: check program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send those seeds across the Midwest and
grow them in different environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you all looked at any epigenetics or
epigenetic data as to why some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, they are still all
compliant, but they're showing different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you all looked into any different
epigenetic stuff in those different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk afterwards then.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's really cool, and it's worth
mentioning, PacBio just released a brand
[SPEAKER_05]: new tool that goes along with their
sequencing that allows for the detection
[SPEAKER_05]: of methylation in whole genome reads,
which is opening up a whole, like this is
[SPEAKER_05]: like, everything they've been doing has
been revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the next phase in revolutionary
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to directly answer the questions in
terms of different varieties, the problem
[SPEAKER_05]: that we ran into is that different
varieties in different locations ended up
[SPEAKER_05]: producing some seeds in certain
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't, there were genotype specific
differences, but what we ended up seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: is that the genotype differences sometimes
would change depending on which area that
[SPEAKER_05]: it was in.
[SPEAKER_05]: There weren't enough samples to be able to
really pull that apart, so we do need more
[SPEAKER_05]: data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we didn't see the same outcome in the
university field trials or our own
[SPEAKER_05]: internal trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's basically one of those unfortunate
situations where you just have to say,
[SPEAKER_05]: we need more data to make a good claim.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at this point, there is something
interesting going on, and we just don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sharon's my name.
[SPEAKER_11]: Curious question.
[SPEAKER_11]: The colchicine that you're using at the
initial stage, is that the same
[SPEAKER_11]: anti-inflammatory drug?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's great for gout.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so are you using it as the
anti-inflammatory to suppress or?
[SPEAKER_05]: In specific doses, it stops microtubule.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to pretend that I know what
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, don't think I'll understand either.
[SPEAKER_05]: It stops chromosomes from dividing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It stops cells from dividing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so instead of getting that division
phase, you basically just get a
[SPEAKER_05]: replication phase, and you end up with
four sets instead of two.
[SPEAKER_05]: So rather than an anti-inflammatory,
it's actually, at a cellular level,
[SPEAKER_05]: stopping things from dividing.
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason I ask that question is
colchicine just recently, well,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's being used in cardiovascular disease,
which is an off-market claim.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's on the endothelial of the
vascular system to stop that plaque
[SPEAKER_11]: replication.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was an interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's funny how certain things that
are developed for one application can end
[SPEAKER_05]: up having a million different uses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the plant breeding world,
it's widely used for stopping cell
[SPEAKER_05]: division.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing such amazing
information with the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really an honorable thing that you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question was about germination rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I missed, did you have any
issues with germination rates or failure
[SPEAKER_02]: to thrive with some of the triploids?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that is a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we've noticed is even in diploids,
we have varying rates of basically
[SPEAKER_05]: conditioning that has to happen for
certain varieties of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are immediately ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can germinate them the week after
they're harvested, and you'll get 100%
[SPEAKER_05]: germination.
[SPEAKER_05]: Others, you have to wait up to six months.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to go through a conditioning
process, stratification process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Triploids are more impacted by that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tetraploids, even more impacted by that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing it in regeneration as well,
taking cuttings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Triploids are much faster to basically
clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tetraploids are a little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we go up the ploidy chain,
the higher you go, the more difficult they
[SPEAKER_05]: are to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So most definitely, a ploidy relationship
between dormancy and seed, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate the talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is building off the coltazine
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Curious if you're seeing any other notable
mutations following that, and maybe that
[SPEAKER_07]: might be involved in your environmental
epigenetic expressions that you're seeing
[SPEAKER_07]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a fantastic question.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of my biggest concerns.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just spent the last three and a half
years developing this plant, line breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're going to put a mutagen on it
and expect us to make seed with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out of here, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have sequenced, using the older CLR
technology, we sequenced the first
[SPEAKER_05]: tetraploid that we made.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't see any differences, but I don't
trust the older technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in the process of getting sequencing
data and doing the comparison right now
[SPEAKER_05]: through a graduate student project at
Oregon State University, taking a
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoid free plant that we basically
gave the university to work with that went
[SPEAKER_05]: through the same process.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have underlying sequence data from the
diploid form, and now we're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: doing the sequencing and comparing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, we do see some strange things when
it doesn't stick.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have a reversion on part of the
plant, you'll end up seeing phenotypical
[SPEAKER_05]: differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the most part, there really isn't
widespread mutations that people would
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes think about, like with gamma
radiation or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to be true to type phenotypically
anyway, just better.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a diploid plant that's great,
best way to make it better is to turn it
[SPEAKER_05]: into a tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantastic talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is about the THC seeds that
you referred to at the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a distribution model set up
that we could get seeds in California?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, go to gtrseeds.com, enter your
credit card information, and we'd happily
[SPEAKER_05]: take your money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, from a regulatory
compliance standpoint, if we're bringing
[SPEAKER_06]: in seeds into California that's coming
from another state, how are we going to
[SPEAKER_06]: get that into our metric systems and
compliance?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is all that going to be taken care of
through interstate orders?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is part of the problem is that it's
state to state.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dependent on each individual state.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that we're covering our
backsides on is our legality to make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: that we can send them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're sent out as industrial hemp seeds,
which are completely 100% legal in the
[SPEAKER_05]: United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's up to the individual cultivators or
home growers who buy them to check with
[SPEAKER_05]: their local authorities and regulations
before popping the seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great question, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your nice talk and nice
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is related to the natural
tetraploid plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you isolated from Himalaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you sequence the genome, and did you
mine for good alleles that could explain
[SPEAKER_01]: its resilience to this climatic,
to this climate?
[SPEAKER_01]: The resilience can be due to the doubling,
the number of genes, but also accepting
[SPEAKER_01]: mutations in the second genome without
being lethal for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering if you mind for very
good allele or?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was in reference to the Indian
tetraploid population?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I haven't been able to get
in contact with that group that did the
[SPEAKER_05]: research.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been trying for about two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anybody has any way to get a hold of
them, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very curious, because it's such a
unique population for all those reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be amazing to just get the
germplasm so that we can look at what
[SPEAKER_05]: makes it different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it has evolved a lot on the
second genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has accumulated some potential
beneficial mutations, and it would be nice
[SPEAKER_01]: to sequence this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, do you have an idea why tetraploids
haven't evolved everywhere on Earth?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if they are producing more,
if they are more resilient, why the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution didn't make this tetraploid to
colonize Earth?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm really sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a strong accent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm usually really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering why evolution didn't keep
tetraploids instead of diploids,
[SPEAKER_05]: if they are growing better, having a- In
the triploid population?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, why just tetraploids haven't colonized
Earth?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, god.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a huge question.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not an expert in the area.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would defer to people who really do
study polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_05]: My best guess at this, and from everything
that I've gathered, is that you have more
[SPEAKER_05]: gene copies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes you more resilient in places
where there's challenges.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we see is that a lot of the invasive
species that really make headway across
[SPEAKER_05]: ecological regions are polyploids,
and they end up, for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_05]: being better at succeeding in those areas,
which is super interesting because
[SPEAKER_05]: fertility is almost universally lower in
higher-ploidy plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're making up for that lowered
fertility with a better adaptability,
[SPEAKER_05]: is what it seems like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The balance between seed production and
resilience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_05]: We only have so many years, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got to choose your investigations
wisely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, thank you for your great presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work in indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious to know if you guys have
studied using triploid plants in indoor
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation, or if you have any plants to
do so, and what kinds of advantages do you
[SPEAKER_03]: think there would be to using triploid
plants in indoors?
[SPEAKER_05]: Using triploid plants indoors?
[SPEAKER_05]: Triploid plants, and I would say
tetraploid plants, are dramatically
[SPEAKER_05]: superior to diploid plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just obtained a couple THC production
licenses in Oregon, specifically in
[SPEAKER_05]: preparation for national legalization,
and we don't grow anything except
[SPEAKER_05]: converted tetraploids in that facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Triploids are great as well, but in terms
of getting something true to type very
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly, the fastest thing for us to do is
develop a plant variety at the diploid
[SPEAKER_05]: phase, convert it to a tetraploid,
and then put it into production.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, you have never experienced
cannabis until you walk into a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_05]: full of triploids or tetraploids compared
to a diploid environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the ultimate expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about to flower the 8X plant,
the octaploid.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's better, I'll tell you next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so far, so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
