[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to give you an overview of
cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been involved in it for the last
50, 55 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow me to start by a poem by Rainer
Maria Rilke written about 120 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I live my life in widening
circles that reach out across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not complete the last one,
but I give myself to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is as if in some way,
he's describing what's going on with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started with a small circle and
expanded, and the expansion is going on
[SPEAKER_00]: and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started work many years ago,
there was essentially no interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, cannabinoid research,
the effects of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, when I asked for a
grant, I was told by NIH, when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: something more relevant, to the US,
contact us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids or cannabis is not of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used sometimes in Mexico,
but not in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that changed quite fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today there is a huge, huge interest
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, the journal Nature
had four reviews, four scientific reviews
[SPEAKER_00]: on this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is one of them, which I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows the brain and the cannabis
growing out of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is this change, why has this
happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it seems that cannabinoids or the
endogenous cannabinoids, and I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about them, are involved in a huge
amount of diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, two senior scientists
at NIH recently wrote a review,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the review says modulating
endocannabinoid activity is essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in all human diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even if this is 95% correct,
then it is something of extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know of any other
neurotransmitter that we can say that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is involved in so many diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll be talking about on this topic
for a few moments later, but let's go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and start with three, 4,000 years ago,
when the Assyrians actually used
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids or used cannabis for those
purposes that we use them today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used cannabis to cause what they
said, the drug that takes away the mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not such a bad definition
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: For getting high, they used it for some
diseases, apparently neurological
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases, and it seems that they used it
in some of their religious rites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we started work on
cannabinoids, I was surprised to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: that while morphine had been isolated from
opium almost 200 years previously,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cocaine had been isolated from cocaine
and sugar leaves during the 19th century,
[SPEAKER_00]: the active compound in cannabis had never
been purified or extracted, and its
[SPEAKER_00]: structure was unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead and started isolating the
compounds present in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we found about a dozen compounds,
and only one of these compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrahydrocannabinoid, which we isolated
in pure form, I believe for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time, turned out to be psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other compounds were not of major
interest at that time, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we found out that in Lebanese
hashish, which we received from the police
[SPEAKER_00]: and which we used for many years,
contains two major constructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constituents, cannabidiol and
tetrahydrocannabinoid, THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: While THC, as I said, is psychoactive,
cannabidiol is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with a well-known
cannabis-like activity, but it is a major
[SPEAKER_00]: drug, and many of the diseases that are
being treated today with cannabis are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually affected by cannabidiol and much
less than by THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead looking for the
activities of these compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of the first activities we looked
at was epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done in collaboration with a
group in South America, and we looked
[SPEAKER_00]: first in mice, and then when we had enough
data, we went to humans, and we found that
[SPEAKER_00]: in a group of 15 patients, half of them
were placebo, didn't get any material,
[SPEAKER_00]: and half of them got CBD at high doses,
those eight patients that got CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: four did not have any attacks,
or essentially no attacks, three had many
[SPEAKER_00]: less attacks, and one was not affected at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, unfortunately, these were results were
not picked up by the neurologists for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years, and only in the last decade have
children with epilepsy being given
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis with high doses of cannabidiol,
and a lot of them are being, can I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: even saved by using this particular type
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, another group of diseases that's
being affected by cannabidiol is graft
[SPEAKER_00]: versus host disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, many cancer diseases,
there should be a bone marrow transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the body doesn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a bone marrow transplant is done,
the body attacks the new bone marrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: the new bone marrow attacks the body,
and the patient is sick, at times very
[SPEAKER_00]: sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a kind of autoimmune
disease, namely the body attacks something
[SPEAKER_00]: within the body, and so a group at one of
the hospitals here thought on the basis of
[SPEAKER_00]: other effects which had been seen,
autoimmune effects of the same type,
[SPEAKER_00]: they decided to try cannabidiol,
and they gave cannabidiol to a large
[SPEAKER_00]: number of patients that had bone marrow
transplantation, and indeed, in many
[SPEAKER_00]: cases, they showed that these patients do
not develop the graft versus host disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, here are some of their
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two in four grade is a low grade disease,
and while about 50% of patients that do
[SPEAKER_00]: not get cannabidiol have graft versus host
disease in a little bit of a mild form,
[SPEAKER_00]: only a small number, only 12%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those that got cannabidiol were
affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that had a very serious graft versus
host disease, which are about 10%,
[SPEAKER_00]: only 5% got the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we have something of a clinical
value, and at the moment, this research is
[SPEAKER_00]: going on, and it is going on very
successfully, and I sincerely believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: within a few years, cannabidiol will
become the central drug, the major drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: in graft versus host disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, diabetes type 1, again, is an
autoimmune disease, namely the body
[SPEAKER_00]: attacks, for reasons that we do not know,
attacks the cells that produce insulin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this happens particularly in children.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is known as pediatric diabetes,
and new drugs are definitely needed for
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of disease, and we tried in
mice, unfortunately, only we have not been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get into humans yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that in mice that have,
that all of them develop diabetes type 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we give them cannabidiol, we can reduce
the amount, the number of mice that get
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes type 1 to about 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the slide, you can see that
the cells that produce insulin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see that on the last part of
the slide, the percent of the cells that
[SPEAKER_00]: produce insulin and are partially
destroyed, the number is huge,
[SPEAKER_00]: 77% of the cells are being attacked,
and are not intact anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that got cannabidiol, only 7,
8, 10% got the cells were attacked,
[SPEAKER_00]: so here we have a very promising situation
for a disease that is not well treated
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the diseases that
cannabidiol can be used for, but
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol has to be used in a huge
number of, a huge amount of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another field, in schizophrenia,
patients were given 700 to 800 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to get good results, and as it
happens with many other drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: one has to develop derivatives which are,
can be used at lower levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we recently reported that if
we take cannabidiol and make a derivative,
[SPEAKER_00]: a derivative in which there is a fluorine
atom on the molecule, the level,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of material needed is much
lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that within a few years,
we shall have both cannabidiol and
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorocannabidiol on the market against
many of the autoimmune diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: and quite a few others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for many years after the chemistry of
cannabinoids became known, we learned
[SPEAKER_00]: about the biochemistry, the pharmacology,
as I mentioned, a few clinical effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that we didn't know was what is
the mechanism of cannabis action,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's THC or CBD, but particularly
THC, what is the mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was thought previously that the
mechanism is non-specific, whatever that
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, non-specific means that we cannot
really find any well-established
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is, how does one look for
non-specific mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a molecule that can exist in
two, two types, if you wish, mirror images
[SPEAKER_00]: of each other, a non-specific mode of
action, both molecules will act.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a specific mode of action,
only one of them will act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we found that indeed only the
natural cannabidiol or the natural THC
[SPEAKER_00]: work, the mirror image does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we established that there will be some
specific mechanism, and indeed within a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years, Alan Howlett in the US found a
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The receptor was found in the brain,
and it is widely spread in the brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one of the most, one of the
receptors that found in the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But receptors don't exist because there is
a plant out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Receptors exist because animals,
we produce compounds that affect these
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead looking for the compounds
in our body, endogenous compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will affect these receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after work for quite a few years with
colleagues that came from the state and a
[SPEAKER_00]: colleague that came from the Czech state,
we found a compound called which we called
[SPEAKER_00]: anandamide, and we found also another
compound which we called 2AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: These compounds are found throughout the
body, and particularly in the brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and particularly in those areas of the
brain, which you can see on the slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the receptor is found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two compounds have a completely
different structure than the natural plant
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are, they have the same activity,
more or less, and they also, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant product, do not dissolve in water,
they dissolve only in lipids, and they act
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same way with one difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are formed when needed, they're
broken when needed, but the plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: stays for a longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has been a huge, huge amount of
work, and you call this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: research as the second phase of
cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first phase is the work on the plant
cannabinoids, the second phase is the work
[SPEAKER_00]: on the endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will not go into biochemistry,
of course, except one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are these compounds, whether it is the
plant compound or whether these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that we produce, the endogenous
cannabinoids, effective in so many
[SPEAKER_00]: biological things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in so many diseases?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing they do is they regulate
the activities of many other
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nerve is not a string going from one
place to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nerves in the body are broken down,
and that's called the synapse,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the synapse is in our body because in
this way the body can regulate nerve
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the synapse, there are chemicals which
move from one side of the synapse to
[SPEAKER_00]: another, these are the neuro compounds
that are neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the endogenous cannabinoids regulate
the release of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sit on the part of the synapse,
the post-synapse, where needed,
[SPEAKER_00]: they move to the presynapse and there they
activate the receptor and they affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: production or the release of these
neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line is they, the endogenous
cannabinoids, regulate to a large extent
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in the brain, what's going
on with neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make a long story short,
the endogenous cannabinoid system today is
[SPEAKER_00]: known to have two receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CB1 receptor is the one when
stimulated causes the activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoid activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is of a protective nature
and it has nothing to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactivity of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course there are the two
endogenous compounds, anandamide and 2-AG,
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are of course the enzymes,
those enzymes that form the endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds and those enzymes that break
them down and by playing with these
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes we can actually enhance the
activity, enhance the amount of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endogenous compounds or we can even leave
them for a much longer time in the body by
[SPEAKER_00]: blocking the enzymes that break them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course there is the THC and
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a huge amount of work going on
and these compounds are known now to
[SPEAKER_00]: affect, as I said previously, a long list
of things that are going on in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can look at the list that I
have on this slide, it starts with anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: and blood pressure and the digestive
system, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it goes down to stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I have a full list, I'll probably
need another two or three slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me tell you some of the activity
of the endogenous compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the activities of the endogenous
compounds is a protective activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: a protective activity in the brain
together with colleagues of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Esti Shohami.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at what happens to the brain
when it has been slightly damaged,
[SPEAKER_00]: brain of mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that one of the endogenous
compounds, the 2AG, and it is in the red
[SPEAKER_00]: on the slide you have, the 2AG goes up
about 10 times after even a slight damage
[SPEAKER_00]: to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is that because the brain has been
damaged and it doesn't do what it should
[SPEAKER_00]: do, or is that some kind of a protective
mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we synthesized 2AG and gave it to mice
that had undergone closed head injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that indeed those mice that
received cannabidiol had much less damage
[SPEAKER_00]: in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The damage can be seen in the white part
in the slide in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The damage goes about 50% less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a typical effect of the
endogenous cannabinoids, neuro protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we and many other groups looked at a
huge number of effects, but some of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects were not as strong as we
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, on brain injury, there is
vasoconstriction of the blood vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And endogenous cannabinoids do affect
vasoconstriction, and vasoconstriction is
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the body seems to act, to have
something that affects much more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started looking for, maybe we have
additional compounds, additional
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed we found that there are
compounds that are closely related to the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids, but do not act as
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not bind to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not have many other activities,
but they definitely act on the
[SPEAKER_00]: vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one compound of this type,
as you can see on the slide, it is closely
[SPEAKER_00]: related to the other compound,
but it doesn't bind to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is formed from fatty acid bound to an
amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amino acid in this case is serine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular compound, we see it
and it has been accepted as an
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid-like compound found in the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we know that there is a huge,
huge number of compounds of that type,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 120 compounds of that type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know very little about the
activities of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in this case, we know,
as I spoke about as arachidoneal serine,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does not bind to the receptor,
but its activity can be blocked by an
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonist to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very strange, because how can a compound
which does not bind to the receptor can be
[SPEAKER_00]: blocked by an antagonist?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know why this happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, that's what it
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is something that we have to look
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a completely different area,
bone remodeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were surprised to see that osteoporosis
can be affected by compounds of this type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a long history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is known in the Middle East that there
is less osteoporosis than in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is believed that this happens
because people in the Middle East use more
[SPEAKER_00]: olive oil than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at the presence of compounds
of this type in olive oil and we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: find anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we decided maybe one of the
constituents of olive oil, in this case a
[SPEAKER_00]: compound called oleic acid, is metabolized
in the body to a compound that's very
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we prepared a few metabolites,
new compounds, and yes, we found that the
[SPEAKER_00]: compound closely related to anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in the slide the structure
of anandamide and the structure of this
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite of oleic acid, oleic serine,
which does not bind to the receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: does not cause the effects of anandamide,
but is a very potent anti-ostoporotic
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have mice and we cause osteoporosis
in mice, and there are ways of doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bones are affected, then you can
see in the middle, the red is the affected
[SPEAKER_00]: bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start giving these mice this
particular cannabinoid-like compound
[SPEAKER_00]: formed in the body, formed in the bones,
we can see that the bones start
[SPEAKER_00]: recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start regrowing ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a huge number of
biological, physiological effects that
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be looked at because we know,
as I mentioned previously, that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 120 compounds of this type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have looked at these two and there
are many others that have to be evaluated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me try to summarize what I have
been talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the endocannabinoids are involved
in a huge number of biological effects and
[SPEAKER_00]: we can expect to have, to see many others,
as many, many groups are working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that cannabidiol is an important
compound, although it doesn't cause the
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is the third group of compounds
that people are just looking into now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are anandamide-like compounds,
which are like anandamide, formed from a
[SPEAKER_00]: fatty acid bound to an amino acid or a
derivative of amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these compounds seem to be effective
in a huge number of physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sincerely hope that within the next
three years, we shall see drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly of this third type of
endocannabinoid-like compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a compound attack specifically on the
CB2 system, which has no marijuana-like
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank many of my
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a list of some of my collaborators
in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are my students, some of them
are colleagues in departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say thanks to many other
colleagues abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on the slide some of my
collaborators abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that they stretch from the
UK in Aberdeen, my good friend Pertwee,
[SPEAKER_00]: through the Czech state and Greece and
Richmond in the US and even Siberia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I visited all these places except Siberia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too cold for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
