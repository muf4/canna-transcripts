[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing who will be part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: CanMed 2020 conference in Pasadena,
California, September 20th through 22nd.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_02]: puts on the CanMed conference every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Head over to CanMedEvents.com to learn
more about this year's CanMed 2020 event
[SPEAKER_02]: and purchase your ticket at our early bird
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this episode, we talk with CanMed 2020
presenter Eloise Thiessen of Radical
[SPEAKER_02]: Health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eloise is a board certified adult
geriatric nurse practitioner with over 20
[SPEAKER_02]: years experience in nursing.
[SPEAKER_02]: She started her own cannabis practice
about six years ago and since then has
[SPEAKER_02]: treated more than 6,000 patients with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are very few healthcare
professionals nationally with the same
[SPEAKER_02]: level of expertise and experience as
Eloise.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is also the president of the American
Cannabis Nurses Association and will serve
[SPEAKER_02]: as the president through 2022.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eloise made her first CanMed appearance at
our 2019 event in a presentation sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: her experience using cannabis to treat
geriatric patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about some of the unique
challenges that come with working with
[SPEAKER_02]: seniors including the stigma older
patients have towards cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: how the endocannabinoid system changes as
we age, and navigating drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are excited to have Eloise as a
presenter at CanMed 2020 this year,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that will not be her only contribution
to the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eloise will also be an instructor at a
full-day medical practicum along with Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonnie Goldstein, Dr. Dustin Sulak,
and Dr. Kevin Spellman.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great opportunity for healthcare
professionals to learn about the latest
[SPEAKER_02]: research into cannabinoid therapies and
also tap into the deep clinical experience
[SPEAKER_02]: the instructors have to offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you consider that most medical
schools don't teach the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system, courses like this are really the
only way healthcare providers can learn
[SPEAKER_02]: how to properly administer cannabinoid
therapies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Attendees will walk away with practical
information about the different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: extractions and products that are on the
market and optimal dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Due to federal guidelines, CME credits for
physicians are not available for the
[SPEAKER_02]: practicum.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the course is approved by the
California Board of Registered Nursing for
[SPEAKER_02]: 9.5 contact hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn more at canmedevents.com slash
practicum.
[SPEAKER_02]: The practicum kicks off this year's CanMed
2020 event on September 20th, and will be
[SPEAKER_02]: followed by two full days of oral and
poster presentations about the latest
[SPEAKER_02]: research into cannabis science,
medicine, cultivation, and safety testing.

[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Eloise
[SPEAKER_02]: Thiessen of Radical Health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, Eloise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very excited to have you as part of
CanMed 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you're going to be quite busy
out there because you're wearing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: hats for us this year, which we definitely
appreciate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a member of the advisory board,
which is excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're helping us weed through all the
abstracts and select the best speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be an oral presenter
again, which we're very excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're also a big part of our medical
practicum, which is going to be a great
[SPEAKER_02]: addition to this year's event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you come from a nursing
background, which I think is going to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice addition to this year's
practicum or CME event.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if you could speak a
bit more about what that practicum is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be a jam-packed day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're planning on doing about nine
and a half hours' worth of content for
[SPEAKER_00]: those who attend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited that we're going to
be covering pediatrics to geriatrics,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at chronic pain, looking at a
panel for dosing, kind of talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: how we as clinicians approach patients
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to have some really
exciting content that they won't find
[SPEAKER_00]: during the regular CanMed presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really did try to make sure when we
were looking at abstracts that we had good
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity among topics and stuff that
people would get excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I'm not mistaken, that medical
practicum will be some continuing
[SPEAKER_02]: education nursing credits will be
available for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had a hard time getting continuing
education credits for physicians and
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacists, but I'm a continuing
education provider in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm able to offer nursing continuing
education credits for nurses, nurse
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced practice, nurse practitioners
that come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine and a half hours' worth of continuing
education credits towards their license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in advance of this call, I did watch
your CanMed 2019 presentation again,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage everyone to go and check that
out on canmedevents.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll drop a link in the show description.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that you mentioned is that
we need to get more nurses educated about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and more involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that you are president of the
American Cannabis Nurses Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if you could speak a
bit about what you all do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're a national nursing organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're celebrating our 10th year this year,
hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was started back in 2010 by Mary Lynn
Mathri and a few others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now at about 1,350 members.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few in Canada and Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have some global presence as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our mission really is to improve
nursing excellence through education,
[SPEAKER_00]: advocacy, research, policy development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been working really hard to get
more eyes on us because we really do feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like nurses are going to help lead the
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We outnumber physicians five to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really are the boots on the ground,
the workforce in the medical community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people have seen that with COVID,
how nurses have really been on the front
[SPEAKER_00]: lines caring for these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the more that we can get nurses
educated, the more patients we can reach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that stood out to me
from your presentation is you had
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned you were talking with dispensary
owners and they had said that it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: uncommon for them to spend a half hour to
an hour with new patients, mostly seniors
[SPEAKER_02]: who are trying to kind of navigate their
cannabis journey and try to figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: what's good for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to imagine from a clinician
perspective, that's got to be a little
[SPEAKER_02]: concerning that these patients are kind of
going to the dispensary for this medical
[SPEAKER_02]: education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as knowledgeable as they are in most
dispensaries, they're not clinicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, in California, it's very clear
that you're not to give any medical
[SPEAKER_00]: advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's sort of this, you know,
it's this, I don't know if I want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: catch-22, but it's awkward because most
clinicians don't want to be referred to as
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot doc or the pot nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not necessarily interested in
getting into this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still concerned the fact that it's
a schedule one drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often, you know, the dispensary staff
are the first ones to meet the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're there for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, you know, as a clinician,
I'm grateful that they have someone to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see an increase in scope
of, you know, some standardization around
[SPEAKER_00]: scope of practice, some, you know,
mandatory training so that we can have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at least some consistency in,
you know, how we approach patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when should they be referring
them to a clinician, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's, there's such a high turnover
rate and the dispensaries in California
[SPEAKER_00]: that you get a lot of myths and
misconceptions get repeated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as a clinician, I've had my
patients go to the dispensary to pick up
[SPEAKER_00]: their cannabis and then the dispensary
staff will contradict what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be really confusing to the
patient, you know, they're already scared
[SPEAKER_00]: and overwhelmed and intimidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they go into an environment that
their, you know, clinicians advice is
[SPEAKER_00]: being contraindicated, it really puts them
in an awkward position, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, what am I supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they can be really,
you know, we can be very passionate about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be very convincing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes from both ends, you know,
the dispensary staff and the clinicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just worry about seniors who,
you know, have a high risk of drug to drug
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions or a high risk for falls,
potentially getting information that could
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to an adverse event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they never use it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that you had
mentioned there was kind of referring to a
[SPEAKER_02]: clinician.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that, is that something that's sort
of common for maybe dispensaries to be
[SPEAKER_02]: referring patients to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that not how you're you're seeing
most of your patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, well, I have a few companies that I've
worked with here locally in the Bay Area
[SPEAKER_00]: that that know I'm here and will refer,
you know, some of the more complex
[SPEAKER_00]: patients or customers that come to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my referrals now are coming from
some of the larger health systems like UC
[SPEAKER_00]: Davis, Stanford, UCS staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those physicians and clinicians refer
there are very complex patients to me who
[SPEAKER_00]: want to use cannabis as a treatment for
things like chronic pain, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: depression, sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's exciting to me that we're seeing
that shift where it's I know my patients
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My policy, my hospital policy doesn't
allow me to really engage with the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's a trusted clinician.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a really good sign that the
doctors are are opening up to to the idea
[SPEAKER_02]: of using cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know with the population you're
working with, there is certainly a stigma
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how difficult is that to sort of
navigate when you when you're taking on
[SPEAKER_02]: new patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it still catches me off
guard sometimes, you know, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just to see how deep the stigma goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we will see patients come in who
are still arms crossed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: against that, you know, their body
language is very, you know, shut off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, I can't believe I'm here
talking to you about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're almost a little bit like angry
or irritated that they've, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_00]: resorted to this drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often by the end of the consultation
through education, they start to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: open up and see a little bit differently
and, you know, building that trusting
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with them and giving them the
space to be uncomfortable and to be
[SPEAKER_00]: hesitant and to explore those with them
really helps them, I think, become more
[SPEAKER_00]: open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are times when I've met with
people who are so still so hesitant and
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant that I will be very honest with
them and say, this isn't going to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with you unless you keep an open mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so sometimes they're bringing
they're putting up such big roadblocks
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're not going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may still have one lady I've been
treating for over five years who hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: told her adult children that she's using
it, because she spent her whole life
[SPEAKER_00]: telling them to stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guilt and shame that she has
around it, and I'm like, they know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you tell them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's your success?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you what are you sharing with
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, Oh, I just tell them,
you know, I'm just doing alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if they can read between the
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, kids are a lot
smarter than you think they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if they're adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing I was curious about
with, you know, working with older
[SPEAKER_02]: patients is when I spoke with Dr. Bonnie
Goldstein, a few episodes ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised to learn that children
sort of tolerate the effects of THC better
[SPEAKER_02]: than adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: She needs to actually kind of increase the
dose for children.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, is that the same or
similar with seniors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they sort of have a difference in
sensitivity to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's yes, it's the opposite,
though, they tend to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we age, our metabolism slows down,
our ability to process medications
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases by about 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often they need less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had sometimes where I can I had
one gentleman who was responding to zero
[SPEAKER_00]: point three three milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had given it to him daily and he was
still having adverse effects from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did it every three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was his dose that he tolerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that they are more likely to
have side effects and that low dosages are
[SPEAKER_00]: often enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they don't even need it
daily because, you know, they're building
[SPEAKER_00]: it's building up and accumulating and then
they don't eliminate it as quickly as kids
[SPEAKER_00]: will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I suppose that's a good thing in
terms of cost savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, especially with taxes making it
so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing I wanted to go back to,
you said, you know, a lot of your first
[SPEAKER_02]: consultations with folks sometimes is a
lot about education.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious what are sort of the the
resources or the tools you use for
[SPEAKER_02]: education that seem to to resonate with
your patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've learned over the years to have
a lot of backup materials, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I am fortunate enough to have,
you know, 30 to 45 minutes with each new
[SPEAKER_00]: patient to really sit with them and and
understand their health history and help,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, talk about their goals and then
educate them on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's it's such a steep
learning curve that they tend to forget a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a lot of reinforcement with
materials and handouts that I provide
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the the conversation I love
having with them is talking about that
[SPEAKER_00]: euphoria that they're so scared of,
because it's, you know, the the one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that they'll come in, you know,
often and say, don't you dare recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, they usually say prescribed,
you know, don't you dare prescribe THC for
[SPEAKER_00]: me, Eloise?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'll usually smile really
big and say, well, tell me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it mean to get high?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this great conversation about
euphoria and how, you know, it can help
[SPEAKER_00]: them be more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe more communicate to with their
spouse and improve their mood,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and help them them just feel
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, when you present it to
them that way, they're like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't sound so bad, you know,
giving them that permission to to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: good, because, you know, we're encouraged
to find recreation in so many areas of our
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that recreation is cannabis,
we're shamed for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So giving them that permission and
educating them on it usually really it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it improves their quality of life
greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so typically, what sort of are the the
ratios that you're using to treat the
[SPEAKER_02]: different conditions that that you're
presented with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I always like to say,
it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I do find gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do find differences among males and
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of what I'll be presenting
at Can Med with the dementia population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I I like to start out with
one cannabinoid at a time again,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the older adult tends to be more
sensitive and they're more likely to have
[SPEAKER_00]: drug to drug interactions or even side
effects from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can isolate, you know, one
cannabinoid at a time, I have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if they're having a
reaction, you know, it's clearly it's THC
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's clearly CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cases where I will be a little
bit more aggressive and start out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like a one to one for pain of CBD and
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times it's sort of one
cannabinoid building on the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't go to ratios too often because
I like to individualize it so much for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things I had prepared to ask
was, are you on the side of whole plant or
[SPEAKER_02]: isolated compounds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems from that answer that you're
more in the camp of the isolated
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know that I pick isolated
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pick whole plant THC products or whole
plant CBD products or full spectrum CBG or
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will always be minor other
cannabinoids in there, but the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be, you know, a CBD dominant
regimen that I start out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have some small amounts of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not, you know, I rarely use
isolates, but I'm not opposed to them
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are some some cases where it
seems appropriate, but it's the minority.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so are some terpenes getting involved
there, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish that we did a better job of
providing a COA to to consumers and
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and clinicians so that we could
identify these cannabinoid terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles and then, you know, use that to
be able to to repeat it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what what this profile is that's
working so well so that it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatable instead of going in and telling
them, oh, we'll go back and get OG Kush or
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream or, you know, some of these
chemovar names that really aren't a good
[SPEAKER_00]: indication of what's in what's in the
product and may be misleading and not
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually just recently spoke with Cindy
Orser, who is a she's on the lab test lab
[SPEAKER_02]: testing side, and she was really talking
about the importance of testing for
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes and how that's sort of a blind
spot for a lot of patients or a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are just going there and seeing the
THC CBD and then kind of making
[SPEAKER_02]: assumptions on a product based on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they could really have a very
different experience based on the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes at this really interesting
case just last week where this woman had
[SPEAKER_00]: an incredibly complex medical history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was a little intimidated by it
and I was looking at her allergy list and
[SPEAKER_00]: she was allergic to black pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, Well, tell me what your
allergy is to black pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, Oh, I get like an itchy
throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Do you have a hard time
breathing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to see the severity of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Okay, well, this product that
I'm about to recommend to you has beta
[SPEAKER_00]: carotene in it, which, you know,
is thought to, we know comes from black
[SPEAKER_00]: pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to, you know, make sure
we're monitoring you for potential side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects or an allergic reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she started out at a low dose and
was tolerating it quite well, checked in
[SPEAKER_00]: with her on day five and she was doing
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she increased her dose that night
and woke up with hives all over her body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to assume that she was having an
allergic reaction to the increased dose
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the beta carotene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, how about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So are there any terpenes that you tend to
favor in when you're kind of recommending
[SPEAKER_02]: products for your patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely beta carotene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can find linalool and Mersene,
I'll definitely use those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but again, it can be hard to
identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to use companies that I
know are sort of vertically integrated and
[SPEAKER_00]: are using the same chemovars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, once I've identified those
products in the terpene cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: profile, I like to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm like, OK, we'll likely get
some consistency here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, a lot of products today are
distillates and it's kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: really geek out on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing that came up when I was
talking to Cindy was that a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: producers, manufacturers are now actually
putting in terpenes into their blends and
[SPEAKER_02]: into vape cartridges and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And her concern was that they might
actually be overdue.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might be doing it and putting too
many terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are sort of the downstream
effects of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to listen to that as that's
definitely my concern as well as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when we're, you know,
do we know what levels of terpene should
[SPEAKER_00]: be in these products?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what are we basing it off of?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, now recently I've seen some
of these hemp companies testing their
[SPEAKER_00]: products for minerals, phosphorus,
magnesium, potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we don't have any standards
around these levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen, you know, these levels are
high of phosphorus and potassium and
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, how does that affect
the end user, especially some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who may have a history of cardiac
disease or kidney disease where they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: have these high levels of potassium or
magnesium?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is it is it impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm curious about it, you know,
just as I am with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was pretty sure I should say when
I spoke with her, she had mentioned that
[SPEAKER_02]: she had tested some products and the
terpene levels were as high as like 20
[SPEAKER_02]: percent where, yeah, where naturally
occurring in the plant, like it rarely
[SPEAKER_02]: gets higher than five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's quite the increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I told her that it might be a good
potential can med topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anyone out there is listening is
curious, please do that research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go back to the whole idea of the
stigma, but not less on the patient side
[SPEAKER_02]: here, maybe more on the provider side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the first question is,
you know, how many other geriatric
[SPEAKER_02]: providers are out there kind of treating
patients with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that number growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the number of seniors who are
using cannabis is growing, but are the
[SPEAKER_02]: number of clinicians they can turn to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that growing as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's hard for me to assess that,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, at least not at the rate that I would
like it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just so many of them are
coming to their clinicians now and asking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and their clinicians are like,
yeah, that's fine if you want to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it kind of ends there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's no real opportunities
for these seniors to get more information
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're seeing and I probably have a
skewed view of it, but I do see more
[SPEAKER_00]: nurses getting into into it around
education and advocacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, not I'm not seeing
geriatrician, you know, geriatricians get
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, with my work with the
Alzheimer dementia patients, I get a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of referrals because they don't they don't
want to or their hospital policy as they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be a situation where a patient
comes to their doctor, says they're
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in it, but they don't feel
comfortable and kind of refer to to
[SPEAKER_02]: someone like yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how does that vary from state to
state?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, you know, nurse practitioners
in some states can administer medications
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of do a full practice where in
other states it's more limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you navigate that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not you specifically, but how is
that a difficulty for some patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nurse practitioners have been trying
to get full practice authority forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in California requires a
collaborator collaborative relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a physician who is my medical
director.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some states, they can have full
practice authority where they they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to work with a physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's it's it's tough
because, you know, we're we're educated to
[SPEAKER_00]: assess and diagnose and interpret lab
results and x rays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some states say, yes, we can do
that without a physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some states say that we can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it it's it really makes no sense to
me, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just see more and more research
coming out about how nurse practitioners
[SPEAKER_00]: have better outcomes because and I talked
about this at Canada last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we spend more time with our
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're less likely to prescribe opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're less likely to have patients become
go back to the emergency room or be
[SPEAKER_00]: readmitted after they leave the hospital
because of our level of care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in California, I would say,
you know, because we have to have this
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative relationship, what has
happened is many of these physicians hire
[SPEAKER_00]: what they call us mid-level practitioners
or providers, and they can charge a
[SPEAKER_00]: physician rate for us to see a patient and
then pay us an hourly rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really does, you know, work to their
benefit financially to have nurse
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioners under a physician and not be
able to practice autonomously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just leave it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I'm familiar with nurse
practitioners, and it seems like they're
[SPEAKER_02]: really kind of filling the void in primary
care because, you know, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: there are fewer physicians who are going
into primary care or family practice
[SPEAKER_02]: because reimbursement rates and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I think you all are filling a
valuable need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tend to take more of a kind of holistic
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole body approach instead of sort of
specialized therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's hysterical to me because
that's like, you know, physicians come out
[SPEAKER_00]: of school and they don't want to get into
primary care, like you said, because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the reimbursement rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet they're blocking us from having
full practice authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, you know, like, OK,
you can't have it both ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to anyone who's listening now in and
maybe has an older relative who they think
[SPEAKER_02]: might be might benefit from cannabis
medicine, what's their first step?
[SPEAKER_02]: What could they do to help out their loved
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, if it's a serious medical,
if they have a serious medical history,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would certainly look in the area to see
if there are any, you know, knowledgeable
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis clinicians, knowledgeable CBD
clinicians who can help do a thorough
[SPEAKER_00]: health history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And determine, you know, risk versus
benefit of using the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my the thing I always tell
people is if you're going to work with a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis clinician, make sure they're
telling you, you know, how much to take,
[SPEAKER_00]: how often to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're reviewing potential side effects
that you may have from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy, potential drug to drug
interactions, and that they're they're
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring them so that they can adjust
things as they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, often people come to
cannabis and lately CBD, and they just
[SPEAKER_00]: think that it's a one and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take this and it's going to
be good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, because their friends or
other people they know are having success
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is, you know, sometimes it
can take months for us to get them the
[SPEAKER_00]: right treatment plan, especially if
they're suffering from age related and
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not a silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to just work overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I guess, where do you start?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you said it can kind of be this long
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where do you start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with me particularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, someone will book an appointment
with me and I have them fill out a very
[SPEAKER_00]: thorough health history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the appointment,
you know, discussing the goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I'll identify other things
that I think cannabis could be helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, what I do is provide
them with the treatment plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's, you know, here's the cannabinoid
profile I want you to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how I want you to obtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how I want you to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go very low and slow, obviously,
because 90% of the people that come to me
[SPEAKER_00]: are cannabis naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they haven't even touched it ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to empower them in terms of,
you know, giving them a treatment plan
[SPEAKER_00]: that says, take this dose, wait three
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your side, you know, your symptoms
are still there, then you increase it to
[SPEAKER_00]: this dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very, I spell it out for them as
much as I can, you know, so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: really can feel confident in the way that
they're approaching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that they have, again,
building that trust and giving them an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to see how it affects them and
take note of it and take a journal and
[SPEAKER_00]: write it down and start empowering them to
be more involved in their healthcare and
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody has access to somebody like
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the challenge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're in a state that's
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's, there's, you know,
obviously the American Cannabis Nurses
[SPEAKER_00]: Association, there's Society of Cannabis
Clinicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are nonprofit organizations that are
helping to educate and train more
[SPEAKER_00]: clinicians out there to try to reach,
you know, as many people as we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have a preferred route of
administration or something that seems to
[SPEAKER_02]: work better than others or is it sort of
patient dependent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I certainly have found,
you know, certain conditions will respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to certain, you know, to different routes
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who has severe chronic pain,
inhalation tends to be the most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives them the most control over their
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there sometimes can be a lot of
education around that because they may
[SPEAKER_00]: come to me and say, you know, I'm not
going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very counterintuitive to think
that inhaling anything is going to benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: their health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, giving them some education
around that often, if they won't consider
[SPEAKER_00]: it at first, they may come back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's, you know, just like,
I'm like, how successful do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are we just going to dance
around a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to go straight to what I
think is going to help you right away?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I'll say I'd rather dance
around it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, older people definitely come to
me and they want a cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're like, I want a cream or
a balm or a salve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a topical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a tincture is often probably the
second thing that I'll recommend because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's easy for them to kind of titrate and
it feels more medicinal to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to overeat edibles, right,
because they taste good and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really understand the delayed onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even if I do educate them and
say, just take one, I can't tell you how
[SPEAKER_00]: many times I've gotten a call like,
well, that was really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how many did you take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I ate the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you, you know, and you do,
you try to tell them not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, like I said, people forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not going to over consume a
tincture because they generally don't
[SPEAKER_00]: taste that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know your presentation this year is
going to be talking about treating
[SPEAKER_02]: patients with Alzheimer's and dementia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you could speak a
little bit more to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's an area that I really have
enjoyed being a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm fortunate in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some assisted living communities
and boarding care facilities that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been early adopters and willing to
dispense, you know, cannabis to their
[SPEAKER_00]: residents because, you know, we don't have
any FDA approved pharmaceuticals for their
[SPEAKER_00]: residents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's very,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stressful for the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stressful for the staff at these
communities that are caring for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we have been trying
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started this about five years ago.
And it's very stressful for the family.
It's stressful for the staff at these
communities that are caring for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started this about five years ago and
it's just grown, you know, and now,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes when the residents,
before they even come into the facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: the family's like, call Eloise,
get on this regimen, because they see such
[SPEAKER_00]: great success in terms of managing,
you know, they're more redirectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're calmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're kind of laughing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of those benefits of that
euphoria that we can see in this
[SPEAKER_00]: population is just, it's life-changing
when it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know that prior to your
presentation at CAMHIT 2019, which you can
[SPEAKER_02]: see at camhitevents.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little plug there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had mentioned the story of Lucy at the
beginning of the presentation,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you had said that you actually,
after getting her onto cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually managed to get her dementia
diagnosis removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Her daughter did all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had it removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: How typical is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, you know, that family is an
example of a family that just was so
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When Lucy got her mind back and lost all
that weight and, you know, there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: dementia anymore and the daughter was just
a fierce advocate for her mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had Kaiser remove it from her
diagnosis, list of diagnoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very uncommon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's still with us too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I let you go, I wanted to give you
