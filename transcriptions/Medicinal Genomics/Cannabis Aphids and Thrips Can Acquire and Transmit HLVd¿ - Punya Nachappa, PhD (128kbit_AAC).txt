[SPEAKER_01]: No, and in reading through your abstract
as well, it said that you found that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis aphids and thrips can acquire and
transmit HLVD as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a bit more about the
significance of that discovery?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was, it was not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, what was surprising is what was
that in hops, they found that hops aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: did not transmit hoplite and viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was published where my,
in our world, I mean, aphids, as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see in my background, see how prolific
they are in the, on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can pretty much, and they've been
shown to transmit other viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of surprising that they,
that they didn't find it in hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we set out to test aphids and
thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we picked those are they
are the most common greenhouse pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They love the greenhouse environment
because it's hot, humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes the populations grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a year round supply of host,
host plants for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within five minutes, both insects can
acquire the viroid, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the phloem and aphids feed in the
phloem of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also in the, but thrips have much
shorter mouthparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids mouthparts are like mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the mosquitoes of the plant world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can go all the way down to the
phloem and suck up the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips are not, but they must be picking
it up from the, their cell content
[SPEAKER_00]: feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to just suck up all the cell
content, cytoplasm, nucleus, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are different mechanisms by which
they're acquiring the viroid, but both are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any insect could acquire it, but the proof
of the concept was to then test
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, we then starve the insects
to make sure all of the gut content is out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just in there transiently,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we place those insects on healthy
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, both of them can transmit
I think my other master student is
[SPEAKER_00]: retesting some things, but retesting some
assays, but it's between 10 to 25%
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sequence every single amplicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just rely on the band,
on the PCR gel band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one is sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not entirely surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one that I'm very keen to test
is spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is another huge problem,
a huge greenhouse pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also find it in outdoor hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of other insects to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other interesting aspect is last year,
we saw that hops can also infect other
[SPEAKER_00]: hosts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really important hosts, host plants
like tomatoes and chrysanthemums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to see if these vectors,
cannabis aphids or threbs can transmit it
[SPEAKER_00]: to other host plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it just takes a few minutes to
acquire and seemingly a few minutes to
[SPEAKER_00]: transmit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
Let's take a look.
Let's take a look.
