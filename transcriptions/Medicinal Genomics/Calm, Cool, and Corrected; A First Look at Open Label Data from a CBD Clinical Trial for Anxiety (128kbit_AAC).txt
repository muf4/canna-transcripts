[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first I'd like to thank the
organizers of CanMed, and thank you so
[SPEAKER_00]: much for the gracious invitation to
present this year, and I'm so sorry and so
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be with you in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd much rather be there, trust me,
perhaps next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, I'm honored to share some
data with you from basically a first look,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, at open-label data from a CBD
clinical trial for anxiety, or what I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to call high anxiety, question mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about anxiety disorders,
it's important to remember that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: the most common of all mental health
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the World Health
Organization, one in 13 globally suffers
[SPEAKER_00]: from anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders
does vary across age groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, within the United States,
it appears that between the ages of 30 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 44, we have the greatest likelihood of
having an anxiety disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, and perhaps not
surprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic has
[SPEAKER_00]: not helped the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: census data revealed 42% of people
reported symptoms of anxiety or depression
[SPEAKER_00]: in December of 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an increase of 11% from the
previous year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty big jump, a 31% increase,
so important to keep these things in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anxiety disorders are generally
underreported and undertreated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lost productivity as a result of
anxiety and depression costs the global
[SPEAKER_00]: economy somewhere in the neighborhood of
about a trillion dollars every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as if there aren't treatments
for anxiety disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of available
pharmacologic approaches, including,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not limited to, things like SSRIs,
SNRIs, benzodiazepines, MAOIs,
[SPEAKER_00]: tricyclics, 5-HT1A receptor agonists,
anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that despite a number of
options with regard to conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: medications, response rates remain
somewhat limited, and residual symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: are often present.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, adverse effects also limit
tolerability and adherence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many times we've heard
people say, yeah, I took the medication,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the side effects were so hideous,
I had to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So limited efficacy of current
pharmaceuticals and people's unwillingness
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue with something that causes
side effects underscores the need for
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative treatments for those suffering
with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing availability and popularity of
legal cannabis products, combined with
[SPEAKER_00]: higher rates of anxiety globally,
further exacerbated, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the COVID-19 pandemic, has reignited a
long-standing conversation about the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential effects of cannabis on anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to remember, though,
that when we think about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, again, as I'm very fond of reminding
people, we have one word, and we use it to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe lots of things, almost anything
at all from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about products, cannabis or
cannabinoid-based products, very important
[SPEAKER_00]: to remember that they can either be
plant-derived or non-plant-derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of plant-derived products,
you can have full-spectrum products,
[SPEAKER_00]: which contain a host of cannabinoid
constituents, delta-9-THC, CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: a host of other cannabinoids, as well as
terpenoids, the essential oils that give
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis its characteristic scent and
flavor profile, and have their own
[SPEAKER_00]: bio-behavioral effects, flavonoids,
et cetera, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are broad-spectrum products,
which contain all of the above,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for delta-9-THC, interesting and a
completely separate talk, probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of how we, quote, get to zero,
because it's an interesting approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But broad-spectrum products are designed
to capitalize on the full-spectrum aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of having everything from the plant that
may be beneficial without the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxicating issues related to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also have plant-derived isolates,
for example, things like Epidiolex,
[SPEAKER_00]: a single-extracted compound, cannabidiol,
from the plant that's purified,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it has no other cannabinoid
constituents, no terpenoids, no
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isolates can also be non-plant-derived,
so things that are more conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: medications, for example, what we would
call a synthetic cannabinoid, like
[SPEAKER_00]: nabilon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis and cannabinoids can be used for
multiple reasons, in many ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in countless combinations,
so it's important to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single compounds, like the single isolated
cannabinoid or compound that I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about, basically, works very differently
from a full-spectrum product, where you
[SPEAKER_00]: have the broad range of naturally
occurring chemicals in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: including THC, and the entourage effect or
the synergistic action that occurs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of multiple cannabinoids,
terpenoids, and flavonoids is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be leveraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many who question the presence
of things like the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's becoming more and more widely
accepted at this point, especially since
[SPEAKER_00]: lower doses of full-spectrum products may,
in fact, have therapeutic effects relative
[SPEAKER_00]: to single-extracted compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a meta-analysis in epilepsy
patients conducted in 2018 that basically
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at patients using CBD-rich
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were full-spectrum products,
and the meta-analysis basically reported
[SPEAKER_00]: that lower doses were required to retrieve
a therapeutic effect, and fewer adverse
[SPEAKER_00]: events were reported compared to those
patients who were taking purified products
[SPEAKER_00]: or single-extracted compound products,
so important to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relationship between cannabis and
anxiety is also a complicated one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been research suggesting that
cannabis use is prevalent among
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals with anxiety disorders,
and so the question becomes, what are we
[SPEAKER_00]: really looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Relaxation and relief from anxiety are
among the most commonly reported motives
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis use, and to date,
very few studies have examined the causal
[SPEAKER_00]: nature of the association, and those that
have have failed predominantly to control
[SPEAKER_00]: for what I would call related factors,
which has led to mixed findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most at this point believe that the
etiology of anxiety disorders is
[SPEAKER_00]: multifactorial and not likely caused by a
single factor, including cannabis use,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's very, very important to keep in
mind, but there are still plenty of people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are convinced that that is probably
the cause and not a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been several reviews that have
looked at the effects of cannabis on
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to 2012, there was a review
that looked and basically reported that
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes were highly variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis may have a bidirectional
influence on anxiety responses as a
[SPEAKER_00]: function of dosage, not incomprehensible,
certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A later study noted mixed findings with
the regard to impact of cannabis on
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety in recreational consumers,
and I should say right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very big part of the picture,
whether we're talking about individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: with anxiety disorders who are being
treated as those using recreationally and
[SPEAKER_00]: those using for medical purposes with
regard to how they're considered and how
[SPEAKER_00]: the approaches may vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a systematic review in 2017,
there was a report that concluded that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use is no more than a minor risk
factor for the development of elevated
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety symptoms in the general
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the National Academy of Science,
Engineering, and Medicine report in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same year reported there was limited
evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: would be effective for improving symptoms
of anxiety and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why so mixed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Individual factors, including but not
limited to things like your genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: profile, physiology, other substance use,
and previous experience with cannabis are
[SPEAKER_00]: very likely to play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: The impact of cannabis and cannabinoid
products on anxiety appears to be related
[SPEAKER_00]: to the very specific and very different
impact and effect of individual
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, research findings suggest
that delta 9 THC and cannabidiol have
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects on anxiety and that dose
is absolutely a critical consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about THC, we know that THC
can be anxiolytic at low doses,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is it can reduce symptoms of anxiety,
but is often anxiogenic at higher doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can either exacerbate or perhaps
even cause anxiety at higher doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been a number of studies
demonstrating this with regard to acute
[SPEAKER_00]: administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the earliest one that I have on
this slide goes back to 2012 where healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: males administered 10 megs of THC
exhibited increased anxiety as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: dysphoria and some psychotic symptoms,
sedation and subjective intoxication as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as increased heart rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some later studies found that daily use
was associated with anxiety disorders even
[SPEAKER_00]: after stopping the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acute subjective effects following smoking
joints that contained up to 60 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC in recreational consumers
demonstrated that THC decreased calmness,
[SPEAKER_00]: alertness and contentment and THC induced
increases in anxiety actually lasted up to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight hours after smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among cannabis users, female users report
increased anxiety symptoms relative to
[SPEAKER_00]: female healthy controls, maybe some
obvious gender differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, CBD, it appears perhaps
has anxiolytic properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been a number of studies going
back into the 80s actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our folks outside of the US have done some
really compelling work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first one looked at THC induced
anxiety and CBD was able to mitigate the
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiolytic effects produced by THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same group actually also reported that
CBD reduced anxiety induced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: simulated public speaking test in healthy
controls and in patients with social
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a more recent clinical trial,
a double blind clinical trial in Japan
[SPEAKER_00]: that looked at the efficacy of 300
milligrams of hemp derived CBD isolate,
[SPEAKER_00]: so single extracted compound in teenagers
with social anxiety disorders and avoidant
[SPEAKER_00]: personality disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD treated group exhibited
significantly decreased anxiety relative
[SPEAKER_00]: to the non-treated group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, rather compelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to dose investigations of all
you study products containing single
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted compounds, CBD only purified
CBD, which exhibits an inverted bell
[SPEAKER_00]: shaped dose response curve with limited
dosage range for therapeutic response.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that whole plant full spectrum
products have been shown to yield
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic response potentially at lower
doses relative to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likely the result of the entourage effect
or this synergistic action of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, turpinoids and the other
players.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that's been done so far has
been using single extracted compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2014, I started a program called MIND
or marijuana investigations for
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroscientific discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of observational,
longitudinal, cross-sectional survey and
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first clinical trial we launched
some years ago is a cannabis derived high
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD formulation for individuals with
moderate to severe anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of other trials ongoing
for anxiety as well, which I'll tell you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about, but this is the one I'm
going to show you some data from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically a custom formulated
study product that I sourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original story is actually much more
interesting than the final story,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the study product wound up being
formulated with a NIDA based extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've completed the open label phase of
the open label to double blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double blind is now underway and we
actually have added a third arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was an open label phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The double blind phase includes placebo,
the same product that people got in the
[SPEAKER_00]: open label phase and a single extracted
isolated version of the study product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So study product removed everything except
the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you data from the open
label phase in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a CBD related project focused
on patients with anxiety and agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically I formulated that product with
some industry partners and the open label
[SPEAKER_00]: phase of that study is underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a hemp derived high CBD
formulation for folks with anxiety who
[SPEAKER_00]: don't quite meet the same level of
severity for the very first trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, formulated in partnership with some
industry collaborators and that open label
[SPEAKER_00]: phase is underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got another IND approved for
patients with mood disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the anxiety realm,
we have a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of clinical trial product
formulation, the products are custom
[SPEAKER_00]: formulated by myself and my program in
collaboration with the NIDA drug supply
[SPEAKER_00]: program, as well as some industry partners
and chemists with what I would call
[SPEAKER_00]: significant campus experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically how you go from taking an
extract that looks like that, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: this very, very gummy, rather unfortunate
looking and smelling product that patients
[SPEAKER_00]: are definitely not going to be able to use
turnkey and turning it into something that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like that when you see the dropper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't taste too bad actually,
I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: This very first ever clinical trial of a
whole plant derived high CBD full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: product for anxiety is, like I said,
open labeled to double blind, custom
[SPEAKER_00]: formulated solution, four weeks of active
treatment and basically the study product
[SPEAKER_00]: consists of approximately 10 mgs per mil
of CBD, which doesn't sound like a crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: high dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's administered three times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has somewhere in the neighborhood
of 0.4 to 0.26 or so mgs of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a three time a day dosing, you're under
just one milligram of THC per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under one milligram of THC per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sublingual administration and
patients are taught how to do it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab and then they do it on their own at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a quick overview of the study
timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we have a screening visit where
everyone gets a full clinical and
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnostic assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They complete a series of anxiety and mood
rating scales, sleep, quality of life and
[SPEAKER_00]: other scales, a full neuropsych
assessment, obviously a urinalysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of our folks early on,
we did a blood draw for PKPD work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then assess them every week with regard
to anxiety and mood scales as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical check-ins and side effect
assessments and urine screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pandemic shifted this at the very end
of the trial, I will tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neuropsych assessment is done again at the
end of the four week clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, at the end of the five weeks,
we're able to verify how much they took
[SPEAKER_00]: and back calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every week that they come in or every
other week, sorry, in the open label phase
[SPEAKER_00]: they came in every week, we actually weigh
their bottles on the way out and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just us telling them,
take one mil three times a day and then
[SPEAKER_00]: having them report what time they took it,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually weigh the bottles out and
weigh the bottles in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assess their clinical ratings and their
cognitive performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, of course, interested in the safety
profile and potential for serious adverse
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urinalysis was completed to look for THC
positive status over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, which is another really
important and rather interesting finding
[SPEAKER_00]: from this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do in terms of anxiety
measures?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Beck Anxiety Inventory is a
self-report measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 21-item tool that can be used to
screen for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each item is rated on a scale of zero to
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a descriptive of subjective,
somatic, or panic-related symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the OASIS, which is also
self-report.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only five measures that can be used
across anxiety disorders to measure what
[SPEAKER_00]: we call functional impairment caused by
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures both frequency and intensity
of anxiety, as well as the degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: avoidance and interference with work and
social function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, there's the HAM-A or Hamilton
Anxiety Scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a clinician-administered scale,
a 14-item metric that is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: administered in the form of an interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows for information for multiple
sources to influence ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the subjective report,
we have the examiner's observation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's been shown to be one of the most,
if not the most, reliable index of
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical state with regard to anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of this particular cohort,
this was a group of 15 folks that we set
[SPEAKER_00]: out to complete open-label data or collect
open-label data from 15 folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stopped at 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we set out to collect data on 16
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recruited 15 and one was discontinued,
which I'll tell you about in one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average age was about 41, 16 years of
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see from their scores on the
OASIS, the BAI, and the HAM-A,
[SPEAKER_00]: they all had moderate levels of anxiety
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the 15 patients we enrolled,
we discontinued one for the use of another
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid product one time with their
partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was enough for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, the study drug was well tolerated
and there were no serious adverse events
[SPEAKER_00]: reported at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, and very importantly,
no patients reported intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, patients used not 3 mLs per
day, but 3.48 mLs per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daily equivalent to that is about 34.7
milligrams of CBD and just about 0.8 mgs
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's so important for us to
weigh the bottles, not just take their
[SPEAKER_00]: word that they're taking about a mL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they have a marked dropper,
but still, people tend to administer
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different levels over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of our open-label results,
when we look at the BAI, what we find is a
[SPEAKER_00]: 79.9% decrease in self-report ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a significant improvement in
ratings of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go from about a 20.3 at baseline to a
4.07 at the end of the four-week trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the OASIS, we see a 70.2% decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scores go from 11.3 approximately to
3.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the HAM-A, that's the examiner-driven
scale, they go from just under 20 or 19.8
[SPEAKER_00]: to 3.3, an 82.9% decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are rather striking decreases in
self-reported anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point, this will move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at other ratings of mood,
the Beck Depression Inventory,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, a very commonly administered
metric designed to measure self-reported
[SPEAKER_00]: measures or symptoms of depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our subjects go from a 20, approximately a
baseline, to a 4.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost a 78% decrease in
self-reported depressive symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Profile of mood state, which allows us to
look at differences over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total mood disturbance, this is your grand
total, goes from 65.8 down to a 23.9
[SPEAKER_00]: between baseline and four weeks of
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost a 64% decrease, so pretty
striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we also look at other
domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of sleep and quality of life,
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very commonly administered metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at sleep quality here,
lower numbers are better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks go from a 9.2 to a 5.8, it's 36%
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the short-form health
survey or the SF-36, the basic measure of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of life, we see some rather
compelling and striking significant
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements in areas like physical
function, energy, emotional well-being,
[SPEAKER_00]: social function, and pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, baseline to four weeks of
treatment, these are pretty striking
[SPEAKER_00]: differences over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing we didn't see, and that's
pretty interesting actually because we
[SPEAKER_00]: think of them potentially as control
areas, role limitations with regard to the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical role that someone has to perform,
and general health.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of some of the other areas where
we might expect to see some change,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those two, we don't between baseline
and four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we turn to cognitive performance,
this is very similar actually to data that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been collecting for some time in our
longitudinal observational study that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been going for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically look at people who are
interested in using medical cannabis for a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of medical or psychological or
psychiatric symptoms or conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at them before they begin using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, over time, we go all the way out
now for several years, but we published a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper looking at cognitive change over the
course of one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at baseline to three months,
six, and 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was basically some
improvement over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those folks are choosing their own
regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this is a clinical trial and
what we see is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients are basically demonstrating
stable or improved performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not demonstrating decrements,
especially in measures of frontal or
[SPEAKER_00]: executive function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of some of the
measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trail-making test part B, not
significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're certainly not getting worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: For stoop interference time or time to
complete a task requiring active
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibition over learned response tendency,
we see a statistically significant
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement with regard to time required
to get the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wisconsin card sort is considered a
gold standard measure of frontal function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total correct, what we see is a
statistically significant improvement
[SPEAKER_00]: between baseline and four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see the same thing in the number
of categories achieved on the Wisconsin
[SPEAKER_00]: card sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting worse over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important, especially when we
consider what we know to be the case in
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very often we see decrements in areas of
executive function.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some other measures of executive
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The letter number sequencing task and a
task of phonemic fluency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're seeing either stable or
improved performance patterns,
[SPEAKER_00]: not decrements here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improvements after four weeks of
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks are going from a 12.5 to a 13.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, alternate versions of tasks are
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really thinking this is a
practice effect, especially after four
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, but certainly something to watch
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the expectation perhaps when
we introduce something that's cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid based is I'm sure it's not
necessarily going to make people better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not what we're seeing in the
case of this particular clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: To conclude the CBD open label clinical
trial data, so far, findings suggest that
[SPEAKER_00]: use of this custom formulated whole plant
derived high CBD sublingual product
[SPEAKER_00]: results in less severe anxiety as measured
by the OASIS and fewer anxiety related
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms as measured by the BAI and the
HAM-A after four weeks of treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to their own baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self-reported improvements in other mood
symptoms like sleep and quality of life
[SPEAKER_00]: were also noted, which may be related to
reduced anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny these things often coexist,
so it's hard to disentangle them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have often noted that sleep disturbance
tends to happen in lots of different
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not surprising that when we see sleep
improvement, we also see other things
[SPEAKER_00]: improve and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improvements on tasks of executive
function were also noted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly didn't see any worsening of
task performance, which is really the
[SPEAKER_00]: important issue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No significant adverse events or
intoxication were reported at all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: A definitive assessment of the impact of
this novel treatment will certainly come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the double-blind placebo controlled
phase, which is, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: currently underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this additional study arm that
will now allow us to compare the full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum product to a matched CBD isolate,
which I'm very, very excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I mentioned in passing is
that we did monitor people for THC
[SPEAKER_00]: positive status over the course of the
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is that many,
many people are taking what they call,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote, CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, oh, I'm just taking CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they really mean is they're taking a
product that's either high in CBD or
[SPEAKER_00]: marketed as such or contains CBD,
primarily hemp-derived products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big question is, am I going to fail
this random drug test since I'm taking
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, which I think is a great question?
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been very few studies that have
directly assessed whether the use of a
[SPEAKER_00]: full-spectrum high CBD product could yield
positive results on the urinary drug test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assessing cannabis use through the
detection of THC metabolites, it's really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We monitored this status in this
open-label trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used in-house or in-lab drug assays,
and we then confirmed those data using
[SPEAKER_00]: GCMS quantification in pre-versus
post-treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at the relationships
between THC positive status and
[SPEAKER_00]: demographic variables, as well as things
like creatinine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creatinine is typically reflective of
kidney function and hydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: After four weeks, remember our final
sample was 14, not 15, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to get rid of one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly 50% of our subjects or our
patients, seven of them, were positive for
[SPEAKER_00]: THC metabolites after the four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: GCMS confirmed the assay findings but
indicated that the drug screen was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually more sensitive than its stated
lower limit of detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably because of some
cross-contamination from other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC status was only significantly
associated with creatinine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no association with any other
demographic variable, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: BMI.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also no association between THC
status and how much product people
[SPEAKER_00]: actually took.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, I mentioned that we do bottle
weights out and bottle weights in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the actual amount was somewhere around
35 mgs of CBD that folks were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: every day, not four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would think that people who had
more might have had a higher chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not amount of product,
it's not BMI.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not any other demographic variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only relationship we saw was with
creatinine, the measure of hydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients consistently using full-spectrum
hemp-derived products, then, may test
[SPEAKER_00]: positive for cannabis use on urinary drug
screens, which is something that people
[SPEAKER_00]: need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely need studies with larger
sample sizes to more thoroughly assess
[SPEAKER_00]: which variables, like how much product
people are using, BMI, age, sex,
[SPEAKER_00]: race, other medication use, for example,
how those things contribute to positive
[SPEAKER_00]: THC status in only some individuals,
particularly those with higher creatinine
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, and this is something I can't
stress enough, this study product,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look at the math, contained 0.02%,
let me say that again, 0.02% THC by
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that hemp-derived products can
contain up to, that's right, 0.3% THC by
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more than 10 times the amount of
THC, as in my current study product,
[SPEAKER_00]: and half of my sample was positive after
four weeks of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's often assumed that individuals who
are using hemp-derived products will be
[SPEAKER_00]: negative for THC, but this may not be
true, especially if assays are more
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive than advertised, or they're
being impacted by what I would call
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-contamination from other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those assays are designed to look at the
THC metabolites, but the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: others may, in fact, create a little bit
of a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: These findings certainly underscore the
potential for adverse consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loss of employment, for example,
legal or treatment ramifications,
[SPEAKER_00]: despite the legality of hemp-derived
products, they're legal, but that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you won't test positive for THC,
depending on what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I had a dollar for every person
that said, but I'm only using CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they hold up this bottle,
and it's not CBD, it's a broad-spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: product or a full spectrum product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen them turn positive with
broad-spectrum products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of other ongoing clinical
trials at the MIND program, some of which
[SPEAKER_00]: are pending.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have INDs received for pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just approved for anxiety in
patients with glioblastoma and in patients
[SPEAKER_00]: with bipolar disorder, which is very
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some INDs pending for indications
like sleep and so many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean when I say many more?
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of different indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the MIND program will continue to
support a range of studies that will
[SPEAKER_00]: generate ecologically valid empirically
sound data, examine the unique synergistic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of cannabis and its constituents
to determine the efficacy of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: for specific conditions and disease
states, clarify the overall impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid treatment on physical and
mental health, invest in studies designed
[SPEAKER_00]: to improve patients' overall well-being
and assess potential risk and harm,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as patterns of misuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all about just the good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have to look at the potential,
quote, bad or downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, we'd like to harness the
therapeutic potential while minimizing
[SPEAKER_00]: risk and harm of cannabinoid-based
treatment and exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to overcome barriers and conduct
empirically sound research to draw clear
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say it's not one thing or the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the good, the bad, and ultimately the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without vision, we have no ability to move
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very often we're forced to think
outside the box in order to move the field
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I would thank you for your
time and attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acknowledge my extraordinary staff,
without whom I could not...
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't do any of this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the most dedicated people ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would again wish you a wonderful
rest of your conference and be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
