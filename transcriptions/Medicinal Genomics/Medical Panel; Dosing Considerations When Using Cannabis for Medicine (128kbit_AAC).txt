[SPEAKER_04]: Hello This is the age-old question right
like how much is enough So I just want to
[SPEAKER_04]: start this conversation by saying that
we've got a panel of experts here Medical
[SPEAKER_04]: doctors clinicians that actually have a
ton of experience Dosing and so I think
[SPEAKER_04]: we're gonna have a lot of super valuable
information here and I also want to start
[SPEAKER_04]: by kind of turning the dosing model on its
head because one of the things that we've
[SPEAKER_04]: learned To do and in medical schools and
FNP schools and whatnot is pharmacological
[SPEAKER_04]: dosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to talk about pharmacological
dosing versus physiological dosing And
[SPEAKER_04]: this may be new to some of you,
but the idea of physiological dosing is
[SPEAKER_04]: using the amount The least amount to get
the effect you want now you can imagine
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly that this is labor-intensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's labor-intensive for the patient and
it's labor-intensive for the clinician
[SPEAKER_04]: because I have to follow it but it's a
good model of dosing and if we followed a
[SPEAKER_04]: model like that, we would actually have a
Medical system that didn't kill 80 to
[SPEAKER_04]: 100,000 people a year based on properly
prescribed pharmaceuticals and that is a
[SPEAKER_04]: real number by the year So what we'll do
here is let me quickly say hello to
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi You've got on the end you've got Karen
McClelland, Dr. Karen McClelland,
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got Dr. Michelle Shuffett,
and you've got Dr. Bonnie Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got Dr. Dustin Sulak And then I'm
Dr. Kevin Spelman, but not that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: doctor but another kind of doctor And what
we'll do here part one will jump into and
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry for the popping part one will
jump into some slides and then part two
[SPEAKER_04]: will actually have a robust discussion
based on what's the right amount so and
[SPEAKER_04]: Michelle I think you're up first
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank You Kevin and thank you everyone for
coming out this afternoon My name is
[SPEAKER_02]: Michelle Shuffett, and I work with
Columbia Care I'm not sure how many of you
[SPEAKER_02]: are familiar with Columbia Care,
but they're a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer They create and sell
precision formulated unit dosed medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis products, and what do I mean by
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically like a pharmaceutical
product each dose tells you exactly how
[SPEAKER_02]: many milligrams You're going to get in a
particular tablet tincture Vaporization
[SPEAKER_02]: that sort of thing and it really helps
patients because it allows them to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to titrate the products in a safe and
effective way We're licensed to operate in
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 different jurisdictions in the US and
the EU And I'm going to talk mostly about
[SPEAKER_02]: New York We are bringing precision
formulated products to California later
[SPEAKER_02]: this fall But the data that we're going to
talk about today is from our New York
[SPEAKER_02]: database so since we started in New York
we've delivered almost 12 million doses of
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis to patients And the
database we're looking at today is what we
[SPEAKER_02]: call the impact database, and I'm going to
this kind of moves around here I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk a little bit about our general
population and then also talk about a
[SPEAKER_02]: cohort of older versus younger And if you
were here before for the previous
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation I think Eloise did a fabulous
job talking about some of the special
[SPEAKER_02]: needs in the elderly population and the
reasons why medical cannabis is super
[SPEAKER_02]: important for that particular group So
let's jump right in with the general
[SPEAKER_02]: population in New York The way the rules
work in New York is you have to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: qualifying condition and then also an
associated condition or symptom And the
[SPEAKER_02]: number one condition in New York as you
might imagine is chronic pain About 50% of
[SPEAKER_02]: patients have that listed on their
certification Number two is neuropathy and
[SPEAKER_02]: number three is cancer The average age is
53.5 and we're actually pretty equally
[SPEAKER_02]: balanced with about half female,
half male Now let's look at the dosing
[SPEAKER_02]: that these patients get So to kind of set
you up from a dosing perspective we have
[SPEAKER_02]: THC on the left hand side of the slide and
we have CBD on the right hand side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: slide And the way we look at the dose is
we look at the patient's first invoice
[SPEAKER_02]: versus their most recent invoice and we
compare that over time So we have it
[SPEAKER_02]: divided up in quartile and we also have a
median and a mean value And if you start
[SPEAKER_02]: with the THC side what you'll see and I
don't think this would surprise anyone in
[SPEAKER_02]: the room is that the THC dose gradually
goes up over time between the first and
[SPEAKER_02]: most recent invoice Whereas the CBD dose
on the right hand side you'll see that
[SPEAKER_02]: that trends downward with the first versus
most recent invoice And if we look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: averages the mean THC daily dose for that
patient population is about 31 milligrams
[SPEAKER_02]: and the mean CBD dose for that population
is about 14 milligrams So now we'll switch
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'll talk about that younger versus
older cohort And again you know Eloise
[SPEAKER_02]: explained it very eloquently We know that
80% of the elderly population has multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: chronic conditions They take multiple
medications Their healthcare is extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: costly, complicated and it impacts their
quality of life And we look at medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis as a safe and effective
alternative for these patients And we
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to understand if there were any
considerations based on the information we
[SPEAKER_02]: have within that patient population So we
decided to split it up as 45 and under
[SPEAKER_02]: being younger 70 plus being older The 45
and under group was about 50% female and
[SPEAKER_02]: the top three conditions were chronic
pain, neuropathy and IBD With the older
[SPEAKER_02]: population it was a little bit more skewed
towards the female side almost 60% Top
[SPEAKER_02]: three conditions were chronic pain,
neuropathy and cancer So the difference
[SPEAKER_02]: was kind of in just number three there But
you'll notice that the 70 plus group had a
[SPEAKER_02]: higher percentage of neuropathy overall
And I think that's important when we look
[SPEAKER_02]: at the different doses So this time we're
going to have just THC on the slide We
[SPEAKER_02]: have the younger group on the left We have
the older group on the right And you see
[SPEAKER_02]: the same trend The dose goes up first
versus last versus most recent invoice And
[SPEAKER_02]: the median dose in that elderly population
is lower than the younger population 10.5
[SPEAKER_02]: versus 16.9 as you might imagine When we
dose these patients we're very careful to
[SPEAKER_02]: start the elderly population on the
smallest possible dose of THC for all the
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons that we know very well You know we
don't want to have a fall We don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: have disorientation or confusion If we
look at the CBD side again you see the
[SPEAKER_02]: same exact trend as we saw with the
general population The doses go down over
[SPEAKER_02]: time And the median dose for the elderly
7.2 and for the adult population or the
[SPEAKER_02]: younger population 4.6 milligrams And
again I think this is probably related to
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact that these patients had more
neuropathy And what we found in our
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with the patients in New York
is that the higher CBD doses work best for
[SPEAKER_02]: patients with neuropathy So what about
adverse effects and satisfaction with
[SPEAKER_02]: therapy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I jump into that I want you to
understand a little bit more about our
[SPEAKER_02]: different product formulations They're set
up into basically three categories in the
[SPEAKER_02]: formulated products We have Theracid which
is a high THC product, Elacid which is
[SPEAKER_02]: equal, and Claracid which is a higher CBD
product And the ratios are 20 to 1 in
[SPEAKER_02]: either direction or 1 to 1 for the middle
group And if you look at the elderly
[SPEAKER_02]: population they took about the same of
each of those three types of products
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a little bit more Theracid but not
too much It was a couple percentage points
[SPEAKER_02]: higher Whereas the younger population took
almost twice as much Theracid as they did
[SPEAKER_02]: the other two formulated products But the
thing that we found most interesting and
[SPEAKER_02]: we were most excited to see is that the
satisfaction with therapy was exactly the
[SPEAKER_02]: same across both groups They were taking
the medication in a dose that was
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate and they felt like they were
getting relief from their symptomatology
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also safe with the most common
adverse event being increased appetite and
[SPEAKER_02]: that was seen in 25% of patients
regardless of whether they were elderly or
[SPEAKER_02]: on the younger side And I think the most
important point on this slide is only 6%
[SPEAKER_02]: of the patients that were 70 plus reported
any confusion or disorientation So to
[SPEAKER_02]: recap, the most common qualifying
conditions, chronic pain, neuropathy,
[SPEAKER_02]: and cancer And in our general population
we see that trend up in THC, a trend down
[SPEAKER_02]: in CBD over time And we implore what I
call a functional dosing strategy which I
[SPEAKER_02]: think is what you were getting at earlier
where we always start patients on the
[SPEAKER_02]: lowest possible dose and titrate them up
slowly And the idea is to, as you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: find the smallest amount that works
without impairing them in any form or
[SPEAKER_02]: fashion These products are safe and
effective in the elderly population and we
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that the higher CBD is due to the
fact that the elderly population tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: have more neuropathy from a qualifying
condition perspective Last but not least,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really exciting to have some actual
data to back up the idea that medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis could be a safe and effective
alternative for these patients and it
[SPEAKER_02]: might even move into a first line position
and replace over-the-counter medications
[SPEAKER_02]: because it quite frankly has a better
safety profile than most of those
[SPEAKER_02]: over-the-counter medications and other
medications that the elderly population
[SPEAKER_02]: have to take Thank you
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent presentation and real data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Michelle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Sulek?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people were not in this room
yesterday?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so maybe about half.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a little review from some
slides that we had yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: The essentials of what I think are
important about cannabis dosing that make
[SPEAKER_05]: it different from other medications.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll just dive right in.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, cannabis has an
extraordinarily broad safe and effective
[SPEAKER_05]: dosing range.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't see many medications where you
can have a 500 or a 5,000-fold safe and
[SPEAKER_05]: effective dosing range.
[SPEAKER_05]: But literally, these are the doses,
including the outliers that I've seen
[SPEAKER_05]: effective in my practice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means someone my size might need
one milligram of cannabinoids per day to
[SPEAKER_05]: help a condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they might do well with 3,500
milligrams per day, or maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen people at 3,500 with no side
effects, feeling great, no psychoactivity,
[SPEAKER_05]: no impairment, even if it's almost all
THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet researchers have really tried to kill
animals with THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even at doses several orders of
magnitude higher than what I'm seeing in
[SPEAKER_05]: my practice, they've failed to do so.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really impressive how safe this
medicine is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So really broad dosing range.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then within this broad dosing range,
there are nonlinear dose response effects
[SPEAKER_05]: and different phases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an example of a biphasic dose
response, where in the first phase,
[SPEAKER_05]: as you increase the dose, the effect gets
stronger.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the second phase, as you increase
the dose, the effect gets weaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is mostly due to tolerance building.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you'll notice that there's an optimal
dose there in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: The optimal dose is unique for each
person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it can change at different stages of
their life and different stages of their
[SPEAKER_05]: healing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be a bit of a moving target.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when someone's at the optimal dose,
they do not build tolerance.
[SPEAKER_05]: They retain efficacy and can do so for
years or even decades with great results.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this shows up in the animal
literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an example of locomotor activity
in rats.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dark bar is their baseline locomotor
activity level.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you give them a tiny dose of THC,
the activity goes down.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you increase the dose, the activity
goes up.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you increase the dose even more,
the activity goes back down again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see the emergence of something
called catalepsy after that peak dose
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Catalepsy means remaining still in an
unusual position.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's analogous to what we call couch lock
in people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the goal here was to reduce
activity, maybe a similar goal to reducing
[SPEAKER_05]: spasticity or anxiety or something like
that, then you can see we would actually
[SPEAKER_05]: do better using that very tiny dose,
0.2 milligrams per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Compared to the higher dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: So less can be more with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It very often is, but not always.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another example of less is more.
[SPEAKER_05]: People with cancer, chronic pain,
treated with opioids, started off on
[SPEAKER_05]: Nabiximals, which is a one-to-one oral
spray of CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see the group that got 20
milligrams per day did better than the
[SPEAKER_05]: group that got 50 and 83 milligrams per
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll hold back on the placebo
conversation because we're short on time,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And CBD also has biphasic dose response
effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people don't observe this
clinically because their patients can't
[SPEAKER_05]: afford the high doses that are often
required to demonstrate this effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's one example of a study on
anxiety that showed that 300 milligrams
[SPEAKER_05]: work better than 900 milligrams and better
than 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a sweet spot with these
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think as we design and perform
clinical trials, this has to be taken into
[SPEAKER_05]: account, that it's not a one-size-fits-all
dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need pragmatic dosing approaches.
[SPEAKER_05]: I already told you guys this morning about
how tiny, tiny bits of THC can do things
[SPEAKER_05]: in mice that are quite surprising.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's just the other two references that
I mentioned this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Protect the brain, protect the heart,
protect the liver.
[SPEAKER_05]: And CBD-A, microgram anti-emetic activity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get a chance to mention this this
morning, but you'll notice the scale on
[SPEAKER_05]: the x-axis is micrograms per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Half a microgram per kilogram of CBD-A.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a rat, I believe, was enough to reduce
nausea.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is such a small dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even for a rat, that's an incredibly small
dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD-A seems to be ultra potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably don't need a lot of it to go
a long way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it mimics many of CBD's actions,
except it does not down-regulate the CB1
[SPEAKER_05]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So unlike CBD, which is a negative
allosteric modulator at that receptor and
[SPEAKER_05]: can counteract some of the effects of THC,
CBD-A would act a lot more like CBD,
[SPEAKER_05]: but without that anti-THC aspect,
which for some patients, they want the THC
[SPEAKER_05]: and the CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for some people, they want the full
strength of THC to shine through and not
[SPEAKER_05]: be limited by the CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet they want to get the other benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD-A is a great candidate for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: With THC, interestingly, when I started my
practice, there was no CBD around.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were treating everyone with THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know how potent their formulas
were.
[SPEAKER_05]: That didn't stop us from getting great
results.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned that there's almost always a
therapeutic window with THC, which means,
[SPEAKER_05]: say, this is the dose needed to treat
pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the dose that gets people too
stoned to be comfortable and functional.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can get inside that window with
precision dosing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's some strategies for widening
that therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, just starting low and going slow
widens the therapeutic window,
[SPEAKER_05]: as you can see on the slide, because of
heterogeneous tolerance building in
[SPEAKER_05]: different brain regions to the effects of
THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it so that we're more likely to
retain efficacy of the symptom relief or
[SPEAKER_05]: therapeutic qualities while we build
tolerance to the side effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that informs dosing strategies that I
have online at healer.com, which you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: can check out.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also many bidirectional effects in
cannabis, meaning it can do one thing or
[SPEAKER_05]: it can do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think THC overdose is the best example
of that, which is characterized by nausea,
[SPEAKER_05]: vomiting, diarrhea, twitching,
muscle spasms, pain, confusion,
[SPEAKER_05]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the right dose of THC, it can treat all
of those things at the wrong dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can cause all of those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just need to say one last thing here
about dosing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of my great respect to Caroline
McCallum and her co-author, Ethan Russo,
[SPEAKER_05]: who wrote a great paper on dosing in which
they warmly acknowledged me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's just a saying in that paper
that I think the wording needs a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit of tweaking, if I may.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been quoted in other research
I've seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's start low, go slow, and stay low.
[SPEAKER_05]: When actually the real saying is,
in my opinion from what I learned and in
[SPEAKER_05]: my practice, is start low, go slow,
and don't be afraid to go all the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really what it comes down to
because some people do well on
[SPEAKER_05]: extraordinarily high doses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know that until we try,
but don't stay low.
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone's not responding to a low dose,
please titrate up to thousands of
[SPEAKER_05]: milligrams if they need it and if they can
afford it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes that works as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So two really prominent things come out of
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one is the idea of hormesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Sulak called it biphasic, also known
as hormetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these hormetic effects are classic
throughout all the biological kingdom with
[SPEAKER_04]: almost every substance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep in mind if you're a clinician and
you don't know about biphasic dosing or
[SPEAKER_04]: hormesis, look it up because it's really
rather profound.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that comes out,
and by the way, until about 1940,
[SPEAKER_04]: when the homeopaths jumped on the idea of
hormesis, which is this idea that a low
[SPEAKER_04]: dose could have an effect, but a high dose
could be toxic, there were multiple
[SPEAKER_04]: journals with the theme of hormesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the homeopaths jumped on board to
that to try to explain scientifically why
[SPEAKER_04]: their stuff worked, all the journals went
out of business within about three or four
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's science being killed by politics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the other thing that Dr. Sulak brought
up rather well is interindividual
[SPEAKER_04]: variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think most of us know in this room
at this point that the degree of
[SPEAKER_04]: interindividual variability in the
endocannabinoid system is really rather
[SPEAKER_04]: profound.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's keep that in mind and let's hand
it over to Dr. McCollum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so great to be here and we're having
such a lovely discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's going to be some overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to mention before I get going,
I've got my Twitter handle on the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of us in the audience
that are quite active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bonnie's got a great Instagram page
and trying to get others involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dustin's and Tom Folland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to really get the conversation
going and the movement that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: have about having good evidence out there
and talking rationally about this
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a couple of disclosures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with a number of different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are cannabis related groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are non-profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to mention those disclosures
before I get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Russo and myself, we wrote this
paper, as Dustin kindly pointed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to have a chat about that in
the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that's a really great
point, what you've mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might need some qualifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just enough to say that we really do
need to have good clinical practice when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're working with cannabis and be
discerning that it isn't for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure that we're
screening our patients appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're talking about dosing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just have to mention these things
before I dive into the dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are questions that I frequently ask
myself before I authorize cannabis for a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there supporting evidence for this
patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there isn't, let's have a
conversation about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's weigh the pros and cons with this
medication, just like every other
[SPEAKER_00]: medication we do in medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has this patient tried other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of worth documenting if they
have, especially for medical legal
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to write this down if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are the patient's
expectations?
[SPEAKER_00]: And talking about placebo effect and other
topics of this nature I think are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this patient have any reasons why we
wouldn't use cannabis, being very mindful
[SPEAKER_00]: of schizophrenia and other conditions we
need to be careful with THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean we can't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having a discussion around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are the patient's risks for
cannabis use disorder?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the benefits versus the risks,
like I mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we actually dose cannabis,
which is what we're going to dive into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also considering when we can taper
other medications once we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: symptom improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's available for free for download.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to touch a little bit on roots
administration because when we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about a dose and we're talking about
milligrams, that's really an edible that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're frequently referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you're inhaling cannabis,
the dose can be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the interest of time, I won't go
through all of these different roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just enough to say there are pros and
cons to different roots we will use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an acute symptom, we're going to
want to inhale cannabis probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a chronic symptom, oils can be
more helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being mindful of vaporization,
and Dustin speaks a lot to this point as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first talking about how we can use
cannabis in an inhaled format using the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest dose possible to get benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, possibly increasing the dose
until we see that response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, starting with one inhalation and
waiting 10 minutes and checking out how
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel and what symptoms are going on
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then increasing from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you add up all those
inhalations, that may become your baseline
[SPEAKER_00]: dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that dose can change for
different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a 20% THC product,
that's going to have a different number of
[SPEAKER_00]: inhalations than a 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keeping that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you go on vacation and stop
using cannabis and restart, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: with THC, you may need to go back down to
a lower previous dose just in case you've
[SPEAKER_00]: lost some of your tolerance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, really just being
mindful of how you use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially with the vaporizer,
I find it easier for patients to put a
[SPEAKER_00]: small amount in and to add more if they
need it, versus rolling a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frequently, people will smoke the whole
joint when they may not really need it
[SPEAKER_00]: all, depending on their dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to mention the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Russo is very big into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to be mindful that CBD,
in addition to THC, can allow us to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: a higher dose of THC than might have been
previously tolerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some doses that I just
mentioned that I'm drawing from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper, again, starting with about 5
milligrams to 10 milligrams twice a day
[SPEAKER_00]: for CBD, I find that to be effective for
my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have actually very few patients that do
go a whole lot higher than 50 to 100
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't see as much oncology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some other subcategories,
such as seizures and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: that may require higher doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think that it's really
interesting, this biphasic discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really don't know each individual
how they will respond and what dose would
[SPEAKER_00]: be helpful for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the higher you go, the more
costly this medication can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having a patient record their outcomes
is really helpful because they may hit a
[SPEAKER_00]: point where they're spending more money
and they're getting no more benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really getting them to check in on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for THC, I usually start around 1
milligram to 2.5 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always start at bedtime if they have any
issues with sleep, especially because then
[SPEAKER_00]: we can use it as a two-for-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a number of patients that I
actually help them sleep, and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: daytime they don't need any cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is a really
opportune window to use THC because if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're driving a car or they've got kids
and they don't want to be under the
[SPEAKER_00]: influence of THC, even a low dose,
it would be great if we didn't have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, optimizing for THC, CBDA,
and other cannabinoids I think could be
[SPEAKER_00]: very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just some general dosing tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are kind of a little bit more
specific and maybe a bit more advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the times these are points
that I go over with different individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what their experience of
cannabis has already been.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, patients get tolerance to
the side effects of cannabis, and in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience they don't necessarily get
tolerance to the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by that is I know that we
just heard from the first talk that the
[SPEAKER_00]: dose was increasing over time with THC,
but most of my patients actually plateau
[SPEAKER_00]: out at a certain dose, and they're not
increasing indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something they do report is having to
rotate a strain so they may feel like it
[SPEAKER_00]: may not be working quite as well,
but if they try a different flower that
[SPEAKER_00]: may have a similar concentration or
percentage that they do find it can help
[SPEAKER_00]: them kind of bridge that gap so that they
aren't increasing the dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this requires a lot of
education and making sure the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't just on their own increasing up to
five grams a day or 10 grams a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I have seen that in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from our studies, especially Dr. Ware,
who's one of our Canadian experts,
[SPEAKER_00]: one to three grams a day of dried product
is largely what the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patients were using in his study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over 90% of patients will only use
between 0.5 and 1.5 grams for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, so keeping that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also important to mention there's
terpenes and other minor cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_00]: can definitely make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some patients try 20 different
plants, and it may be the 18th or the 20th
[SPEAKER_00]: that do help them with different symptoms,
so those patients are quite persistent and
[SPEAKER_00]: adamant, but at some point, we do just
need to make sure that they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the outcomes that they're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever recommend shatter or dabs for
medical purposes, and even for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational purposes, I think we need to
be very mindful, especially with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the health concerns that are coming out,
and especially with unregulated products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being mindful also of tolerance,
there is an opportunity to consider a
[SPEAKER_00]: washout for some patients, and that may be
appropriate, and CBD can help us wash out
[SPEAKER_00]: a patient when they are getting up to a
higher dose of THC where they may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also mentioning there are some of
these low-risk use guidelines that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: are notable, and a lot of them make a lot
of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting low, avoiding high percentages if
we don't need it, which I don't totally
[SPEAKER_00]: agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's some math here that
they're not understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just use less of a more concentrated
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean you can't use a higher
percentage product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being careful of age of onset and
frequency of use if not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then monitoring, important just to say
that it does need to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important, if possible, to capture
questionnaire data, so anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: depression, pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to get questionnaire data
from your patients, it can be very useful,
[SPEAKER_00]: both for you and for them, but really
focusing on their function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they able to walk to the mailbox?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they able to hold their child?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the numbers don't change,
but they are living better, and they do
[SPEAKER_00]: feel that the quality of life has
improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely think that that's
important to note.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some apps out there that can
be really helpful with this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my last minute, there are some
dosing strategies that just to summarize
[SPEAKER_00]: here on this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes using oil over vaporization
can be more helpful for chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, considering CBD over THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really doing a good job on education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switching from smoking to vaporization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using, I have here, using the lowest dose
of THC, but that is working for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not focusing on percentages and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last two slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my overall, I guess,
my approach to how I treat a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question I ask, is it daytime or
nighttime symptom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I treat the day if I can really
get away with nighttime only?
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes that would mean obviously THC
at night, CBD for the daytime a lot of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially for my patients who are driving
and working.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't necessarily always feel
comfortable using THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an acute symptom or a chronic
symptom if it's acute?
[SPEAKER_00]: Vaporization, as I've mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pathophysiology, if it's largely
inflammation, CBD may be a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: option for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of exceptions to the
neurological point that I've made here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have psychosis, for example,
or in pediatrics, I may just be more
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful of using THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: For neurological condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I definitely do use THC in these
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trying to optimize CBD potentially
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then special populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the elderly, I have patients with
Parkinson's that have blood pressures,
[SPEAKER_00]: resting blood pressures of 70 over 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can be very sensitive to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I frequently start lower with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last piece here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to do any drug other
prescription changes when I initiate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's just too many things going
on and it's hard to tease out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: side effect could be due to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to help them feel better first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pull away from their prescription
medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Straight out of the doctor's mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I want to put forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people are here from industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's, and many of you may be aware of
this already.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are people out there suggesting
that the dosing is on CBD products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, well let me just talk about a
recent review that just came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: A 2019 review came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It basically said anything under about 100
milligrams of CBD a day wasn't really
[SPEAKER_04]: doing much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those of you from industry obviously,
we're seeing doses like five milligrams,
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 milligrams a couple times a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you've got people on the science
side saying it's placebo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I would say is possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, you need mystique to have placebo.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need reputation to have placebo.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got both of those, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you need price, value to have placebo.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got all three of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely there is probably some
placebo going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I may get some tomatoes thrown at me,
but there's almost certainly some placebo
[SPEAKER_04]: going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're taking something that's got
such a reputation around it and it was
[SPEAKER_04]: expensive, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's mystical because it comes from
this forbidden plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely going to be that
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, having said that, you've just
heard from a couple of docs here that say
[SPEAKER_04]: that five milligrams, 10 milligrams,
the average mean dose of 14 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, of CBD actually does something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to just throw it out to our
panel here to comment on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mostly work with children,
but I've also worked with adults now for
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I find is that there is no
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be as low as four milligrams or as
high as 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just share with you two clinical
experiences I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: One little boy was taking four milligrams
when they came to see me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parents had already started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they told me it was four
milligrams, I kind of looked askew.
[SPEAKER_01]: This little boy with autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the teacher who did not know he was on
that four milligrams before he came in
[SPEAKER_01]: actually pulled the mother aside and
commented, what are you giving your child?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he's a completely different child.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they came to see me, I thought
four milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give anybody four milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a low dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually I'm taking care of very ill
people who need much higher doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, well, why don't we just
titrate up and see if there's any more
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were already seeing more
benefits at four.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not tolerate seven milligrams or 10
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually gave him an opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for that particular child, it was very
effective at a very small dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't cost them a fortune.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's terrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's placebo because that
little boy did not know what he was
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, I had another little
boy that came in with severe aggression,
[SPEAKER_01]: self-injurious behavior, biting the
parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dad showed me pictures of all the
bruises on everybody's bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this little boy, they had started off
giving him prior to coming to see me
[SPEAKER_01]: because they had been waiting a little
while for the appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they went up to about 100 milligrams,
didn't see anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they gave THCA, ran it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't see anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave him THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told this story yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave him up to 15 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had heard that was a high dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they didn't want to give any more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it didn't do anything for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, the dad thought the bottle
was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he took 15 milligrams and slept for two
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out that this little boy
needed 400 milligrams twice a day of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to help his autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his aggression was gone at 400
milligrams twice a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But notice that here I have two kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four milligrams, 400 milligrams,
the same check box for diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's just a very wide range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I tell families is if you don't
see anything, as long as it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: negative, if you see no change,
you haven't found the dose yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to escalate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people don't want to do that
on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do highly recommend that all
children are medically supervised during
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you see a negative effect,
then obviously you maybe have gone too
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that is not the right chemo bar,
the right product, the right strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe try something else within that
realm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have a really excellent example
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually I've heard a couple.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was a great example of
physiological dosing.
Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Finding that dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine if we did that with all the drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else comment on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Michelle?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Schubert, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: To add to that point about the dosing
being incredibly personal, one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: other things we found in our database is
that we have a group of patients that have
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely high daily dose requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another group that is extremely low.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the same qualifying conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have, based on the surveys we
give them, the same satisfaction with
[SPEAKER_02]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things we're doing right now
is trying to understand the metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: pathways and the metabolism associated
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: To see if there's certain isoforms in the
Zip450 system and all those other
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacologic pathways that might give us
a little anxiety from education a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to try to understand if that
metabolism is significantly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can we use that information to predict
that starting dose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we can, then we can save these
patients money in the long run by being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to start them on the right dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or at least closer to that right dose from
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one last thing to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Israel, they're doing some clinical
trials on children with autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also measuring anandamide levels,
endocannabinoid levels in these children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a correlation that the more
deficient it seemed to correlate with more
[SPEAKER_01]: severe symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The more anandamide deficient you are,
the more excitotoxicity you may have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or neuroexcitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody is highly in that category,
let's say having severe symptoms,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's quite possible they're more
endocannabinoid deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why having objective lab testing,
either receptor status, anandamide levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be extremely helpful to be able
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is is that if you wanted to
do, right now I don't believe really
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially, the tests are available
commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I expect that, I don't know if in the
future insurance would cover those tests
[SPEAKER_01]: and then to add that cost on top of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that we might get to a
point where if we could measure this in
[SPEAKER_01]: patients and we have an indication that
maybe we could potentially get insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: to cover an anandamide deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always tell people if you're freaked
out by THC, change the name to anandamide
[SPEAKER_01]: replacement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's take a step back and talk about
plant medicines for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because plant medicines are complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, what we're doing, whether it's
cannabis or other medicinal plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: is we're using the most complex
pharmacology there is on the planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it's also evolutionarily proven.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we've always known.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't until I heard a number today,
1897, that there were isolates out there
[SPEAKER_04]: that people could take as drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now with that in mind, isolates have this
idea of one drug, one disease,
[SPEAKER_04]: or a single target.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's this idea in pharma about
dirty drugs, that a drug that hits more
[SPEAKER_04]: than one target is a dirty drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that tells you everything about the
pharma mentality.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the way medicinal plants work is by
biochemical convergence, multiple targets
[SPEAKER_04]: hitting different sites, or one compound
hitting multiple targets hitting one site.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got both of those things going
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have this biochemical convergence
on an outcome, not necessarily just one
[SPEAKER_04]: receptor, one enzyme.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've also got pharmacokinetic
potentiation from the other compounds in
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now a lot of the isolate research,
a lot of the research on CBD, and some of
[SPEAKER_04]: it on THC, has really been based on
isolates.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the reasons we may be seeing
differences in the dosing with THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD, real world clinic versus research,
is based on this idea of network
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were treating the body as a network
and massaging multiple nodes at once,
[SPEAKER_04]: rather than one single target.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that in mind, let me throw a
question out to our panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that question would be, in terms of
quality control of product and things that
[SPEAKER_04]: are full spectrum, broad spectrum,
complete spectrum, and I've heard isolate
[SPEAKER_04]: called full spectrum before, how do you
guys as clinicians negotiate the different
[SPEAKER_04]: products and the variability in those
products and dose?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I think one thing that Dr. McCallum
pointed out, which I've seen over and over
[SPEAKER_05]: again through the years, and I'm sure Dr.
Goldstein has also, is that people do well
[SPEAKER_05]: with variability in their medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: So while the pharmaceutical industry and
the medical system likes to really
[SPEAKER_05]: standardize things and keep them
consistent from one month to the next,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's an advantage in cannabis
to having it actually change over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one comment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just something I want to repeat that I
learned from you, Kevin, is the term full
[SPEAKER_05]: spectrum, I believe, refers to taking the
flower and putting it in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that there's any other
full spectrum that exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have very close to full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for the applause.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some of you recognize this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're, as an industry, doing our best to
make very broad spectrum medications.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us recognize that as many of
those compounds as we can get in there,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's going to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's not call it full spectrum
because that's a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the big problems with the
opioid epidemic was this dishonesty about
[SPEAKER_05]: what it could do and how safe it was and
what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not even tiptoe near that with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be extremely honest and transparent
if we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean another good analogy to that
concept and those thoughts on broad
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum or full spectrum, whatever you'd
like to use, is looking at nabolone,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have patients that can't afford
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes what I do is use nabolone as
the THC kind of substitute, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's not, for sleep,
at bedtime perhaps, and then CBD in the
[SPEAKER_00]: daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a number of them, it may not
work, or they have very severe side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some, it may last 10 hours or
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The side effects, which isn't great for a
number of my patients, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're elderly, and the lowest dose is
0.25 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when we try cannabis and we do a
lower dose, they get response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think looking at just THC versus THC
and the company it keeps, that's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: example of showing that there is something
more to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also something that I know,
Dustin, you've spoken about this before,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the idea that you may not always need
this medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can think of one of my professional
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's done everything I've ever told her
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's taken us a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, she doesn't use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was very sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did everything before cannabis because
she wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's got kids and very kind of fixed
in the way she was thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually did make a lot of gains
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately for her, she had to use
more THC than she wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wanted to just do CBD and just do
nabolone before that and very much
[SPEAKER_00]: regimented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when she started doing
mindfulness courses, learning about
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition, doing some yoga, so really this
neuroplasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was able to come to classes with
the help of the medicine because before
[SPEAKER_00]: she was bedridden with her chronic fatigue
and her fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually got her to a place where
she could do the hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually now she uses very little,
if any, like maybe just as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think that those are great
examples of how it can be really an
[SPEAKER_00]: adjunct and something like your tonic,
that analogy used today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to point out something.
[SPEAKER_04]: This idea of plasticity I think is really
key.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we talk about neuroplasticity a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd like to suggest that there's
actually a pharmacological or a
[SPEAKER_04]: physiological plasticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that would be based on tweaking a lot
of different sites, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of different targets, as we say in
pharma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just taking one isolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So could it be that in fact five million
years of evolution, right, in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: putting complex plants in our mouth and
chewing them, could that be that that is
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe the key way to stimulate the system
towards a healing response rather than one
[SPEAKER_04]: isolate?
[SPEAKER_04]: An isolate gives us the illusion of
control.
[SPEAKER_04]: But due to inner individual variability,
I'm going to say to you guys, with 80 to
[SPEAKER_04]: 100,000 people dying from properly
prescribed medications every year to new
[SPEAKER_04]: to nature drugs, I don't think we have
control.
[SPEAKER_04]: So great comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so another huge one that I'm finding.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, my partner and I, it's
interesting to watch the difference
[SPEAKER_04]: between us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you speak to gender differences in
terms of dosing and effects?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of inter-individual
variability.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's a big confounder on gender
differences because it's hard to tease
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just every person is so different.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the only clear gender difference that
I've observed in my practice has to do
[SPEAKER_05]: with older women who are using opioids and
have been on them for a long period of
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they seem less likely to experience
the THC-based opioid potentiation of
[SPEAKER_05]: analgesia.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like most patients that are on opioids,
we give them some THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once they get up to this dose,
the opioids feel too strong and they start
[SPEAKER_05]: breaking them in half.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's many, many of the patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have had several older women
patients on opioids that have not had that
[SPEAKER_05]: response.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even some that aren't on opioids where
THC just doesn't seem to work as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: an analgesic, where that therapeutic
window that I described before does not
[SPEAKER_05]: exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they start getting intolerable
psychoactive effects before they
[SPEAKER_05]: experience the analgesia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's far from all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a little bit of a trend I've
observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got a husband and wife couple
similar in age, mid-40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he can't tolerate any THC whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses it for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his wife has migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she can tolerate a good dose of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, one thing she mentioned to
me, she's very much into practicing yoga.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, well, I drink a full liter of
lemon water before I start my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Ethan, I know, writes quite a bit
about lemon and these antidotes and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially being able to tame THC and the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really know if that has to do
with her ability to tolerate THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he can't tolerate any.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just feel like it's all over the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonnie, Michelle, any?
[SPEAKER_03]: No?
[SPEAKER_03]: No commentary?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will just comment that some of the
data which you showed yesterday,
[SPEAKER_05]: Bonnie, out of Israel did show a sex
difference response in autistic children
[SPEAKER_05]: with autistic spectrum disorder in Israel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the boys were more likely to respond
to a CBD dominant preparation for severe
[SPEAKER_05]: behaviors in autism.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though the girls did respond,
the boys responded better.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so another topic to touch on is this
idea of microdosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've heard people say they can't stand
the idea of this term being used.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're talking about microdosing with
psilocybin now, with DMT, with THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: with CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in fact, you've seen some data here
today that microdosing, if that's what you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to call it, with CBD or THCA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you show the THCA data?
I didn't, but it's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That this makes a huge difference in
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to throw the microdosing
concept out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we don't have to be real strict
with our terminology, but it is a bit of a
[SPEAKER_05]: misnomer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think traditionally, microdosing refers
to microgram doses of a substance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're using it micro, like there's
some normal dosing, and now we're like one
[SPEAKER_05]: level below that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But essentially, I think the way it's
being used the most, and it's effectively
[SPEAKER_05]: used, is to describe typically a dose of
THC that does not produce psychoactive
[SPEAKER_05]: effects, but still promotes some type of a
health benefit, whether that's symptom
[SPEAKER_05]: relief or stress resilience improvement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the microdose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we use cannabis in a way that makes us
slightly more flexible, maybe a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: happier or easier to kind of roll with the
punches kind of thing, without getting
[SPEAKER_05]: high?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while it's doing that, what else is it
doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I mentioned this morning,
protecting us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we have a heart attack,
a brain injury?
[SPEAKER_05]: Liver injury, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe there's something to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to make a comment about
kind of the world we live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I notice a lot of the moms that come in
with their children eventually kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out for help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the child's doing better,
and now I'm a mess, so can you help me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of them will say, I've heard
about microdosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do microdosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I say is, okay, throw that term
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a term that you're trying to
kind of, you know, I showed a poster of
[SPEAKER_01]: the reefer madness, and it said she was a
good girl until she started using reefer
[SPEAKER_01]: or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's get over it, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: If THC is your medicine, it's your
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's one milligram or 100
milligrams, it's your medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we should treat each other as
adults in the room, and if two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams is your dose, you may be
saying, oh, I microdosed because you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be seen as a stoner, pothead,
whatever, but you know that that dose
[SPEAKER_01]: helps you, and hope, again, treating each
other as adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are under the influence,
maybe don't drive your car, don't take the
[SPEAKER_01]: kids to school when you're under the
influence, or, you know, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: situation you're in, that might be risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I don't think that
we, in 2019, should be calling something
[SPEAKER_01]: microdosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's actually a dose, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Shelfett, you showed some data showing
that elderly people needed a different
[SPEAKER_04]: dose than the young.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you comment on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I didn't mean to surprise you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just waiting for the specifics of
the comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the primary reason why there's
a bit of a difference in general is we
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to approach the elderly patient in a
more conservative fashion, and we do start
[SPEAKER_02]: on a lower dose from the beginning because
we don't want them to have a bad
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to some of the questions you were
talking about that you've asked patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: we try to understand before we prescribe a
medication in the pharmacy if the patient
[SPEAKER_02]: has ever tried cannabis before,
what exact symptoms or conditions they're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to deal with, and also what their
expectations are and what their
[SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if someone has never used cannabis
50 years ago recreationally, and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: no idea what THC feels like, you don't
want to give them a higher dose at the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning and have them have a bad
experience and then have them not want to
[SPEAKER_02]: even try it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we know it might help them,
so we always try to start lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's probably a functional
reason for why there's differences there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then ultimately, I think you could
look at just simply metabolism in a
[SPEAKER_02]: younger person versus an older person.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a reason why the dosing might end up
being different in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to add one more comment that
came to mind as well is my patients really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to please me, even though I tell
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, please just tell me what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they tell me that they're ordering
what I've recommended, but a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: what I've come to realize, especially on
Twitter, I've been asking some polls of
[SPEAKER_00]: people like, you know, how do you use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I chose a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, how much more would you use
if you had no barriers and if money wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: an issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized like more than 50% needed
50% more than what they were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also want to mention that the doses
we were talking about here, unless it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trial or an observational study
where it's been given like what they need
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, if they're allowed to go
higher, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're really hoarding and
stretching their supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to ask you if that data was from
New York exclusively, and so I know the
[SPEAKER_05]: economics of medical cannabis in New York
are somewhat restrictive for patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any idea if your customers are
shopping outside of your stores for CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: For just like a full CBD?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like are they using hemp CBD to cut their
total cost down?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really ask about that in our
surveys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have a factual data set that
would tell us that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think a lot of people are starting
to add that in to kind of give a boost
[SPEAKER_02]: from the perspective of the total
cannabinoid dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't have anything specific there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of us were surprised at just
how low the milligrams of CBD were.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that those are, that's an ineffective
dose, but I would think the median might
[SPEAKER_05]: be a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps the whole idea of the plant
because it is more than CBD in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other minor cannabinoids in the
products that we provide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't necessarily spell out the exact
milligrams of those, but there are 10
[SPEAKER_02]: different minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the product formulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you will permit the word microdosing,
what I would say is if you're taking a
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp product that is not THC free,
you are microdosing THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's definitely probably an
effect from the CBD as well as the THC
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even Epidiolex, the FDA approved CBD
does have some THC in it at about half a
[SPEAKER_05]: milligram per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Dr. McCallum brought up a really good
point, and that is honestly between a
[SPEAKER_04]: clinician and a patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was doing clinical work,
I used to use a psychological trick with
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds horrible, psychological trick.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things that I used to do is
if I asked them to take something twice a
[SPEAKER_04]: day, a medicinal plant preparation twice a
day, I would say to them on the follow-up,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, so how's it going with your
herbs?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'd say fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'd say, so are you getting that
once a day?
[SPEAKER_04]: And because I had told them to take it
twice a day, I'd just given them
[SPEAKER_04]: permission to tell me the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them looked at me like,
no, you said to take it twice a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm getting it sometimes twice a
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could actually really crack that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could get the truth from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that can actually be really super
helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're coming to a close here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got about five minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to give each of you the
opportunity to, I guess you've got one
[SPEAKER_04]: minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each of you the opportunity to put your
take on dosing in a couple sentences.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Caroline pointed it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just emphasize that self-awareness
is part of cannabis dosing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really important to check in and see
how you responded to that dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Write it down and then figure that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is embedded into all my free patient
education dosing programs on Healer.com,
[SPEAKER_05]: something called the Inner Inventory.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we have 30 seconds left.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll tell you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might not have time to check it right
now or maybe so.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take a deep breath.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see how smooth and easy it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You rate that on a scale from 1 to 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 is super smooth and easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: 1 is tight, hard to breathe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you take a few moments to just sit or
stand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let your body remain still.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you rate on a scale from 1 to 10 how
easy is it for you to remain still?
[SPEAKER_05]: How comfortable are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you put a fake smile on your
face.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it a few seconds and see how real
that can become.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just check in with yourself and see how
authentically content you feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: On a scale from 1 to 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those three numbers written down before
and after you use cannabis each time and
[SPEAKER_05]: then you can look back at that as a trend
will tell you a lot about if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: getting the dosing right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I just say what he said?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I think would be most helpful is I
often tell my patients, please,
[SPEAKER_01]: please, please track and log what products
you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you throw the package away before you
throw it away, write down what it says on
[SPEAKER_01]: the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you may try five different
products and say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That first one was the one I really liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh shoot, I can't remember what brand
it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had situations where I've had
patients use something that they really
[SPEAKER_01]: liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they went back and it wasn't
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they tried a few other things and then
they don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for one particular patient,
we have tried so many things and she
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot remember the name of and what it
was and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do encourage people to journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are online, you can buy,
if you want to write things down,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can buy medical, they actually have
cannabis journals that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ask you what's the product and they give
you space to put the CBD THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also apps where you can put your
information in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you want to go, you know,
cheap and easy, go to the drug store and
[SPEAKER_01]: buy a notebook and just put the date down
and put down the products you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think journaling is huge to be able to
narrow in on what helps you the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the most important thing about
dosing is managing expectations for a
[SPEAKER_02]: patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one of the most fascinating things
about medical cannabis is that one
[SPEAKER_02]: person's benefit is another person's side
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really have to help them understand
what they might feel if it's not what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're expecting to treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I take something for sleep and I get
the euphoria or the good feelings,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have a really honest conversation about
what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've just said a lot of the points I
would make, but education is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having frequent check-ins and monitoring I
find very helpful and making changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were using oils, try
vaporization and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's CBD, maybe it's THC,
maybe it's THCA, try another products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing we haven't really talked
about is recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do recommend the exact same
things for recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that would be what I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a lot of expectations for
recreational purposes, but I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in Canada, we're changing the
packaging come this fall in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going to be available is using a
logical approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the full package of gummy bears
is a thousand milligrams, people may take
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand and think that that's what the
dose is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, again, would be a mindful
approach to recreational use as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: These to all the product makers here,
it's okay if you label the total content
[SPEAKER_05]: per bottle, but put something a little
more specific around an actual dosage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very helpful for patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Milligrams per milliliter, milligrams per
dose, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, per piece, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd just like to close and say to me,
this was extremely valuable because you've
[SPEAKER_04]: got it from in the trenches here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of the trenches, I want to
take my hat off and give these guys a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: applause.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are medical warriors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for what you do.
Thank you.
