[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned rescheduling,
and I think that's something that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: all sort of watching and hopeful for,
that we'll see some movement there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say it does get rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, what, schedule three is what's on
the table here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would things change for you if that
were to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to change a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So schedule three is like ketamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think tonic code number three is in
schedule three also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, it's still going to be
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But locally, I could do a prospective
study looking at cannabis in a treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: of, I'm going to give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a protocol, which I wrote for
this, for chronic migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Migraine is defined by reporting 15
headaches a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can look at a placebo or a 20 to
one, one to one ratio, five, 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, 20 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a prospective study.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be several arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask me who's going to fund that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say right now, nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to fund it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fund it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a benevolent family, Dent family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dent was a philanthropist back in the
sixties who, by the way, had Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, started an institute in 1963.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a family, non-for-profit
family foundation that supports research
[SPEAKER_00]: within the Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, by the way, for the last six,
seven years have unequivocally supported
[SPEAKER_00]: my research in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has given me the opportunity to
publish, to put us on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still support, but we're not
talking about millions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about significant amount,
but they do support us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm going to get some seed money
from them to support a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can do that, if it becomes a schedule
three drug, and then I can publish that
[SPEAKER_00]: article, prospectively randomized study,
part of the money from seed money from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dent family foundation, part of the money
through the Dent cannabis clinic will,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we'll readjust money to put it
in research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of putting it in our pockets,
we'll put it in research, self-funded,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to use the term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can publish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we publish that, I could show it to
the insurance companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show it to the medical societies and
then let them critique it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of the things is one of
the problems I think you may understand is
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, medical marijuana or medical
cannabis programs are too expensive for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did it a way about, I did a way you
don't have to pay me cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a positive for the patient,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have to pay in cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these patients are paying $800
a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me be honest with you,
in the medical marijuana program,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the people can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they can't afford it,
and the insurance companies throw their
[SPEAKER_00]: arms up and say, you know, we're
sympathetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that if you put somebody on
medical marijuana, they'll take less
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids, they'll take less Xanax,
they'll take less sleeping pills,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll take less anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good for the insurance companies,
but they fall back on the fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: no research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have a prospective study,
the first thing I'm going to do is present
[SPEAKER_00]: it to every CEO of every insurance
company, because let's pay for this
[SPEAKER_00]: because A, I save you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep patients out of emergency rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have less testing because their
quality of life have improved and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using less drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing I'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may change something at that
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the medical societies will look at
it, critique it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be published in peer-reviewed
journals, which is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we start moving at the medical
society level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm optimistic that for me,
it's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a step in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's going to help the
business of cannabis, because that's still
[SPEAKER_00]: federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still taxation issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still banking issues, as you all
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't get involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just read what I read.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my perspective, I think it's a
positive move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So will insurance companies, they will,
well, I mean, there's a lot that goes into
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but it being a schedule three drug
would not preclude them from covering it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a schedule three drug,
but anything you use it for, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: off-label because it's off-label because
it's not been approved in that disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, what disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: Say migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it easy.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 million migraineurs in this country,
36 or 700,000 patients in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States with MS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they approve it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't because show me the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I prove a drug off-label that
there's no science that shows it works?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go testimonials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have patients who can't live
without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testimonials don't count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Randomized phase two, phase three studies
do count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we'll have to do and we'll
do it.
Okay.
