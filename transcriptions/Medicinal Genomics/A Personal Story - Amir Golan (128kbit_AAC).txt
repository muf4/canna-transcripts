[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone once told me that the best
speeches come from heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, my heart speaks Hebrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a bit of a struggle,
but we're all in this together,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think we'll make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Amir Golan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Israel, 26 years old,
and a third year medical student at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have come here today to present to you a
brief account of my personal connection
[SPEAKER_00]: with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of both my future status as a
medical team member, as well as my
[SPEAKER_00]: currently status as a patient treated
within Israel Cannabis Medical Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the age of 20, about six years ago,
and in the middle of my military service,
[SPEAKER_00]: I began feeling ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost weight, had abdominal pains,
and a decreased ability of properly
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the view of a rather typical military
service, further personal complaints were
[SPEAKER_00]: delayed for several months until it became
clear that indeed something was seriously
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sent me to some laboratory tests
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And following those serious laboratory
tests and a colonoscopy, I was informed
[SPEAKER_00]: about the diagnosis, Crohn's disease,
IBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so medical treatment consisting of
steroids was initiated at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a two-week period of steroid
treatment, which wasn't effective at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: my doctors put me on anti-TNF medication,
also called Remicade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And following several sessions on this
drug, it was seemingly a slight
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement, but the laboratory test
results, as well as my general well-being,
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 80% or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, my grandfather, Professor
Rafael Mishulam, who I'm sure some of you
[SPEAKER_00]: have heard about, was personally engaged
and actively participated in a study
[SPEAKER_00]: concerning Crohn's disease and medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a discussion between my doctor,
my grandfather, and myself, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: decided on adding medical cannabis to my
biological treatment regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis strain, which I'm treated
with, contains a relatively small amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC and a high content of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio is about four to one,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which, on the basis of earlier data,
was found to have some anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, I'm feeling fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This treatment regime amounting by now to
more than a continuous four years of
[SPEAKER_00]: remission, both clinically and also
laboratory, and others in some minor
[SPEAKER_00]: scarring at the terminal ileum as a
testimony of prior inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in a completely normal, non-clinical
state of both the pathological signs and
[SPEAKER_00]: the symptoms which I previously suffered
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beside being a medical student and a
patient, I'm also a research assistant at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hebrew University Cannabinoid Research
Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mainly focus on liver cirrhosis,
but this is not for today, for another
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, cannabis plays an important
role in both my personal life,
[SPEAKER_00]: my work, and my studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that puts me in a rather
unique position in which I can see a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of every aspect of the Israeli
medical cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, I'm very fortunate of being
here with you and discussing a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: related issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I want to talk about is
the medical cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm most certain that Dr. Dorr's
presentation gave you more than enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I intend to limit myself to just a few
topics from my point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is the research,
that Israel consists of such a pioneering
[SPEAKER_00]: nations and manifold aspects of medical
cannabis, regarding from the discovery of
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system itself to the
recent research regarding epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: as Dr. Dorr said, and much, much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the advanced research
enables a relatively quick approval of new
[SPEAKER_00]: indications for the patients, and the
connection between the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: community and the regulatory body is very
tight and beneficial for the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is the governmental
control, and especially the thing that the
[SPEAKER_00]: program in Israel is right now a
non-profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The payment is fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay about $100 a month, regardless of
the amount you're prescribed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am entitled to 20 grams a month,
which is, I think, the minimal amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: as most IBD patients receive the cannabis
for the inflammation and not the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pay as much as someone who's getting
a hungry gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is that the payment is
limited for merely covering expenditures
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with matters of growth,
cultivation, shipment, and supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the governmental
financial support, together with the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-profit and not-so-small number of
commercial companies involving in
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying the drug, leads to an
affordable, high-quality drug product
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of relatively negative aspects,
there are also a number of issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: and among them, the particular issue of
restrictive regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Dr. Dorr said, all prescriptions have
to be reviewed and confirmed by a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: committee at the Ministry of Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: In new initial applications, as well as
any subsequent prescriptions renewal
[SPEAKER_00]: request.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years, the number of such
applications has rapidly increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a struggle for the Ministry
of Health to keep up with the pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may cause delays in renewal and
cause problems to some of the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the problem of centralized
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, and such a most relevant
topic, is that in Israel, like here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: States, cannabis is regarded as a class
one drug, a thing that puts a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions on both the patients and the
researchers on this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I would like to devote a few
sentences as to medical cannabis-related
[SPEAKER_00]: issues and its contents within the study
program at our medical school in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerusalem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thus, throughout recent years,
our study program included several hours
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis especially in our
pharmacology course, primarily in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: its potential analectic properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, particular emphasis was
placed on the investigation concerning the
[SPEAKER_00]: involvement of the endocannabinoid system
and its therapeutic applicability in cases
[SPEAKER_00]: of chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of alternatively in combination
with opioid treatment, which is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: high profile research nowadays,
I don't need to tell you that,
[SPEAKER_00]: this likewise includes some clinical
presentation with patients that came to
[SPEAKER_00]: class, to a lecture hall bigger than that,
to tell all of us about their treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they told us that some of them are
treated with opioids, some with opioids
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis, which allow them to reduce
significantly the number of opioids being
[SPEAKER_00]: taken, and some can manage their pain with
cannabis alone, which I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on all of those presentations and
classes, it became clearly evident that
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis does not represent a
magical drug, but rather an effective
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic mean of reducing pain,
among other things, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: and although requiring further scientific
investigation and research towards showing
[SPEAKER_00]: its full spectrum and pharmacological
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ought to be noted that in the course of
those clinical presentations, it appeared
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of the attending physicians,
it was a considerable variability to their
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge in this specific area,
and I myself am fully confident that any
[SPEAKER_00]: future medical generations, in Israel at
least, will be better equipped towards
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing and having the required profound
and basic scientific knowledge about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, what indeed can be expected in
the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my opinion that for most among the
most relevant topic and upon the
[SPEAKER_00]: prevailing therapeutic and even commercial
aspects of this field is that still we
[SPEAKER_00]: need a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially the thing that I think is most
important in recent future regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: research is that effective treatment,
which means strain to indication,
[SPEAKER_00]: and route of administration, which
presently is primarily based on inhalatory
[SPEAKER_00]: or smoking or vaping route, and thereby
raising possible health risks and damages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is an additional highly
relevant topic is education, medical
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Israel, the recognition as to the
applicable respective importance and
[SPEAKER_00]: relevance has already begun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus through the overall issue of
medical cannabis usage and medical needs
[SPEAKER_00]: are presently dealt in ever increasing
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And accordingly, I think that a properly
trained and informed physician in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular area will undoubtedly be better
equipped towards offering the most
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant treatment for his or her
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that if you're going to invest
in something in the near future,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should be medical education and
effective, safe route of administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you all for listening to
my story today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
