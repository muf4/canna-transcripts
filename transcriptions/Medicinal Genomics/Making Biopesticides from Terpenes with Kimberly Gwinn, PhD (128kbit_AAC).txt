[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this episode is Dr. Kimberly
Gwynne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim is a professor of entomology and plant
pathology at the University of Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her lab currently investigates natural
products that are produced by plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes and their use as medicines and as
biopesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 24, she will present hemp
processing byproducts as biopesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: which describes her team's work using
terpene-rich industrial hemp byproducts to
[SPEAKER_00]: control plant diseases and pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discuss why terpenes are effective
biopesticides, which pathogens and pests
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene-rich biopesticides can fight,
what are nanoemulsions and why are they
[SPEAKER_00]: important to this application,
how this technology can open up a new
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue stream for growers, the regulatory
lift for getting biopesticides approved,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with Kim,
I'd like to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare Earth Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare Earth Genomics is a dynamic
partnership formed with Texas A&M
[SPEAKER_00]: AgriLife, one of the world's leading
research institutions to accelerate hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: research and create tools for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their mission is to increase the
likelihood of a successful harvest for
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers through genetic analysis and
rigorous environmental testing of vigorous
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at rareearthgenomics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Dr. Kimberly Gwynn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is delightful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited to talk with you today about
a novel technology that you and your team
[SPEAKER_00]: have developed to use hemp-derived
terpenes as biopesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you will be presenting this
work at CanMed 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: This May in Marco Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a good place to start with
this conversation would be for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain how your team came up with this
idea and why you started investigating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been very interested in
biopesticides for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they are a good way that we
can be more environmentally friendly in
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the problems with biopesticides is
where do we get our materials?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have been looking in several
different areas for agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: byproducts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those byproducts can bring more
revenue to growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of my take on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My colleague, Dr. Tony Wong, is a food
scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's been very involved in developing
these nanoemulsions for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've teamed together to develop
this biopesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of led you down the path of
using terpenes from the hemp byproducts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, terpenes are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are like one of these things that
we can use for a number of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think about terpenes, you think about
their smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can be used to prevent things from
happening like an insect landing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also be used to encourage an
insect to land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will also affect how a fungus can
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are part of the plant's natural
defense system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we are doing is taking the hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just using hemp in this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take the hemp and we use its natural
defense chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we turn those around and bottle them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And turn them into an emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then use them as biopesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about byproducts,
so is this hemp being grown particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: for CBD or cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so you're sort of using the
cast-off terpenes to create this
[SPEAKER_00]: biopesticide?
Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are only looking at what is coming from
the CBD because that is where a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes are being discarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they go for the cannabinoids,
then the terpenes are left behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we are interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do growers need to sort of modify how
they're already getting the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to sort of access these
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the product, at least in hemp,
is the CBD and is the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the manufacturers extract want to
maximize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And leaving behind the terpenes is not
part of their business plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really care about the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except, you know, whenever you're looking
at the whole product, then you do care
[SPEAKER_01]: about the terpenes because that's what
allows you to have particular types of
[SPEAKER_01]: smells and tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned before that you've been
investigating biocontrol agents for quite
[SPEAKER_00]: some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some other solutions that are
available to growers and how do they
[SPEAKER_00]: differ from this approach?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the EPA's list of
pesticides that are approved for hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: production, you will find pretty much only
biopesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's one conventional and it's
an herbicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are from the name plant and
also some microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some microorganisms are very,
very helpful in controlling the natural
[SPEAKER_01]: environment on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants are just like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of their microbiome actually
effectively bites off the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do with a biocontrol agent is
we put that on the plant and help the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant stimulate its natural defenses and
also some of those actually actively fight
[SPEAKER_01]: against pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned hemp specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was going to be one of my
questions was, is this biocontrol agent
[SPEAKER_00]: specific to whether it be hemp or cannabis
or could this potentially be used on other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've expanded to other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been testing some cucurbits this
past year, both in the greenhouse and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what are the pathogens that you're
sort of targeting with this approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's fungi, there's bacteria,
there's weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sort of all of the above or are
there specific ones that you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that you have to be
careful about when you develop a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: biopesticide is that it is not phytotoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in its very, very most concentrated
form that we could possibly make,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could be used as an herbicide,
but that's probably not going to be where
[SPEAKER_01]: we go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been, we've actually been able to
control powdery mildew on hemp with this
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's worked as well as any of the
commercial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better than some of them too.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I know powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other sort of targets are you looking
for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just recently switched my interest to
Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been screening different
Fusarium pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This hasn't been done on the plant,
but it's been done in the lab and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: very effective growth control on the
Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned nano emulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those listeners and hosts who might
not be familiar with what exactly that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: could you sort of explain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's go back to the very basics on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very basics are what is an emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can think about an emulsion as
very, very simple as making salad
[SPEAKER_01]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take your oil and your vinegar and you
shake it and you get something that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: very different than oil and vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's going to be a very,
very weak emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to separate out in some cases
before you can even get it out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle onto your salad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we do with a nano emulsion is we
make those little oil droplets very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nano means like 10 to the ninth when
you're talking about things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we make these very small and we
suspend the terpenes in these compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: in these little oil bubbles essentially,
and they will stay in solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been able to keep them on the lab
bench at room temperature for over two
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's in water?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in water and we use a natural soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called tween.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically we are going for things that
are extremely safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we only use products in what we're
doing that are considered to be grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grass is G-R-A-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an FDA category that's generally
regarded as safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bottom line is this is a pesticide
that you could probably eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wouldn't advise it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells very strong, but we are trying
to make it as safe as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm glad you brought that up because
obviously, yeah, terpenes, they smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're adding these to the
plant, is it going to affect, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's cannabis, it's one thing,
but if you're looking to put this on other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, is it going to affect the smell,
taste of those crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we would have a limit of how
late we can spray this on some crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you wouldn't want to dunk
your apple in it and keep that as a
[SPEAKER_01]: post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you spray like the kubits,
we didn't affect the quality of those by
[SPEAKER_01]: doing earlier sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did not spray the fruit themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in most cases, we're not looking for
the plant as the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at a fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have to be careful when you
can spray those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also remember that terpenes are
ephemeral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even ours will eventually go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a feeling that we won't be
using them on post-harvest because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it will affect consumer taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there are a number of different
terpenes that the plant produces as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there specific ones that you're
interested in?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not focused on any specific one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is we want to be able to
use these byproducts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have used but we've done this
technology for a couple of different
[SPEAKER_01]: extractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we seem to get the same effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think when an extractor goes in,
they have all kinds of different plant
[SPEAKER_01]: types and cultivars that they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really can't control that if we're
using it as a waste product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have this analyzed and we know
what the terpenes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what residual CBD is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are trying our best not to really
pay that much attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at it as a whole product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ones that are there are the ones
that when we test them in the lab are
[SPEAKER_01]: antifungal and anti-insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this not limited to just terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just spoke with a gentleman who
published this whole paper about other
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that produce aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's esters and all these other names
that I'm not, I can't recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are those coming along for the ride
too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kind of specifically sticking to
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've focused on terpenes because that's
really what is the dominant smell in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know those will provide the compound,
the activities that we are interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis sativa is like the miracle plant
as far as metabolism goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces so many different compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a paper out there from
several years ago that calls it the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: of thousands of molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know what's coming along for
the ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that CBD, we have a small
percentage of the CBD is in there as well
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of the CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is the extraction technique that's
used does that play a role here too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there certain ones that are better for
this than others?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been looking primarily at ones that
have had an ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that the same type of
material is evolved when you use
[SPEAKER_01]: supercritical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, so what is the goal here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it that eventually growers will be able
to sort of formulate their own
[SPEAKER_00]: biopesticides or is that something that
sort of a specific company that needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think you're probably going to
have to have that done by somebody because
[SPEAKER_01]: our equipment is very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a high sonication.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it, but it's not going to be
as good as ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to stay in solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it with a sonicator.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a high, speed sonicator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've spent a lot of time getting the
conditions that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We produce it just right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but if you have that material,
you can certainly replicate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've published our methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but could it be something that,
you know, growers sort of, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd be an extra revenue stream for them
that they could be providing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that waste material to, to your company or
whoever, whoever's going to develop this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dream is to get extra revenue for
growers, get a safe biopesticide for
[SPEAKER_01]: producers and, you know, expand this
because, you know, if you have something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is naturally broken down by
whatever's in the environment on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil and that type of thing,
that's these natural products are broken
[SPEAKER_01]: down easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: More easily than synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you, so you have some things
environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have something that growers get an
extra revenue stream from and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have all of those three things,
you've got the kind of the pillars of
[SPEAKER_01]: developing a biopesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where are we at in terms of sort of
evaluating whether it works or actually
[SPEAKER_00]: getting to market?
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of where are you at there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm, I'm hoping that the interest
from CanMed will bring people around that
[SPEAKER_01]: want to invest in it, to be honest with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would love to see this go into a
company and develop this technology so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it can be available to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is sort of the, how do you get
something like this approved?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the sort of agencies that dictate
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's EPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, there are, there are rules for
biopesticides for developing those that
[SPEAKER_01]: are less stringent than those for
synthetics, because most of those things
[SPEAKER_01]: are natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would go through the EPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would, we would then, you know,
we would tell them everything that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: ours and how it is used and how it's
formulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would, show them the efficacy
because they don't approve it unless it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will do that, but they have
approved other essential oils like garlic
[SPEAKER_01]: oil, rosemary oil, those types of things
are already approved as biopesticides and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the same terpenes are in those as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was going to be one of my
questions too, because I know that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis hemp, that's not the
only plant that produces terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are there other, other products out
there that utilize terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that essentially, when you hear
the word essential oil, that's probably a
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've looked at, in the past, I've looked
at terpenes from a genus of mint called
[SPEAKER_01]: Menarda, which is bee balm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got the most amazing different
types of terpenes based on cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually were able to chemo type them
by their, by their terpene chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had mentioned other biopesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there were some other control
agents before, in that sometimes they use
[SPEAKER_00]: actually microbes, whether it be bacteria
or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that those can actually
contribute to some of these total count
[SPEAKER_00]: tests that growers need to pass in order
to get the products to market,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's totally yeast and mold or
total bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would imagine that this would be
helpful for, for those growers because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not using those microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of those things as we
talked about the, you know, when you
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, you know, this might be helpful
in reducing those counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've tested it against Fusarium,
which is one of the pathogens that affects
[SPEAKER_01]: the inflorescence, but we haven't done any
other testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for right now, that's sort of
conjecture on my part, but it's something
[SPEAKER_01]: that we definitely want to look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds definitely promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, you know, growers are
struggling a lot with Aspergillus being
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them and Empythium as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure those are already on your
radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspergillus is definitely on our radar
because Aspergillus can cause problems in
[SPEAKER_01]: humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can colonize the lungs and cause a
syndrome called Aspergilliosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has been connected with cannabis
use, but in immunocompromised people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's rare, but something we
definitely, we like to test for.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Kim, well, winding down here,
I want to give you the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: share any other links or mention any other
resources that folks might be interested
[SPEAKER_00]: to read more about sort of the work that
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also any websites, social media,
any ways that folks can kind of get in
[SPEAKER_00]: touch with you or learn more about the
work you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sort of an old school scientist,
so I don't have a lot of social media
[SPEAKER_01]: presence, but we are working right now on
some of the Fusarium pathogens,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at how to control those in the
inflorescence and looking at the potential
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have for producing mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at that as that's where a
lot of my future work will be focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully I can combine these two and
we can use this to control Fusarium in the
[SPEAKER_01]: inflorescence, because I think that it's
probably more of a problem than we think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of Fusarium disease out there in
greenhouse production as well as field
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we kind of just launched a new
Fusarium assay for growers, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there's one scientist
that's going to be at CanMed, Dr. Zamir
[SPEAKER_00]: Poonja, who's done a lot of research into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you guys can connect him,
Marco Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Zamir and I have published together
and we actually were at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: institution at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very familiar with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then you guys will get to catch up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again, Kim, for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to meeting you in
person at CanMed24.
