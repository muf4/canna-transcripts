[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, good afternoon to you all,
and many thanks for the introduction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and thank you to the organizers for the
invitation to talk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a psychopharmacologist from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you probably don't know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main contribution to the field so far
was identification of the endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism of allosteric modulation at CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, I dare to come here to talk
about a meta-analysis study I did on the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential benefits of CBD or epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing together all the viable clinical
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's appropriate to express my
conflict of interest, because I recently
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted a new challenge in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm leading product development as a
scientific director in Entourage Phytolab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entourage is a startup pharmaceutical
company who is starting to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-based products, starting from
varieties of Bedrocan in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are the exclusive partners of
Bedrocan in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, today I'm going to talk
about this meta-analysis studies of CBD on
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole field is being pushed by
stories like this one that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte Fige, a small child with
treatment resistant epilepsy, who started
[SPEAKER_00]: to take and benefit from cannabis-based
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many other stories like
hers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Brazil, we also have our Charlotte
Fige.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's called Annie Fisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture here with her family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by starting taking these products,
in particular, high CBD varieties of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, she went from 64 convulsions per
week to zero, as his dad, Norberto Fisher,
[SPEAKER_00]: is saying in this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the patient zero in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was the first patient to receive the
authorization to import cannabis-based
[SPEAKER_00]: products in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there on, there's a lot of other
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's starting to import these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying import because they're not a
single registered product on Brazil right
[SPEAKER_00]: now for these children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there is Sativex, which was
recently registered, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: available yet in the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Sativex is not the best
option for these children.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, we have over 2,000 people
being able to import cannabis-based
[SPEAKER_00]: products in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vast majority of them are
epileptic patients, I would say close to
[SPEAKER_00]: 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a lot of products available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's quite confusing at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients don't know how to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pressing the clinicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctors don't know exactly what is the
difference between the products and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that these products are not
standardized and these FDA warning letters
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that they might contain
contaminants, herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cannot trust in the levels of
cannabinoids that they express in the
[SPEAKER_00]: labels don't help at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the gap we want to fill with
the better kind of varieties and proper
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical development in enteroid
phytolab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the behavior of Brazilian
clinicians right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to say there's not enough
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very comfortable, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a patient is pressuring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of clinical reports,
study reports, sorry, case reports,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we saw this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the physicians are saying there's not
enough evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sitting there comfortably in the
chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we rely on just a few pioneers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just a handful or two of
Brazilian clinicians who are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to name here Paulo da Estela,
which is in the audience, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pioneers treating over 100 patients with
this kind of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I mean, no matter what we do,
people are starting to take these
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do they work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly, especially because
when it comes to herbal products,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are not standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to raise evidence
using these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, we do have some evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I propose to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I search for a child together with
epilepsy and cannabis, cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol, all sorts of things to do a
systematic review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea was to really dig into this
data and see whether there is any
[SPEAKER_00]: coherence between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could find six papers in the first
search.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had another one by hand,
which was impressed at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a few data from the partial
public reports of JW.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the viable clinical data that I
included in the systematic review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're all respected
neurology centers, mostly from US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are different designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see retrospective and prospective
medical records, some with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, some not, and different
durations of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to summarize in the next slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the characteristics of these studies
are children and adolescents with
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment-resistant epilepsy, most of them
with epileptic encephalopathy,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Dravet and Lano-Gastaut,
which is very important in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many, many cases, patients tried at
least four different treatments,
[SPEAKER_00]: but up to 12 different treatments before
trying CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very treatment-resistant
population, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's summed up to 442 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of evidence with an average
treatment duration of half a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the products are either CBD-rich
extracts or purified CBD, with a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: range, wide dose range, which is always
intriguing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we talk to the patients and the
clinicians who are supporting the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, the majority of the case are in
the low-dose range, one maybe to five
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per kilo per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's in clear contrast to what we
see in the clinical trials reported so
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something I wanted to
understand using this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main objective with this thematic
review was to understand whether there was
[SPEAKER_00]: any consistent evidence of efficacy and
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also tried to understand whether
there were different between people using
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD-rich extracts and purified CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you know that cannabis
phyto-complex has a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to mention the potential anti-aplatic
compounds, we have, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the obvious thing, GAC is also
anti-aplatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even more potent than CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, it has a more restrict
therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we have GACV, CBDV, CBN,
and also non-cannabinoid compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Linalal and Mersin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the table that summarized the
efficacy results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to show that there are
different efficacy rates in different
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them are complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you see the numbers
fluctuating in the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to summarize it and make it
very visual to be easier to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first things first.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was clear evidence of efficacy in a
treatment-resistant population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when asked, did the treatment improve
the seizures, 66% of the patients or the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents said, yes, there was improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 66%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you consider the traditional threshold
of improving more than 50% to be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered a responder, then this number
is down to 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say 1 third of people are
considered responders when taking
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD-based medicines, which is still a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, remember that we're talking about
treatment-resistant population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one in every three patients are
benefiting from that in a very rigorous
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are evidence of superior efficacy in
this particular population in Dravet
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome compared to the general
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for Lenaud-Gastaut, at least in this
cohort, in this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here come the more surprising things
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we split between the purified CBD and
CBD-based extracts, there are a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of improvement in herbal CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a nickname here in the slides,
just to make it easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are higher improvement here than on
purified CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't hold true when you consider
just the responders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both high, so 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no difference in this case
when you consider just people that achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 50% of improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here comes the more striking thing,
at least for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average dose reported by people taking
purified CBD is close to 20 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram per day, whereas people taking
CBD-based extracts report an average dose
[SPEAKER_00]: of 7 milligrams per kilogram per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite striking, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's three times different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it means that there is
something else in these extracts which are
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperating for the CBD with effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would say that CBD is more potent
when given in fight extracts than
[SPEAKER_00]: purified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are adverse events
reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is quite often overlap with
efficacy, so it's close to half percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: people report efficacy, but they also
report adverse event, most of them mild,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a small fraction of people report
severe adverse events, and the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: ones is appetite alteration, sonolence,
gastrointestinal pain or diarrhea,
[SPEAKER_00]: alterations in weight, fatigue and nausea,
and rare and uncommon adverse events also
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, but most of the time in
combination with other drugs, valporic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid and clobazan as highlights.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did this split in data for mild
adverse events, there's also this
[SPEAKER_00]: difference, a high report of mild adverse
events in purified CBD than on CBD-based
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts, and this is also true for severe
adverse events, a higher report for
[SPEAKER_00]: purified CBD than herbal CBD, and of
course, it's important to mention that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is all the adverse events which were
reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not necessarily attributed
directly to the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a highlight from one of the studies
describing over 100 patients, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a very important one to be made,
is that the profile of adverse events was
[SPEAKER_00]: already very high when people were taking
the anti-inconvulsive medicines before
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, and most of them, almost all,
went down when CBD was included.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two of them went up, which is weight
gain and increased appetite, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly a bad adverse event, it's
considered a beneficial one in some
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, for instance, oncological
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, other aspects that
are improved by CBD, aspects of quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: life, even despite efficacy in some cases,
people report improvements in alertness,
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep, humor, behavior, language,
and motor skills, stating that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive development of these children
has been improved by the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: To conclude, so I'd say yes, there are
evidence CBD works for epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least as far as this observational
clinical data in treatment-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: population is concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract composition here is very,
very key, so one must understand what kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis strain, what is the stability
of the compounds, quality controls must
[SPEAKER_00]: improve a lot in these products,
and CBD-rich extract seems to be a better
[SPEAKER_00]: choice over purified CBD, at least in this
population, in this meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my contact for those who are
interested to extend this conversation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'd say that, of course, we will
benefit from controlled clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not enough evidence is not a
reasonable excuse anymore to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: patients from having access to these
medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
