[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to repeat our last speaker and
first say thank you to Medicinal Genomics,
[SPEAKER_01]: Advanced Nutrients, for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, probably address the question
that you either saw reading the agenda or
[SPEAKER_01]: you thought of sitting here or you're
seeing with this title.
[SPEAKER_01]: What in the world can a plant scientist
from Texas estate with one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging, deficient, or add your own
expletive term medical policies have in a
[SPEAKER_01]: conference full of medical practitioners?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would hope with a little bit of
transfer of knowledge and exercise,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can demonstrate that it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first request I would have,
would you, everyone that's here,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have a cell phone, would you hold
up your cell phone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody here not have a cell phone?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single one of you is holding a
handheld phonomic tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just playing games on it and not
using it for what it could be used for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my transfer learning exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background is printing of grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 plus years, three in cannabis,
so I am not a legacy breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am an upstart, a newb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a love of viewing plants as
biorefineries, integrated biorefineries,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is from brilliant scientists in
Germany who corrupted me, influenced me
[SPEAKER_01]: back in 2006 and 2007 when I was turning
grass into ethanol or biofuels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to put on a second hat,
which is good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am follically challenged.
[SPEAKER_01]: I not only work with perennial grasses,
I now work with industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And industrial hemp, to me, is not one
commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as many commodities as you can create
from that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an integrated biorefinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's built that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be the best example of a plant
biorefinery out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I leave out all the perennial grass
work and just focus on what we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to do in hemp, it is a biorefinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to boil this down even
further to our handheld phonomics scope
[SPEAKER_01]: for this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our breeding program views it as such.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on multiuse hemp,
fiber, grain, cannabinoid, any use of
[SPEAKER_01]: those, anything you can convert with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a plant breeder, hemp has not been
advanced in a conventional sense compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to corn, other major crops in 80 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of our work is to make modern
types of cultivars, pure lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: F1 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your plant patents on one,
your plant variety patents on the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have rock solid intellectual
property.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tetraploids, things I've done in perennial
grasses that's popular in hemp now,
[SPEAKER_01]: triploid, seed sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are your seedless bananas,
seedless grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do that with CBD hemp now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no concern for pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type 5s, everything in this conference has
to do with type 1s and 2s, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: type 3s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type 5s have their place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas, southern U.S., we're here in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heat and drought tolerance, if we're going
to move this crop outdoors, as some have
[SPEAKER_01]: proposed, is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of our work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started working in hemp three
years ago, I had absolutely zero seed in
[SPEAKER_01]: my seed room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to develop a germplasm
collection that's available, it's public,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's adapted to subtropical and
tropical latitudes is also a big part of
[SPEAKER_01]: our program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the very bottom of that
picture on the right, that's really where
[SPEAKER_01]: we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to introduce just three
little components to try to make my job
[SPEAKER_01]: easier as a plant breeder where we need
things to look at plants, get data points
[SPEAKER_01]: rapidly and cost efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say there's not an argument of
university versus industry doing this kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are university scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are an arm of industry for their
research, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, disclosure, I do work for a
behemoth of a bureaucracy, universities,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we are regulated by the states as are
in all states that have cannabis policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, we have a lot of supporting
offices at A&M that are involved with
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a beautiful office that helps us
engage with industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have faculty and extension that are
running trials on cropping systems and how
[SPEAKER_01]: to get this outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have people working on hop latent
pathologists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have gene editing being conducted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have students very,
very interested in this, so much so they
[SPEAKER_01]: have started the only university organized
club around cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, repeating to some of the ethos
of this conference, I'm going to propose
[SPEAKER_01]: broad spectrum, if not full spectrum,
but broad spectrum approaches of what we
[SPEAKER_01]: all do, what you all do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're bringing light to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these phenomics tools are around three
specific portions of that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first tool, this has been the toughest
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had more failures than I would like,
but not as many as Edison had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a tool now that's very
interesting, and it's based around
[SPEAKER_01]: near-infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Near-infrared has been around for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: In forages, we use that to quantify all
sorts of composition and quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a stretch to say that's
already in the book and canned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miniaturized versions of these,
they were put on cell phones seven,
[SPEAKER_01]: eight years ago, 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just make your iPhone three times
as expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much of a customer base for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But miniature NIRS platforms are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Workflows that are very typical of these
types of approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Screen large populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Develop your modeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Validate those models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercialize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all already, too, with
miniaturized NIRS platforms specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all are, I'm sure, aware of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Gemacert and the Purple Fro.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are both based on diffuse
reflectance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both require dried, cured samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do give you a cost savings versus
HPLC or GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest reasons they have not
been adopted widely is you cannot get
[SPEAKER_01]: really high precisions or accuracies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two to four percent in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they may argue you can do this in real
time, but in reality, you have to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: dried, cured sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to avoid the water bands and
those reflectance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it limits you in those two respects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the problem we wanted
to tackle with this as a breeding tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last three years, thankfully,
we've also been able to develop our germ
[SPEAKER_01]: plasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have large, segregating populations for
THC, CBD, and many of these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the NIR.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done phenomics in my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done these things with UAV data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done this with a ground penetrating
radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the analytics side and the modeling is
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's missing we want to tackle with this
tool was the sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: What and how you're going to sample,
what and how you're going to take the data
[SPEAKER_01]: point, and how you're going to process
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apologize for this being a black
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: This took longer than I wanted it to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have three very novel, very
non-obvious components of how we're
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting this data, how we're sampling
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have enabled this to the point
where it is accurate, much more than the
[SPEAKER_01]: two products on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition, it lets us sample dry or
wet tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be very non-destructive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be done anywhere in the life cycle
of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives us something that is
patentable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We disclose that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that bureaucracy I mentioned that
moves slow, sometimes slower than rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of a freeze dryer, is still
reviewing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plan is to put IP protection on
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that license will be held by our
sponsors who are here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rare Genomics, they enable this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we are their research arm in this
effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you'd like to visit with them,
if you haven't seen them yet, please
[SPEAKER_01]: search them out or come find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to introduce you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving from infrared to visible,
this has been something as an academic
[SPEAKER_01]: professor, undergraduate classes,
graduate students, the student clubs,
[SPEAKER_01]: students in my lab working on trichomes,
these beautiful structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look at dioxide full of things that we
use and the colors that they reflect,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to gauge trichome size,
maturity, and their other secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been very easy to adopt with the
advance of your cell phones and very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very small microscopes you can put on
those foam attachments now that have
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful optics, almost to the stage of
1,000x ocular magnification.
[SPEAKER_01]: You combine those with those two apps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost any person within half an hour can
get pictures of trichomes at 600x
[SPEAKER_01]: magnification, calibrate those scales,
and get your diameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larger trick is to try to quantify how
much you have on a bud, on a brack leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that with a little bit of image
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are older technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: ImageJ, OpenSea, you can use these in open
source scripts.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, you're making grayscale images
and looking for circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trichome size is one of the easier
ones to attack with digital microscopy
[SPEAKER_01]: with your cell phones and a little bit of
image analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maturity is much more difficult simply due
to the fact that when you use these
[SPEAKER_01]: algorithms, they're all based around
grayscale images so that you lose all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that data you need to gauge maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we struggled with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at different approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can pull out of those images.
[SPEAKER_01]: And recently, it dawned on me to stop
thinking linearly, stop thinking in two
[SPEAKER_01]: dimensions, start thinking in three
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every image you take is not a
two-dimensional image.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's data in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's data in those pixels beyond RGB.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the additional data,
you can project that data and make a 3D
[SPEAKER_01]: rendition of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any computer science kid that uses these
graphics to make mesh video games or
[SPEAKER_01]: cartoons or comics or videos can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're projecting some portion of the data
in that 2D image to get more 3D
[SPEAKER_01]: projections of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing we noticed was an
imagery trichome is clear, optically
[SPEAKER_01]: clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you get back is the green of the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first difficulty in doing that is you
get rid of the green.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's world, we have blockbuster
films that are covered in green screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to remove the green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in our case, we found not a need to
remove all of the green, but some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: green spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, you're left with a lot of
trichome data and what's in the trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you will take that, minus the green
and the middle row there across maturity
[SPEAKER_01]: of trichomes, you can then pick,
you can experiment with what versions of
[SPEAKER_01]: data you would like to project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found is looking at luminosity
or the overall brightness of those pixels,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can project those up vertically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you work with the saturation,
saturation is simply the pure colors of
[SPEAKER_01]: those pixels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all like highly saturated pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like pure blue, pure red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do that, you end up with 3D
projections.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see on the left, immature largely
blue pixels are projected up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairly mature trichomes, largely green,
some yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very mature, sometimes overly mature,
lots of orange and reds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the beautiful thing is once you have
these 3D projections, if you go one step
[SPEAKER_01]: further and quantify the degree of
redness, you could calibrate this to
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest at your optimum degree of amber
trichomes, depending on what your target
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to streamline this for breeders and
other practitioners, if you can envision
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this at a lower magnification,
you would make it easier for someone
[SPEAKER_01]: walking through there with a cell phone,
which can almost get you to 20X optical
[SPEAKER_01]: magnification and produce images like this
of an entire bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You follow the same workflow, remove the
green, do a 3D projection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get an absolute estimation of the
maturity of the trichome composite on
[SPEAKER_01]: those buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last tool, this is the UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something going back to my
undergraduate and graduate school days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doubling chromosomes in plants is much
easier than animals, almost impossible in
[SPEAKER_01]: animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: In plants, you get double dosage of all
those genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You end up with larger cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in hemp, that gives you two things of
great value.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you larger seed and longer fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done this in the perennial grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest headache with pollen and
polyfloids, the chemical you use,
[SPEAKER_01]: or colchicine, inhibits mitosis or spindle
formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You end up with part of the meristem being
doubled and part not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You end up with chimeric or mixoploid
Frankenstein plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to determine if you truly have a
tetrafluid plant is the bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_01]: This technology has not improved in my
career.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either count chromosomes,
which is very laborious, or you can use a
[SPEAKER_01]: flow cytometer, which is simply a
capillary system using a laborer to
[SPEAKER_01]: reflect stained intercalated nuclei.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with hemp being a residence plant,
you can imagine what that resin does to
[SPEAKER_01]: the capillary tubing in those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's fraught with errors and it's
extremely time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our approach has been to develop a
microfluidic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agilent was next door in the expo hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our tools these days are becoming
miniaturized by simply going from
[SPEAKER_01]: capillary systems to microfluidics.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's done that yet with flow
cytometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with it with fluidic cells
you buy off the market or those you make
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself with 3D printers and some
imagination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same isolation of nuclei, microfluidic
separation, with or without electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works either way if you want to do
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And staining with your fluorochrome of
choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use ethidium bromide because it's
cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that case, it puts you in the UV range
for illumination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, this involves breadboards,
this involves coating, this involves a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of ingenuity that my students
didn't have time for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were faced with biological deadlines
and deliverable deadlines for contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had hundreds of plants we wanted to
screen for polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went back and used tools that had
been done previously looking at cell size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the cell, cell wall, are stomata.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diameter of that has been related to
polyploidy for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the advantage we have today,
we're much more precise with image
[SPEAKER_01]: classification and with digital
quantification of this versus our own
[SPEAKER_01]: visual eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing that, looking at stomata off of
lifts of epidermal cells and developing
[SPEAKER_01]: our models between diploids and
tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten very good at being able to
predict if these are going to be diploids
[SPEAKER_01]: or tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this allowed a student to look at 800
plants in a couple of weeks versus doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it at a flow cytometer and taking a couple
of months knocking a wood that everything
[SPEAKER_01]: works and nothing breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either one of these systems,
the microfluidic version or just the
[SPEAKER_01]: imaging version, could be great tools for
people that are in the business of looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at polyploid in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these products have been funded and
enabled by our research arm, Rare
[SPEAKER_01]: Genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their CEO is right there, their founders
are there and up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you to visit with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without them, my hemp program would be a
lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would still be much more of a perennial
grass breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have other tools as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, if I go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've enabled other work as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've developed things like terpium-based
insecticides that are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: disclosed very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've developed a huge germplasm
collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now have a suite of tetraploids,
of inbred lines, of synthetic hybrids in
[SPEAKER_01]: bulk populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a huge hemp germplasm
collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next year, we anticipate
disclosure on nanoparticles, nanocellulose
[SPEAKER_01]: and biocomposites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be a pretty good deck
they're going to have for IP around hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, I teach a class in hemp and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our department head who is also here
teaches a class in hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would love to teach more classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone here has interest in trying to
help us develop a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: curriculum or any other one that might be
of interest to you, I would love to visit
[SPEAKER_01]: and see if we can build it into some sort
of a combined curriculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're going to be doing.
We're going to be building it into a
class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can be undergraduate,
graduate, online, CEU, whatever you can
[SPEAKER_01]: envision.
[SPEAKER_01]: The student club I mentioned is here in
Forrest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its founder and president, Clay Moore,
is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have seen him around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit him with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our achievers, if you want to have
student involvement, please reach out to
[SPEAKER_01]: Clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, just turning back to the narrow
focus I tried to get to with these three
[SPEAKER_01]: tools that relate to medical cannabis,
that link is to a shared drive with one
[SPEAKER_01]: page of almost everything my program does,
most of the projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you'd like to visit with other
potential topics around this biorefinery
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, please feel free to reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know Ben's not up because I always
finish early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions are welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you saying that you were unsuccessful
with the flow cytometry to identify
[SPEAKER_02]: Ploydy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that a challenge to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The conventional flow cytometry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, the instruments are old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, the capillary tubing tends to get
plugged up by the cannabis resin,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it encourages mold growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're always trying to clean out and
disinfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spend more time disinfecting that
tubing in that system than actually
[SPEAKER_01]: running your samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just an inefficient process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the machine still costs 30 grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take a digital image of a
trichrome lift using super glue and a
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope slide of the epidermis and
classify that stomata, get the volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you have your comparison of
diploids and tetroloids, you'll know which
[SPEAKER_01]: class it's going to fall into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be a very simple digital
imaging solution versus that old clunky
[SPEAKER_01]: flow cytometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the flow cytometry used just,
you know, I didn't know if you were
[SPEAKER_02]: successful or if it was an efficiency
thing.
It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is torture for students?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, we're all students too,
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the ability to quantify the
degree of amber hue of trichomes was a
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting development and would
go a lot further than me having a Zoom
[SPEAKER_00]: call with one of our growers saying like,
well, how amber was it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that eyeball percentage?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious if you found any
correlation between that and concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD, dry matter development,
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're separate tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't tried to do any combined
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a beautiful question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were much further along with the NIR.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can use that very easily to quantify
the 3D animation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes and goes with student interest
and the transition to trying to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: 3D mesh is fairly recent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to relate that back to the
actual composition of the trichomes,
[SPEAKER_01]: we haven't done it yet, but you would
fully anticipate it would be as you would
[SPEAKER_01]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
Thank you.
