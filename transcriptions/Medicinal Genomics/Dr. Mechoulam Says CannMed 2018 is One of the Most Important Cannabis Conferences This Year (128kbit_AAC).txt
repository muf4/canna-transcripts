[SPEAKER_00]: Our knowledge of the effect of cannabis
and the use of cannabis is expanding all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning how cannabis works,
we're learning about the mechanism of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis work and we're learning how it
affects different states of disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: one type of disease, another type of
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to learn that and we have to
expand our knowledge all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad to learn that the meeting of
CanMed this year is going to do exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to tell us about the new things
that we have learned over the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years on cannabis use in medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you a few examples,
we published that cannabidiol is effective
[SPEAKER_00]: in several neurological diseases,
in particular epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many years ago, we published
actually a clinical paper on epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the use of cannabis or cannabidiol in
epilepsy was not taken over for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not allow this to happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should try to move from basic science
to clinical science as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, I hope, will be happening over
the next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that by having meetings like
CanMed will make possible this faster
[SPEAKER_00]: advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can just mention a few diseases that
I believe can be helped with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the moment they're not being used
to any extent because clinical trials are
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, diabetes type 1, which is an
autoimmune disease, namely the body
[SPEAKER_00]: attacks the cells that produce insulin and
the body doesn't have enough insulin and
[SPEAKER_00]: is sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we found in animals that cannabidiol
is very effective, but it has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: tried yet in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that it will be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a pretty good cure, I hope,
but we don't have the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example is schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 1% of the world population has
schizophrenia and it has been shown in
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials in this case that it
definitely is helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabidiol at very high doses is helpful
and yet it is not being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea why, but if we show in many
pre-clinical and clinical trials that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: useful, ultimately it will be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many, many other examples
and I believe that one of the ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: expand our knowledge, to put pressure when
needed so that cannabis or specific
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids like cannabidiol or THC by
having these meetings, we can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that CanMed 218 will be one
of the major, most important meetings in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area this year.
Thank you.
Thank you.
