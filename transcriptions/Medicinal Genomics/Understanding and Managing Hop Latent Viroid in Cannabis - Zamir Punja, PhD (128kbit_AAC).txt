[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the organizers for giving me
the opportunity to speak today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to shift gears a little bit
and get into the cultivation side of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you that perhaps don't
have any experience in seeing how cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: is grown, I think this will be a great
chance for you to learn the procedures.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more importantly, I'd like to talk
about a major threat to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, and that is a disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's called hoplite enviroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see some of the features and
characteristics of this particular disease
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eat your heart out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my work environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I spend two days a week in
the greenhouse looking at cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a greenhouse operation in British
Columbia, Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of the data that I'll present
today comes from an environment such as
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see a highly uniform well
sophisticated and hydroponically
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivated cannabis production,
which, of course, is the high THC or
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the pathogen or disease
hoplite enviroid can do to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: On your left is the stunted infected plant
that has hoplite enviroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on your right is the healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see right away that you've got
a significant reduction in growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which you'll see later correlates to a
reduction in the amount of cannabis flower
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as THC that comes out from these
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here again is a really nice comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Infected on your left, healthy plant on
your right, smaller leaves, darker leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: not as vigorous growing as what you would
expect in a plant that does not have this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly is hoplite enviroid?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a RNA molecule that exists in these
particular plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They happen to be the absolutely smallest
pathogenic organism that we know of,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is 50 micron nanometers,
which is one or five one hundredths of a
[SPEAKER_02]: micron.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so small that we can't even see it
other than with an electron microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pathogen that does occur on other
plant species such as potato and
[SPEAKER_02]: chrysanthemum, peach, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not affect humans or animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be restricted primarily to
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this point in time, I consider this
to be the COVID of the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see why in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was first reported in California
back in 2019, and plants there were
[SPEAKER_02]: stunted, not well developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flowers were not doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants were not rooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and the symptoms does vary depending
on what stage of the plant we're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll describe some of this as we go
through the presentation today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you see a plant that's in full
flower on the left hand side is the
[SPEAKER_02]: stunted plant that is obviously affected
by this hoplite enviroid produces much
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller flowers and overall yield has gone
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the pathogen will do when it
infects a plant and the inflorescences of
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers are developing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that the infected flowers are
much smaller and will produce much less
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you actually look at them side by
side, morphologically, they're no
[SPEAKER_02]: different other than the fact that they're
considerably smaller in size.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some genotypes or chemovars,
we do see a symptom such as this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost looks like a chrysanthemum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chrysanthemum type flower, the yellowing
that you see is not common.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not something that you'd like to
see in a cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're seeing a lower production of
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition, the roots are affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see they're healthy compared to
the infected root systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant isn't doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not growing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result, it's going to produce
less flower and less yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a really good comparison of how
the root systems have developed on these
[SPEAKER_02]: two plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers know that when they take cuts to
propagate cannabis, the cuts that come
[SPEAKER_02]: from infected plants do not root well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here again, what you're seeing is the
underside of a rooting block, the infected
[SPEAKER_02]: one on your left, the healthy one on the
right, very reduced root production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is quite an interesting pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It affects the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It affects the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It affects the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you'll see later on, it affects the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, when you have a plant that's
producing a poor root system, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to grow as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be obviously stunted,
and it's not going to be taking up as much
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients as it should.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition, I'll show you at the end
of the talk that these plants also seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: have increased susceptibility to other
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where the COVID analogy comes
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that suffer from COVID usually have
other disabilities or other issues that
[SPEAKER_02]: affect the liver or the heart or other
parts of the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: When these plants have hoplite and viroid,
they may also be reduced in their ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to fight off other diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's a really interesting slide
that compares one plant in which one side
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant has the hoplite and viroid,
which is the bottom side, and the top side
[SPEAKER_02]: is actually healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here, we can make a direct
side-by-side comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you look at the numbers, you'll see
where it says hoplite and negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: The THC concentration is 27.8,
and the terpene concentration is 1.3.
[SPEAKER_02]: You move down to the lower left,
where it says hoplite and positive,
[SPEAKER_02]: your THC concentration has dropped to
15.9%, almost a 40% reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your terpene levels have dropped to
1.1, about a 15% reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you that work in the industry
for medicinal or pharmacological use,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you have a plant that's infected with
hoplite and viroid, it's going to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: less cannabinoids, less THC, and less
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a very good comparison of what a
harvested plant will produce with regard
[SPEAKER_02]: to absolute yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once again, healthy on the left and
hoplite and infected on the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the smaller size overall,
way lower yield, way lower dry mass as a
[SPEAKER_02]: result of this particular pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the reason that the cannabinoids are
reduced is shown here in this schematic,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you have a nice, healthy trichome on
your left and a trichome that comes from a
[SPEAKER_02]: diseased plant on the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we see, and I'll show you this in
the next few slides, is a reduction in the
[SPEAKER_02]: size of the trichomes and in the volume of
material that they can produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because these trichomes are
primarily synthesizing cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, when you have a reduced shrunken
trichome, clearly that's going to impact
[SPEAKER_02]: what's being harvested from that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is using a scanning electron
microscope, where it says the healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: bracts comes from the flowers that are not
infected by this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over on the other side, where it says
infected, you can see overall that the
[SPEAKER_02]: little blobs, the trichomes are smaller,
and they're stunted in terms of how they
[SPEAKER_02]: develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's a close up again, where it says
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the trichome glands,
or the bulbs, where all these cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: that we heard about from Dr. Russo and
other speakers are contained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the bottom is the inflated trichome
gland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the infected plants, where the
trichomes are shriveled, much smaller in
[SPEAKER_02]: size, and obviously are going to produce
much less cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is why this disease,
this pathogen, is of such concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see this impact reduction in your
cannabinoids, it's clearly a cause for
[SPEAKER_02]: concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've collected some data on a number
of different strains or genotypes of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, and what this table is basically
showing you is how this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogen impacts plant height.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is the first column, the flower stem
length, the second column, flower fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: weight, the third column, and then finally
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see overall that the range of
reduction is anyway from 27 to 31% lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC is down 28.8% overall, varies by
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some strains that you see a 12%
reduction, and other strains almost a 40%
[SPEAKER_02]: reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they definitely appear to be a genotype
effect in terms of how these plants
[SPEAKER_02]: respond to this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in order to detect this particular
organism, this pathogen, we use what's
[SPEAKER_02]: called a PCR method, RT-PCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, very similar to what was developed
for analysis of COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you're seeing here is a gel,
and the bands, the white bands that you
[SPEAKER_02]: see, the multiple bands, indicate the
presence of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be showing you a number of these
slides that illustrate wherever you see
[SPEAKER_02]: the white bands, it tells you that the
hoplatin viroid is present in that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here what we've done is we've compared
a range of different types of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, different genotypes, and basically
what this is telling you is that hoplatin
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid was present in all of them using
these particular PCR primers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The arrow where it says root sample
indicates the presence of the viroid in
[SPEAKER_02]: the roots of the plants as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this becomes significant, as you'll
see in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how does this viroid spread?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, very similar to COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: It spreads through contact, through
handling of plants, through any tools or
[SPEAKER_02]: instruments that growers are going to be
using to take care of their plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also move through root contact,
and I'll indicate how that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can move through water, if there's
recycled water, that's being used in the
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, hoplatin viroid can be found.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if it's transmitted by
insects yet, and we do know that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: transmitted through seeds, and that's a
really important implication for the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this thing does really get around
extremely well through handling and
[SPEAKER_02]: through contact and through water and
through seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's an experiment we did where we
artificially introduced the hoplatin
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid using a cube.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cube tip that was dipped in
infected sap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lower panel shows you that after
you've introduced the viroid within two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, it can be detected, first of all,
in the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It moves from the upper stem into the
roots within a period of about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you come back and revisit
that plant at four weeks and six weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you find eventually is that the
entire plant is infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, what you're seeing on the lower
left, those bars indicate the presence of
[SPEAKER_02]: the viroid, and over on the right,
it indicates how this particular organism
[SPEAKER_02]: is spreading.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from the point of inoculation,
which was the top, it moves down into the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots, and then from there upwards into
the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that becomes really important from a
management perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what we know about hoplatin
viroid, is that it moves systemically
[SPEAKER_02]: inside the plant through tissues that are
called the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phloem is basically the plumbing
system in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you've got something in the
roots, the plumbing system will make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that that viroid moves up into the leaves
and, of course, into the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also conducted another experiment
where we placed an infected plant next to
[SPEAKER_02]: a healthy plant inside these cloners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we were trying to show here was
the spread of the viroid through water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two plants were not in contact with
one another, and the nutrient solution was
[SPEAKER_02]: being circulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lo and behold, the little plant that
you see on the left, which is marked
[SPEAKER_02]: infected, spread the viroid over to the
plant on the right, simply through water
[SPEAKER_02]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we demonstrated that, again,
using these two plants that are placed in
[SPEAKER_02]: a flat, the plant on the left was
infected, the plant on the right was not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We flooded water through those two plants,
and lo and behold, we had a 20%
[SPEAKER_02]: transmission rate from one plant to the
next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a common way that growers will
water their plants, is to flood them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea here now is that the viroid
could move quite readily through the
[SPEAKER_02]: watering system.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was an interesting experiment where
we took a bunch of clones, cuttings made
[SPEAKER_02]: from three infected mother plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, the roots are starting
to emerge on the bottom of the cuts at
[SPEAKER_02]: varying levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was really interesting was that in
each and every cut or clone that rooted,
[SPEAKER_02]: we found hoplatin viroid to be present,
and that's shown on the gel on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every sample had those white bands,
which indicates that the viroid was
[SPEAKER_02]: present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is another very important way by
which this pathogen moves, is through
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings, through cuttings that are made
from infected plants and are rooted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's just a summary.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you've got the viroid being
introduced into the roots, it'll spread
[SPEAKER_02]: upward into the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you some data in just a minute
that it gets into the flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: gets into the male flowers, it gets into
the female flowers, and it gets into the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that becomes real problematic
as far as how this disease may be
[SPEAKER_02]: distributed throughout the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We observed that when plants go into
flower, and those of you that may not be
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar, for cannabis to flower,
the photo period has to be switched from
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 hours of light to 12 hours of dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the minute you start to do that,
what we observed was that the
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration of the viroid started to
increase, and it started to move upward
[SPEAKER_02]: into the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're seeing here is a plant
that's on the left that is receiving full
[SPEAKER_02]: light, and on the right is the one that
goes into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you start looking for the viroid,
you see a dramatic increase, as you see
[SPEAKER_02]: with the presence of these white bands,
in the plants that are under 12 and 12
[SPEAKER_02]: photo period, which is the flowering
period, compared to the panel on the
[SPEAKER_02]: right, which received full daylight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think that the switching of the
plants from a vegetative stage into a
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering stage is causing that particular
viroid to move upward into the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know why just yet, but it's an
interesting and has implications for seed
[SPEAKER_02]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, when we analyzed dried hop
flowers that are out there in the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace, we went to 12 or 15 different
dispensaries, 40% of the dried flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: that we collected from dispensaries had
hoplatin viroid present in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as I mentioned, this is not a human
pathogen, so it's nothing that we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: be concerned about.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you need to be concerned about is the
fact that the presence of the viroid in
[SPEAKER_02]: those flowers is going to alter the
cannabinoids, the terpenes, and the ratios
[SPEAKER_02]: of those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that obviously has implications for
medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's an example of where we detected
hoplatin viroid in male flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Male flowers are used primarily just for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the panel on the right,
where we looked at floral tissues,
[SPEAKER_02]: anthers, and other parts of the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is data that we got from Toomey
Genomics, where they made crosses between
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that were positive for hoplatin
viroid and male plants that were negative
[SPEAKER_02]: for hoplatin viroid, and they did the
opposite across as well, where they took
[SPEAKER_02]: female plants that were negative for
hoplatin and crossed them with male plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that were positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they found when you do these
crosses is that you can find the viroid in
[SPEAKER_02]: the seed, on the seed, and on the seed
coat as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the data that they shared with
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The orange bars indicate the presence of
the viroid in seed, where the female plant
[SPEAKER_02]: was infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bars on the right show you the
presence of the viroid when the male plant
[SPEAKER_02]: was infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see, obviously, a higher
transmission when the female plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: infected, but also transmission when the
male plants are infected or as a source of
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you look at the actual numbers of
seed infection, it can be as high as 43%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty high transmission rate
through seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It varies a lot from plant to plant,
but that is indeed quite a significant
[SPEAKER_02]: observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good news is that there are
differences amongst cannabis chemo bars or
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes in response to this disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shows you the relative frequency of
infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bars indicate how much infection you
had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see with the lower bars,
the two arrows on the bottom, they seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: be some genotypes that have a better
ability to withstand this disease than
[SPEAKER_02]: others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good news for breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: We conducted an eradication program.
[SPEAKER_02]: An eradication program is where every
single plant that's infected is removed
[SPEAKER_02]: from a growing facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this bar graph is showing you,
this line graph, is the removal of plants
[SPEAKER_02]: from June of 2022 until January of 2023.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see rises in hoplite and viroid
infection, and you see declines in viroid
[SPEAKER_02]: infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the horizontal line or the line that's
pointing downwards indicates that
[SPEAKER_02]: eradication can work if it's done
successfully over a very long period of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single plant that's infected needs
to be removed from a growing facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is options for tissue culture as a
way to eliminate this particular viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I show here are two panels.
[SPEAKER_02]: The top panel is where you can use
Marystem culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the bottom panel is where you use nodal
stem culture to produce plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marystem culture is the preferred way in
order to try to obtain plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: free from this disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some things that are needed to
be resolved before tissue culture can be
[SPEAKER_02]: used.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants really need to be tested
rigorously to make sure that they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: contain the viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a possibility that Marystem
culture could be a way to eliminate this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: How well does this viroid survive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, again, it is quite a bit
like COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a slide that indicates it survives
on gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, it survives on gloves for up
to five days when the gloves are left at
[SPEAKER_02]: room temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It survives in leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, it survives in leaves for up
to four weeks, leaves that are left in the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also survives in various types of root
tissues, and I'll show you a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: slides that indicate that this viroid is
extremely stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is extremely stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, when you look at temperature,
this was where we took small root tissues
[SPEAKER_02]: that were infected by the viroid and
heated them up to 70 degrees centigrade
[SPEAKER_02]: for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The white bars, again, indicate the
presence of the viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even heating that tissue to 70 degrees for
30 minutes did not destroy the RNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example where we took UVC
light, UVC irradiation, and we exposed
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves and roots for five minutes,
long enough to cause a severe burn on your
[SPEAKER_02]: hand, and the viroid was still intact.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the bars are present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's UV stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more than that, it can tolerate things
like bleach and Xerotol and Virkon.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are chemicals that normally,
as disinfectants, would eliminate COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have absolutely no effect on this
particular viroid because of the stability
[SPEAKER_02]: of the RNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not to say that these chemicals
cannot be used in a cleanup operation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it indicates that neither of these
chemicals actually destroys the RNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the good news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to end the talk with a little bit
of hope because everything I've said so
[SPEAKER_02]: far indicates this thing is so stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nucleic acid enzymes, things that are
called nucleases, in particular,
[SPEAKER_02]: a particular type of nucleus that's called
RNase 3, will actually destroy the RNA of
[SPEAKER_02]: this viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here what you're seeing, the vertical
arrows, the blue arrows, indicate where we
[SPEAKER_02]: added the enzyme, the nucleases,
and it totally disrupted and destroyed the
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does this mean from practical
purposes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do know, though, is that there are
specific enzymes that could be used
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere on the line to actually destroy
this particular viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quickly, I'll show you how
hoplatin-viroid infected plants are more
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible to other diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a disease that's called Fusarium
oxysporum wilt, and you'll notice where it
[SPEAKER_02]: says hoplatin minus and hoplatin plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that has hoplatin viroid actually
picks up more Fusarium infection than the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that's not infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here you can see a very nice
comparison of two flowering stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one on the left with the white
mycelium is the plant that was infected
[SPEAKER_02]: with hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one on the right did not, and you can
see how much disease they develop as a
[SPEAKER_02]: result of the infection by the viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some data to illustrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue arrows basically tell you that
those are the lines in which Fusarium was
[SPEAKER_02]: increased as a result of the presence of
the hoplatin viroid, and that's of concern
[SPEAKER_02]: because it indicates that those plants may
be more susceptible to other pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, we looked at powdery mildew,
which is another important disease in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found again with powdery
mildew is that when you have hoplatin
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid present, you get more infection
with powdery mildew than you do when the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the graph on the bottom indicates the
green line is the infected plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the blue line is the plant that does
not have hoplatin viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is my last but one slide,
and I'll show you the really amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: contrast between a hoplatin infected plant
with powdery mildew and a hop negative
[SPEAKER_02]: plant with some powdery mildew,
but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, this is a predisposition to
other diseases that may be present in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there still are a number of unanswered
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can probably discuss those over the
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're almost out of time here,
but what is the basis for differences
[SPEAKER_02]: among cannabis chemovars or genotypes to
this disease?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not really sure yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we develop a screening method for this
pathogen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do plants that are growing in soil get
less viroid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything I showed you today was in
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a phenomenon called latent
infection in these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to understand more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly things like mycorrhizae,
will they protect plants from hoplatin?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll end here with an acknowledgement
to the research assistants and students
[SPEAKER_02]: that help you in the research,
as well as funding agencies and our
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborators and various government
agencies for providing funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you very much for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Samir.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very enlightening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard that some tissue culture labs
are not successful in eradicating HLV.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there tricks that you could indicate
to us to increase the success rate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it varies a lot from lab to
lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the key is to, first of all,
only obtain tissues from the tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture plant that you're going to use
that's at the very top of the meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that has to be done is the
plants that you use should not have high
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of the viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you need to try to
suppress the spread through whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanisms might be available,
whether it's through the use of antiviral
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals, or in some cases, some
researchers have stated plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: incubated under cold conditions will
actually have less replication of this
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you put the plants in cold,
you take only very small meristematic
[SPEAKER_02]: tissues, and then you really need to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to test, you need to test,
you need to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this viroid does stay latent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, similar to COVID, it's in your
body, but it doesn't manifest unless
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some stressful condition or some
environmental condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants need to be completely tested
well to make sure that they're clean
[SPEAKER_02]: before we actually release them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's definitely a lot of effort
going into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's going to be one of the
ways in which we can eradicate this
[SPEAKER_02]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the nucleus approach is not going to
replace meristem culture or anything else
[SPEAKER_02]: that the industry wants to look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be something right now
that's strictly hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_02]: The data, the slide that I showed you here
was actually taken about five days ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: where we wanted to run the experiment to
prove the concept that there are enzymes
[SPEAKER_02]: that will destroy the specific RNAs in
this virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you apply it, where you get it from,
how you use it is completely unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to genetically engineer a
plant to produce nucleases?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to insert nucleases into the
plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to use a bacterium to deliver
the nucleases?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know that yet, but all we do know
is that there is one approach that can
[SPEAKER_02]: hypothetically destroy this viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it could be something that's used as
a cleaning agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You apply it to the surface like you would
UV light and remove any viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you actually introduce that into the
plant is something that I think is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to still require a lot of conceptual
design and experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Punja, a very informative talk,
as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, there are some plants that are
capable of keeping the level of HLVD
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule at bay, particularly in the root
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems that there are some effective
defense mechanisms present in these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, I'm interested in genetic
resistance to diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you might have any
opinion about the nature of these defense
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question was, as I mentioned earlier,
there are plants or cultivars or chemovars
[SPEAKER_02]: that differ in their ability to withstand
this virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, very similar to humans and COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people get more of it, some people
get less of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only are now beginning to understand
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In plants, it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants can fight this thing off much
better than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are definitely genetic mechanisms
that determine that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not quite ready to get into that
yet, but Kevin McKernan from medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: genomics will speak after break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's going to talk about some
strategies that can be used from a genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective in the plant that will allow
us to mitigate the spread of this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to leave it with Kevin
because we haven't approached that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to leave this room with a
doom and gloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it is a very important
disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a severely important disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Kevin's going to talk more about the
genetic basis for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Zamir, thank you very much for your
research.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so I understood you, with the VirCon
as a 2% solution, is it still worthwhile
[SPEAKER_05]: to soak, say, pruning shears in the
solution prior?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that still a viable method for
cleaning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any sanitation approach that you take,
whether it's ethanol, bleach, or VirCon,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should still continue doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what I was trying to mention here
was that they don't destroy the RNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They aren't a curative.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're definitely worth protecting,
just like gloves, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wash your hands, wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That protects you, protects the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't eradicate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely, VirCon seems to be one of
the best products out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say bleach is also pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethanol, maybe not so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely dip the tools on the hands
on the surfaces, anywhere where the viroid
[SPEAKER_02]: can come into contact with the plant
surface.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a follow-up question, what percentage
of bleach would you advise?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't think you want to go
more than 10% because it's just so caustic
[SPEAKER_02]: to everything around you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the problem with bleach and the
smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20% would work better, but I would never
suggest you do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's one man, and maybe we can
do one before we go off for a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be around during break as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we need to break, we can certainly
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Dr. Poonja.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Bill Graham.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm with Microclone Tissue Culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked online.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to ask, we promote a cultural
program based on vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is taking tiny introduction cuts
from the tips of the very best veg plants
[SPEAKER_04]: every cycle to create the next generation
and cleaning the tools and everything in
[SPEAKER_04]: between.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the intent sort of to be to capture
those small pieces of tissue that would be
[SPEAKER_04]: viroid free for the circumstance that they
had just outgrown the viroid and to
[SPEAKER_04]: prevent that contamination.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems to be reducing the presence
in the entire population, even if it's
[SPEAKER_04]: just a few percent at a time over and
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so definitely a combined approach is
going to be extremely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So continuing to use the sanitation
products looking at the meristem tips for
[SPEAKER_02]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some growers will try to use the
uppermost part of the plant and use that
[SPEAKER_02]: as opposed to the bottom part.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we've seen from our data is that when
the viroid gets down into the roots,
[SPEAKER_02]: the first place it goes is actually up to
the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so taking those cuts for propagation
may not be the best idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for meristem growth, and for those of
you that are not familiar with meristems,
[SPEAKER_02]: the meristem is a very, very, very tiny
piece at the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea is that as the plant grows,
the viroid doesn't get all the way up into
[SPEAKER_02]: the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by harvesting that meristem,
you're one step ahead of the viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the theory behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got to be careful because I
think testing, testing, testing is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be super important.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be the next part we'll be talking
to you about the most strategic testing
[SPEAKER_04]: protocols.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, definitely RTPCR is going to be
the method of choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's out there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's many labs that actually
perform the diagnostic testing for hop
[SPEAKER_02]: laden.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant the wet tissue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk to you later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's follow up later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
