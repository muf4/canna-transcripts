[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I want to talk to you about
some of like, what are some of the common
[SPEAKER_00]: pests or problems that cannabis growers
just always seem to be dealing with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the four most common things
that I run into traveling the country are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be thrips, root aphids,
hoplite and viroid and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thrips can be kind of a problem because a
lot of times folks will only attack one
[SPEAKER_01]: life cycle stage of this infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thrips actually have a point where they
live in the canopy and they have a point
[SPEAKER_01]: where they live in the strata of your
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're not treating both,
you're going to see these ebbs and flows
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're gone for two weeks,
they come back, they're gone for two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks, they come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, educating growers that
doing a sprench application with thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: really does allow them to get ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root aphids are extremely hard to get rid
of just because they're incredibly adept
[SPEAKER_01]: at what people have been throwing at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've found to be the most effective
method to attack root aphids is to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually do an irrigation cycle before you
do any drenches or sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: They run away from that moisture of the
first irrigation cycle of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can get those pots wet and get them
complacent to the fact that that moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: is there, they're less apt to try to run
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whatever we're putting out via a
drench, sprench or spray is going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: much better likelihood of actually coming
in contact with them because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: just trying to run from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hoplite and viroid is something that a lot
of growers have it, but they don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: they have it until they have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this comes back to that
cultural practices thing and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of falls on everybody and just the
communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: That viroid can be transferred via dirty
matter, can be transferred mechanically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it grows from one plant to another,
doesn't wash his hands, can be spread by
[SPEAKER_01]: tools, it can be spread by runoff,
it can be spread by insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very prevalent pathogen and a lot
of folks don't take it as seriously as
[SPEAKER_01]: they should.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some grows that have completely
realized that it can decimate their
[SPEAKER_01]: business and they will test their moms
before they take cuts every single round
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're doing everything they need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are growers that still use
a single cup of Clonix and dip every
[SPEAKER_01]: single cut in that same hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like if there's any
contamination, you guys just spread it
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, honestly, I feel like the
viroids and pathogens are going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardest thing for the cannabis industry to
address because you don't know that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have them until you have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you have them, we can go into
remission, so to speak, we can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, get it to a point where the
plant can still finish, but those genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: are contaminated at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to keep them on board would be to,
you know, facilitate the downfall of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else that you have in your
stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, that can transfer so many
different ways and so easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that a lot of growers,
the latent portion of this viroid,
[SPEAKER_01]: if your plants are healthy, you're not
going to see what it can do right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, the plant health starts to
go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like cancer, you know,
that the patient isn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: bedridden when they're first diagnosed,
but the longer they are alive,
[SPEAKER_01]: that line goes like this, and the sicker
they become.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, to compromise an entire
business with HLV is just it's very scary
[SPEAKER_01]: because it will compromise your harvest,
your THC percentages plummet, your bag
[SPEAKER_01]: appeal goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the medicinal value of the plant is
just not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're basically growing hemp at
that point, like you're compliant with the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm bill almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought of it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last, you know, most common pathogen
that I see is powdery mildew just because
[SPEAKER_01]: it is very prevalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times growers won't do everything
they need to do to eliminate said issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is something that can be gotten rid
of fairly easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing I always tell people is make
sure your environment's on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't set your temp to 60 and your
dehu to 10 and then hit those numbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: your environment isn't where it needs to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are folks that say,
oh, I can get it to where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't hit those parameters,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the first thing growers have to do
is make sure that their HVAC is up to
[SPEAKER_01]: point, their air conditioning is up to
point, their dehu is where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're still experiencing powdery
mildew, that's when we say, OK,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's look at what we can spray to
basically kind of hinder this thing in its
[SPEAKER_01]: tracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got some really cool options for
cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have very safe application methods
and zero residual aspects in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just allows them to basically get
on that schedule of like, OK, it's flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to spray oxyphos and xeritol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's Wednesday, we got to hit a
mycoinsecticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to touch on what you kind of said
earlier, in my program, Monday,
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesday, Friday for preventative is
spray days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuesday and Thursday is plant work and
scavenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we get from basically
curative into preventative, I'm sorry I
[SPEAKER_01]: said that wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said preventative, but I meant curative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we get into the preventative mode,
we actually flip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
we're doing scouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuesday, Thursday, we're doing our sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea is that you are in there
looking at the plants as much as you're
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying or defoliating or doing anything
else because we have to evaluate our
[SPEAKER_01]: progress and keep a lot of logs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't write down what we're doing in
a month, we won't remember what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if we did anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, grows are very cyclical in terms
of what happened last June.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likely is going to happen this June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can go back to your log last
year and say, shit, we had thrips on the
[SPEAKER_01]: 14th when it got really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look at your calendar and you
say, OK, it's going to get up to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 102 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm anticipating thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put out your ambicelius,
cucumeris, you know, beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_01]: and later flower and then do your sprays
in your veg and your prop and your early
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and combat the thrips before they
ever even get established.
