[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, thanks for having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Medicinal Genomics for putting
this on, and really thanks for just taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great conference, great speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm here to talk to you about today
is growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a small production company based
out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in business for about four
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother and I co-founded it in 2015,
and this past season was sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: culmination of a lot of the research and
development that we've been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: over that four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That resulted in about 4,000 acres of
production across the United States for
[SPEAKER_00]: phytocannabinoid rich CBD hemp,
roughly 15 million pounds of biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: testing at around 10% on whole plant
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm here to talk to you about is a
little bit of the behind the scenes of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we do and how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I do want to just say thanks to
Medicinal Genomics, Orange Photonics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Pixis Laboratories in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of these companies have
radically changed the way that we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: go about the plant breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have markedly accelerated what we can
do and how quickly we can bring true F1
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids to the market for farmers to
produce with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be remiss if I did not thank
everybody on my staff at Oregon CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day is Monday, Monday 1,
Monday 2, Monday 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working tirelessly for the last
four years to be able to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: phytocannabinoids, non-psychoactive
cannabinoids could be accessed by
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in the country, everybody in the
world at a reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk a little bit more about how
that's come about.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to think about cannabis
legalization in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: we essentially have three separate
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is actually I have a PhD in
sociology.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research was on the political economy
of cannabis and the way that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: unfolding in 2013 and 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to think about this is that we
essentially have three channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is the adult use, medical use,
recreational, however you wanna describe
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's THC dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a high regulatory burden,
seed to sale tracking, testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the downside of that is that you're
looking at a fairly small user base,
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere between 15 to 20% of the
population at any given time is consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other cannabinoids that are
obviously being used, but that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: predominant cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about that too,
and this is something that came out of my
[SPEAKER_00]: research, is that the total US demand for
THC can be met on about 6,000 acres if
[SPEAKER_00]: produced right in southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a small market relative to the
non-psychoactives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easily captureable by folks with
a lot of capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other aspect of this is the
pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've obviously heard a lot about
different compounds that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: developed and trialed and that are coming
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic, we love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the user base in this situation
is determined in part by the FDA and
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies as well as the applicability of
each one of these very specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds for specific treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like industrial hemp, at least from our
perspective, one, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: non-psychoactive, two, there was a very
low regulatory burden getting into this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the user base is pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about all vertebrates and
according to some of the research,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some invertebrates as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure how we're gonna capitalize
on that financially, but it's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real quick, hemp and marijuana,
in the United States, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation between them with hemp
being anything below 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is obviously an arbitrary,
socially constructed limit that dates back
[SPEAKER_00]: to Small and Cronquist, a publication from
some Canadian scientists in 1976 that were
[SPEAKER_00]: examining new leaf tissues on mature
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, that's not necessarily the best
way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we have better tools to assess what
the differences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And truly, when you look at the
literature, it says, most of the genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: data and literature on cannabis at this
point says it's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just two very closely linked
genes, eight centimorgans apart on the
[SPEAKER_00]: same chromosome that differentiate between
these different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you step back and you look at this from
a perspective from a producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're interested in trying to have large
plant numbers to be able to do targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs and develop new unique
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's not type one or type two
is essentially fair game if you jump into
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the passage of the 2014 Farm
Bill, we all had the opportunity to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the originating question that really
drove our research was, how can we make
[SPEAKER_00]: non psychoactive cannabinoids both
available and affordable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Picture of my trail running buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2014, he was about 11 years old,
hips were hurting, he was suffering from
[SPEAKER_00]: occasional seizures, and I found that CBD
really was an effective treatment for him,
[SPEAKER_00]: helped out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem was, is it was about $2,500 a
pound wholesale when THC was about $2,200
[SPEAKER_00]: a pound wholesale at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seemed ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to try to figure out how to
alleviate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal was to essentially replicate
what's already been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is no secret, most of us are all
doing the same thing that somebody's done
[SPEAKER_00]: before, hate to burst everyone's bubble,
but we did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to replicate Horta Farm and GW
Pharma's single cannabinoid chemotype
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But importantly, we were not focused on
just developing individual clones for
[SPEAKER_00]: production in sealed warehouses or
greenhouses or et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really wanted to be able to produce
true F1 100% female plant varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be deployed across the country with
small farmers being able to produce these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also needed to address some of the big
issues that come along with large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: production, namely harvesting and drying
either using mechanization or using nature
[SPEAKER_00]: when at all possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That required that we'd have to develop
independent lines based on photoperiod
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that included day neutral plants,
which are considered auto flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: early flowering plants, which is something
that we actually invented, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_00]: invented again following in other people's
footsteps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are plants that start flowering
shortly after the peak in June of sunshine
[SPEAKER_00]: and essentially finish up in the month of
September in most locations across the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, as well as what most people
are accustomed to, which is we call it a
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional long season plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the in depth breeding program that
we operate at our facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this requires in terms of being
able to develop individual true breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: F1 lines is you start off with two
completely unrelated, very distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: parental lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cross those two plants, depending on
what your goals are, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype switch or increasing cannabinoid
content or creating structural differences
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You inbreed those, excuse me, you cross
those and create your F1 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, we isolate each one of those
F1s that come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally this is, you don't need a
very large sample size when you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we go down to 20 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbreed each one of those, collect the
seeds off of those using a self
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization technique described by Ram
and Set in 1982 using silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resulting seeds that come off of those
plants are again, isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spend our summers growing out F2s,
which is sort of where unicorns emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a common thing that folks are
looking for in the plant breeding world
[SPEAKER_00]: where they are just absolute masterpieces
of recombination, taking the best of both
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the parents, both of the P1 and
the P2 and creating something unique,
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse and new.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, to be able to isolate and lock
in those traits, we continue to inbreed
[SPEAKER_00]: generation after generation after
generation in isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest challenges that we run
into, especially on the hemp side,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that infertility tends to set in fairly
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, we average about F4,
the F4 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a third round of selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically attempting to reduce
heterozygosity, make the plants as true
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding as possible so that when we do
end up eventually out crossing it to
[SPEAKER_00]: create our F1 hybrids, that you end up
with high levels of uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just to highlight, on the left
you're seeing the development of one line
[SPEAKER_00]: and that arrow pointing to the circle is
another independent line that has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: developed just to make each one of these
F1 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we've isolated these plants,
before we release it to farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we run progeny trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a number of different varieties
that came out of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cross it out to our pollen donor and
then we run our trials to figure out which
[SPEAKER_00]: of these plants are most stable when out
crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, we usually come down to one or
two plants and those plants are lucky
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to get put into our breeding
programs, mass propagated and end up
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in producing seed for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The take home message on this is,
one, if you're a plant breeder and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really looking for something unique,
F2 is where it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just incredible things that pop up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very different approach from what
we end up seeing in traditional cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're crossing two usually
polyhybrid varieties that end up not being
[SPEAKER_00]: true breeding when you try to put them in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But large scale field production requires
a very different approach and it's only
[SPEAKER_00]: solved with true F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've been able to do with the help
of these analytical testing companies and
[SPEAKER_00]: this breeding process is essentially be
able to create new varieties in anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 18 to 24 months depending on
chemotype or the specific terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We end up with very vigorous, very
uniform, structurally stable dense,
[SPEAKER_00]: high yielding, just beautiful flowers that
are perfect for farmers who just need to
[SPEAKER_00]: put plants in the ground and figure out
how to harvest them to get them to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The really cool part about this is that
we've actually been able to achieve 99.97%
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants in these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially one in 4,000 plants ends
up having a male phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have two X chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really female, but they have a
male phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let them pollinate plants,
50% of the following progeny will end up
[SPEAKER_00]: having that male phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're problematic, need to be removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on trying to get it to 100%,
but at this point, 99.97% we think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I just mentioned, our CBD lines,
this is basically a three to four year
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our first lines in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: We outcrossed those using the schema that
I showed before and we've conducted field
[SPEAKER_00]: trials in 2016 and 2017 before releasing
those to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we had over 4,000 acres in
production in industrial hemp legal states
[SPEAKER_00]: across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yields ranged anywhere between 2,000 to
8,000 pounds per acre and you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at a content of 8 to 12% on biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the outliers for all of the
varieties that we developed are well over
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% on total CBDA content on trim flower
tops, which is basically we've taken
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp and turned it into the
phytocannabinoid rich THC cultivars with
[SPEAKER_00]: great terpenes and great structure that
everybody loves, but you can produce them
[SPEAKER_00]: in a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shots of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shot on the left is a 1,500 acre farm
in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same shot on the right, just a close up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in seeing more
pictures of this, we had a photo contest
[SPEAKER_00]: on Instagram, hashtag best Oregon CBD
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely beautiful results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great plants and really the farmers
made us look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the goal is to be able to
isolate and put into production other
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next target was CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found our first pure CBG line in the
first quarter of 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant was about 9.5% CBG,
less than 0.1% THC, non detectable CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it had a 100 to 1 ratio for CBG to
THC, which when you're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp laws in the farm bill in
the United States, 0.3% means that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could actually run up to 30% CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a trim flower and still be legal for
interstate commerce in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have improved these lines over the last
year and a half, and we conducted large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale field trials this past season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is no sleight of hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people for some reason think that
when you have a high level of CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's because the plant was harvested early
or you did some sort of magic with the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just full term plants that
happen to have THC turned completely off
[SPEAKER_00]: just through a random mutation that we
happen to find, the needle in the
[SPEAKER_00]: haystack, and a regular non functional CBD
allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this particular plant tested at 18.9%
CBG, that's on a trim flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see the THC content on
that is way below the 0.3% requirement to
[SPEAKER_00]: be federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of this too is once you start
inbreeding plants, another tip if you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: F2 is where the magic happens,
but inbreeding is where you can really
[SPEAKER_00]: lock in and find incredible results.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the inbreeding on our CBG lines,
we're able to attain right now that the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest level that we've seen is 480 to
one ratios of CBG to THC, which means that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make oil, in this case,
40% CBG rosin and still be below the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal limit of 0.3% on THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also discovered CBC rich plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBC rich plants are a little bit more
difficult in that there is a linkage
[SPEAKER_00]: between cannabinoid content, total
cannabinoid content production,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the CBC gene for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't been able to get over about
5% total cannabinoid content on those
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, but they are CBC rich anywhere
between 20 to 30% of the total cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be better ways of going about
producing CBC, which would be maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: isolating it in CBD lines or in CBG lines,
but we're working to improve that and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll have field trials out in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just some analytical data to back
that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing that we discovered this
past summer, in part because I do like
[SPEAKER_00]: beer and I like the hops industry,
but I feel bad for hops growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't look like much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discovered cannabinoid free plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is literature that describes the
functional mechanisms that make this
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's upstream of CBG production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically just turning off some of
the precursor chemicals and the plant only
[SPEAKER_00]: bioaccumulates terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at the plant, it looks
resinous, it looks greasy, it smells
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found this and when you look at the
literature, it suggests that it takes two
[SPEAKER_00]: generations so you can out cross to any
flavor that you're interested in,
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel, et cetera, et cetera,
and within two generations, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: identify plants that have that same
terpene profile, but no cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about it because it's
more agronomically efficient than hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't suffer from many of the same
diseases, in part because we are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed and they do contain more oil on
average in the same terpene combinations
[SPEAKER_00]: as some of the traditional hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very excited to be able to work
with the brewing industry and being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring these to fruition and put them in
beers here shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just to back that up,
no cannabinoids and the raw chromatogram
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything on the left hand side of that one
minute mark, I was told by Pixis Labs that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was just something caught in their
HPLC machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close up picture of these cannabinoid free
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the trichomes, they're covered,
obviously covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look very resinous, but the trichome
heads are much, much smaller in size than
[SPEAKER_00]: we see with other plant lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last little bit here, we have discovered
multiple THCV, CBDV and CBGV lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are lines that do not have any
of the propols as the dominant fraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: but through inbreeding, we are working to
improve those and have heightened
[SPEAKER_00]: expression ready throughout the rest of
this year and into 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Field production is slated for field
trials for 2020 and we hope to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities out to farmers everywhere
across the country in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea behind this is we know what's
going to happen with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is an easy to monopolize market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna end up with, just like the
alcohol industry, several very large
[SPEAKER_00]: companies dominating production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can continue to make each one of
these novel non psychoactive cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: available for farmers to be able to
produce, we have a chance to at least keep
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the culture and some of the
approaches that we had in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry leading up to legalization alive
and well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking ahead for 2019,
we thought that CBD was probably gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: wash out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already got contracts in place for
over 15,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost a four fold increase over what
was produced this year using our seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking to increase our capacity
up to about 50,000 acres by the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned at the very
beginning, $2,500 pounds to get non
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive cannabis to make my dogs hips
feel better just seems wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, we're down to anywhere between
$25 to $50 a pound for equivalent biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's over the course of four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not necessarily great for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for consumers and people that
benefit from non psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we anticipate that this is going to
continue forward as time goes on and we
[SPEAKER_00]: get better plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
