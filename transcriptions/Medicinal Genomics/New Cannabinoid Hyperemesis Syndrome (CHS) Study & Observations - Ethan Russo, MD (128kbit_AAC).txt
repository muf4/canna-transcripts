[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so between 2004 and the present,
there wasn't a lot of explanation of what
[SPEAKER_00]: CHS was from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there have been, again, studies that
showed that marked up regulation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothalamic pituitary system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically stress responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you bet, if you're in pain and you're
nauseated and vomiting, you got stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, this is really serious stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't, you know, simple situation of
vomiting a couple of times because of a
[SPEAKER_00]: virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: People lose weight, they get marked
abnormalities, sometimes of electrolytes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the mineral balance in the
blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've actually been two deaths
attributed to this because of how bad the
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting was from CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there are certain markers,
but until recently, we didn't have an
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does one person get it and another one
doesn't?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the reason we wanted to examine
it with the hypothesis that perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: certain people have a genetic
susceptibility to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we wanted to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with Endocanna Health, we put together
a study starting with a survey,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, of over 500 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, for entry as a CHS patient,
we had very strict criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want there to be mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing was they had to carry a
diagnosis of CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, somebody had seen them and
said that this wasn't what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then additionally, they had to have active
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want people in that may have
been misdiagnosed as having CHS,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're okay now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, they didn't really have
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that whittled things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it down to something like 200
candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were offered genetic testing,
which is done with a swab in the mouth to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there was a lot of
attrition between step two and step three
[SPEAKER_00]: because only 28 CHS confirmed CHS patients
returned the kit after all of them had
[SPEAKER_00]: said that they wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that was we had a great
deal of pushback from the CHS online
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people that questioned our
motives, thought we were in this for the
[SPEAKER_00]: money, didn't like our methodology for one
reason or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was an active movement to
tell people not to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that wasn't helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we needed to compare them to
somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were some people who took the
survey that were high volume cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, about the same,
four grams a day, who didn't have CHS
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms and didn't have a diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were the comparison groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was a little surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first hypothesis was, well,
there's gotta be a problem with the CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, the gene that codes for the CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned previously, you do see that
in cyclic vomiting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instantly we had a difference between
the two syndromes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also hypothesized two other things,
that it could be a problem with the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism of THC, how it's broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did get confirmation of that because
there was a statistically significant
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in a mutation in a CYP2C9 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between the CHS patients and the heavy
usage of cannabis that didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CYP2C9 is the enzyme in the liver that
breaks down THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might understand if there were a
mutation there, perhaps that it wasn't as
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient breaking down THC, that levels
would be higher and this could produce
[SPEAKER_00]: this funny reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third hypothesis that we had was that
there would be an issue with the TRPV1,
[SPEAKER_00]: TRPV1 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought of that because one of the
interesting things about CHS is that hot
[SPEAKER_00]: water exposure seems to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, something else that's
hot, application of capsaicin ointment on
[SPEAKER_00]: the skin, the active ingredient in
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chili peppers also temporarily relieve
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That turned out to be the case too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we saw a statistically significant
difference in the number of mutations seen
[SPEAKER_00]: in the CHS patients in the TRPV1 gene as
compared to the high volume cannabis users
[SPEAKER_00]: without CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then there were a couple of things we
hadn't hypothesized.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two genes related to dopamine
metabolism with abnormalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was for the gene that codes the
dopamine type two receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interesting receptor in that
it's the target for anti-psychotic drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people have a mutation there,
as we saw in the CHS patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're at risk for a whole bunch of
things, addiction to other substances,
[SPEAKER_00]: also risk for psychosis and other
psychiatric issues to a strong degree,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be depression, anxiety,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also a mutation in what's called
the COMT, catecholomethyltransferase gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the gene that breaks down
dopamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if there were a problem there,
you might get a buildup of dopamine that
[SPEAKER_00]: would provoke addictive behavior or that
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was one, that made sense
though, because all of what we've
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned so far sort of, it informs the
symptomatology and phenomenology of CHS,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that it helps explain some of the
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: TRPV1 among other things has to do with
propulsion in the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If things aren't moving, you'll tend to
vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is in the brain and is associated
with anxiety and pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things begin to make a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fifth mutation that we saw was
something we had not expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a gene called ABCA1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with cholesterol metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's a little ominous because
people who have mutations on this gene may
[SPEAKER_00]: be susceptible to a number of problems
later in life, specifically coronary
[SPEAKER_00]: artery disease, type two diabetes
mellitus, and Alzheimer disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do not know yet because this hasn't
been around yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are folks with CHS that have this mutation
at greater risk for these disorders?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is quite possibly yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this takes on another dimension of
public health relevance that we really
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be examining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for joining us.
