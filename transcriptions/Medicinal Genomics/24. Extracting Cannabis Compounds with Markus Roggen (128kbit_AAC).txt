[SPEAKER_00]: Community on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, I had the pleasure of
discussing the chemistry of cannabis with
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Marcus Roggen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In his various roles and positions,
Marcus oversaw multiple teams that are
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on the whole processing flow of
cannabis production from harvest and
[SPEAKER_00]: drying through processing and extraction,
all the way to the formulation and quality
[SPEAKER_00]: control analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The topics we discussed include the number
of compounds that have been identified in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis plant and whether there are
more to be found, the complexity of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis compared to other plants and
herbs, the challenges with the entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, could there be invisible compounds
that are responsible for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic effects, how different storage
conditions and extraction techniques will
[SPEAKER_00]: yield different chemical compounds,
and why the term whole plant extract is a
[SPEAKER_00]: misnomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get to that conversation,
I do want to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cannabis Chemistry Subdivision of the
American Chemical Society, also known as
[SPEAKER_00]: CAN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2015, CAN has been building a strong
network of scientists in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: space to promote scientific innovation,
safety, and the development through
[SPEAKER_00]: education, research, and the empowerment
of the scientific community.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more about what CAN has to offer,
please visit their website at www.cann-acs
[SPEAKER_00]: .org.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, our friends at the Hemp and
Coffee Exchange are creating some great
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't know, hemp coffee is
healthy, delicious, and a natural product
[SPEAKER_00]: rich in trace minerals and nutrients,
providing sustained energy without the
[SPEAKER_00]: crash of regular coffee.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus Roggen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to talk with you today because
I know that your area of expertise is
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't had an extraction expert on the
podcast yet, so I'm excited to talk with
[SPEAKER_00]: you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because you are our first extraction
expert, I was hoping we could start with
[SPEAKER_00]: the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could you explain the general concept
of extracting compounds from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's nice to be called an extraction
expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a chemist by background,
actually an organic chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I learned how to make molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the cannabis industry,
I found my niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: And extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that we can speak about some of the
other topics that we're working on as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extraction in the cannabis industry comes
from the desire of turning the good part
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis, and good is a discussion we
can have in a moment, into other products
[SPEAKER_02]: than just joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then comes the question, how do you
remove the cannabinoids, the good part,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to say, from the rest of the material
of the plant that you don't want,
[SPEAKER_02]: like cell walls, chlorophyll, fats and
waxes, as they like to be called,
[SPEAKER_02]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do that in various,
or there might be various forms to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And extraction is the common and most
efficient way to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So extraction in the chemical sense means
you are dissolving compounds of interest
[SPEAKER_02]: in your solvent or in a liquid,
and remove them from the matrix or the
[SPEAKER_02]: undesirable aspect of your material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might also help to think about what
extraction is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kefing, ice water hash, and Rasenpress
is not an extraction because that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanical manipulation, either by
pressure or mechanical agitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not using a solvent to pull out the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So extraction would therefore be CO2
extraction, butane, or alcohol extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are the benefits of using a
solvent versus doing sort of those
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical operations like you had just
mentioned?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so in a mechanical operation,
you have very little selectivity or
[SPEAKER_02]: specificity of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are just hoping that you can break off
the compounds you like and leave behind
[SPEAKER_02]: what you don't like, and then somehow
separate them through a filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that works quite nicely with cannabis
because most of the cannabinoids are in
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes and they are smaller than the
leaves, so you could filter them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you use a solvent for extraction,
you can choose your solvent specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: to do the job you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pick a solvent that dissolves your
compound of interest, but does not
[SPEAKER_02]: dissolve the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there isn't water extraction of
cannabis because cannabinoids do not
[SPEAKER_02]: dissolve in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one picked another solvent,
and there comes butane, a very apolar
[SPEAKER_02]: solvent, aliphatic solvent that is very
good in dissolving terpenes and pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: good in dissolving cannabinoids,
but not good or not at all compatible in
[SPEAKER_02]: dissolving water or other very powerful
polar compounds in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then ethanol, again, very,
very good in dissolving cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: good in dissolving terpenes, but because
it is a polar solvent, can also dissolve
[SPEAKER_02]: other compounds that might not be
desirable, like sugar, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: sugars can dissolve in ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then CO2 is a more varied solvent
where you can try to play with compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions to change its solvent
capabilities, fine tune for different
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, extraction allows you to
pick a solvent and pick extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions to target your compounds of
interest and leave behind what you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like different solvents are
good for different parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about really being
selective of which one that you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a bit of a trade off game in terms
of which solvent you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is always the trade off game.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, and it's getting better in the
last few years, but I've been now in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I started in 2014, which makes me
ancient in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although there were a lot of grades before
me and they're still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the cannabis industry, what often
happened was you pick the solvent and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you build your operation around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was either because of beliefs,
public interest, or regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my start in extraction in a company
that was in an area where the only solvent
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed was CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I became an expert in CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not because CO2 was what I picked
initially, it was just forced up on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can also say, oh, butane is the
one that gives you the best flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people pick butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a better approach, which, as I said,
is slowly now taking over the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: one should consider the inputs and the
outputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for outputs is what is the product you
desire to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are making CBD isolate,
you just need the highest recovery of CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: and the fastest, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't think about further precision
because you will purify afterwards anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just turn through a lot of material.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're thinking about vape cartridges,
you're now thinking, okay, how do I
[SPEAKER_02]: customize my solvent system to make the
product that I want?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are also inhalables or
dabbleable products which have other
[SPEAKER_02]: product requirements or ingredients for
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then on the other hand, you also have
the inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what materials do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you only have 20 kilos of cannabis
flower from an indoor grower every month
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have to go through?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you have 200 acres of hemp where you
have one harvest in autumn and you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: run through that very quickly?
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these aspects, you have to balance
to find the best system for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious with that latter example,
if you did have sort of this one large
[SPEAKER_00]: batch, one large harvest, would the
strategy be to pick one method and go
[SPEAKER_00]: through it all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or could you have multiple different
methods that kind of target different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds within that harvest and then you
can kind of join them together after the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact?
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you mean splitting the harvest into
three product streams or going through
[SPEAKER_02]: three consecutive extractions with three
different solvents for all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: material?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was more thinking to split it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like say, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So splitting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So splitting up might actually be a good
idea because you have to balance speed,
[SPEAKER_02]: precision and just business economics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you build an extraction
facility that can handle all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest within a month, you have a
facility that doesn't do anything for 11
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a very, very expensive facility
that doesn't do much work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't actually want to have the
opportunity or if you could build a
[SPEAKER_02]: facility very, very cheap that can handle
that size, then that might be an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you take a really, really big bucket
of ethanol, you could extract the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest in one dip and a bucket isn't that
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, maybe you split it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would have something that goes
through some of your material very quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: like ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have something that handles
non-dried material well so that you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh harvested and directly do the
extraction without having to invest in
[SPEAKER_02]: drying capacity, which would be a butane
or hydrocarbon extraction system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could consider of having a
CO2 set up which would target to get
[SPEAKER_02]: through its allotted material over the
course of a whole year so that your very
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive instrumentation of CO2 doesn't
need to be so large that no one can
[SPEAKER_02]: finance that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that would allow you to have constant
production of material to a certain level
[SPEAKER_02]: of precision.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, it would be a very interesting
setup and I would like to help with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there comes something else into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question of drying and preservation of
cannabis or hemp material for extended
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where my general research
interest didn't stop just at extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a chemist, I was thinking what else is
chemistry related in cannabis that is
[SPEAKER_02]: attached or influenced by extraction?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have been doing research into
drying and curing and storage of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: with different drying or freezing methods,
storage under various gases to affect
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes and cannabinoid consistency over
time so that they are either quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: handled or safely stored for extended time
so that they could then go into the stream
[SPEAKER_02]: of CO2 extraction half a year after
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it sounds like there's a lot
of different methods to do extraction and
[SPEAKER_00]: then of course there's a lot of different
compounds in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible to really get a full
spectrum extraction or tincture or is that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a misnomer?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned, I just said good,
something good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can discuss about good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also have to discuss about the
question what is full spectrum?
[SPEAKER_02]: If full spectrum means everything of the
cannabis plant, you can't use an extract
[SPEAKER_02]: because by definition you left something
behind, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no chlorophyll, there aren't any
leaves, there are no cell walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can't be full spectrum because that
is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you now define full spectrum as all
of the cannabinoids and all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you test for those, but you don't
test for all cannabinoids and all
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what about flavonoids and sugars and
carotenes?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that those are around and they
might have some value, flavor or medical
[SPEAKER_02]: or both.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you define full spectrum?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is full spectrum due just as the
opposite of isolated?
[SPEAKER_02]: So full spectrum is not CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although when you want to separate
yourself from a full spectrum from
[SPEAKER_02]: anything isolated, one of the most common
method to isolate is distillation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can you have a full spectrum
distillate?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy full spectrum distillates on
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an oxymoron.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pitched the question back to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is full spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I guess I can't define that,
but I know that at least the reason why
[SPEAKER_00]: people are interested in full spectrum is
this whole idea of the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That there are multiple compounds within
the cannabis plant that are in some
[SPEAKER_00]: combination contributing to this medicinal
effect that so many people benefit from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the reason why people
are so interested in full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does that involve?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to throw that back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that you've done a lot of
work in cataloging the various compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that are within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we know so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that's a multi-step answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an entourage answer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple aspects work together to give the
full picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, I'm a chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a medical or biological biology
practitioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't actually know what molecules do
with the human body.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just ensure that those molecules are
there or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I then don't know what the effect is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, I understand the public perception
of entourage means there are multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That act either together or independently
on various systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these overall activity in the
body leads to the desired effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But another explanation I could have for
entourage effect is similar to the full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something works.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't know which one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might be a minor cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That no one tests for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just super active that we only
see THC in it as the main ingredient.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this low concentration other
cannabinoid actually does all the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And work by Professor Mary, who you had on
the show, does point to that
[SPEAKER_02]: interpretation in its particular area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's either multiple compounds do
multiple things, or it is one compound
[SPEAKER_02]: that no one tests for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that does all the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying which one is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I leave that to the experts in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although if you want to find that one that
does all the work, I might be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: help, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can find stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the next question is, which compounds
are there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that then comes to another interest
that came out of our research push that we
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to cite is to somehow catalog and
have a centralized, verified, trustable
[SPEAKER_02]: source that gives all the compounds that
are in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start Googling information for
cannabinoids, you often fall onto websites
[SPEAKER_02]: like Reddit, Leafly, Wikipedia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those information are dispersed,
you can't really find all the information
[SPEAKER_02]: you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of or many of the information is
wrongly repeated.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I see a lot is the
melting, the boiling point of THC being
[SPEAKER_02]: 155 degrees, which is correct based on the
primary literature where that was
[SPEAKER_02]: characterized.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is in the primary literature,
I think it was paper by Mechelam,
[SPEAKER_02]: it actually says it's 155 to 157 degrees
Celsius at reduced pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the distillation under vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you only give the temperature and
not the pressure, everyone assumes that
[SPEAKER_02]: room pressure and you wonder why it never
boils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you would translate that into
room pressure conditions, it would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: boiling point of 425 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm even wondering if at that point
THC just decomposes and just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by having incomplete and imprecise and
often wrong information interdispersed
[SPEAKER_02]: through the web, we thought it would be
useful to try to build a database that
[SPEAKER_02]: tracks all compounds that are known to the
cannabis plant and have them in one
[SPEAKER_02]: database.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started that in-house so that we could
just do our research better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But later we thought it might be of
interest to other people outside of our
[SPEAKER_02]: company and so we built a website for it
that then allows everyone to search
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the database is incomplete.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are always new compounds found and
not all physical and chemical aspects of
[SPEAKER_02]: the compounds are known because they might
have only been identified in small
[SPEAKER_02]: quantities so that no one really measured.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're trying to add to that with
literature that we find with research from
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborators and our own research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over time, this database will just
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the next upgrade we are
planning, so we initially had all the
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had them in categories like
cannabinoids and terpenes and flavonoids
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we added physical aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could find melting point, boiling
point, viscosity, density, and so on and
[SPEAKER_02]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we are looking at adding
spectroscopical data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the right LC or GC method to
look for the compounds?
[SPEAKER_02]: At what time would they elude?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does an NMR or an IR spectra look of
those compounds?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that then either allows you to build
your own methods to look for the compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: or to interpret the spectra you're looking
at right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are slowly bringing that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of a project I had in my
mind for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just hope now that other people see
the value in it and I'm learning new
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like databases and user interactions with
websites, things that as a chemist I never
[SPEAKER_02]: had to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I play with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's one of the perks of being in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to wear many hats and take on a
lot of things you never thought you'd get
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I study chemistry to not have to go
into a law career that my father wished
[SPEAKER_02]: for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My father's a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I studied chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like pattern lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, no, no, no, I'm not doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to be a chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the main things I have to deal
with is regulations and rules and the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: My company is in Canada because in Canada
it's federally legal and I'm allowed to do
[SPEAKER_02]: research by a federal agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can do it in collaboration with a
federally funded university because which
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis company can afford an NMR.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing it with the university so
that we have access to those
[SPEAKER_02]: instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I have to deal with law now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a very, very excited puppy that is
just coming back from a walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please excuse the tipping feet noise in
the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to come back to that cannabis
compound database.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that seems like a tremendous
resource for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many compounds are we up to?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are above 750.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that updates soon will bring us
over the 800 compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have over 200 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are around 80 cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there are over 140 already known,
but often they are just a letter
[SPEAKER_02]: combination and they don't even have a
physical description.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I can't really draw the compound,
we haven't added them yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were slowly trying to bring those in
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavonoids, we have a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also track sugars that are known to the
cannabis plant and should be of interest
[SPEAKER_02]: to track.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have even some proteins and minerals in
there that might actually be of interest
[SPEAKER_02]: for some practitioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over 800 compounds, how does that
compare to other herbs or plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, a few years back at a cannabis
conference, I saw a very good visual
[SPEAKER_02]: description about the complexity of the
cannabis plant versus other agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a mass spectrum trace of
cannabis extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a rosemary extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was basically a forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: The extract of cannabis was just a forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many compounds that I fully
understand that people go with.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like the term full spectrum because
defining this spectrum is so difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a cannabis plant that has,
well, we have 80 and in our database,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there are over 140 cannabinoids known.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of them are potentially medically
active or biologically active.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just blows most other plants out of
the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually talking about plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also other organisms that are of
medical interest like mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our company recently got a license to
research psilocybin mushroom compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are less tryptamines one has to
deal with than cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even compared to mushrooms,
it's much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, mushrooms are much easier than
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and this whole idea of that there are
these many different cannabinoids in trace
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts and they still may have a
medicinal benefit is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've seen it time and time again
where people have presented at CanMed of
[SPEAKER_00]: using THC in much lower doses in getting a
better medicinal effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one would stand to reason that there
could be other cannabinoids in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're not testing for that are in
small amounts, but really pack a punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, in my time in California when I
worked for a vertical cannabis company and
[SPEAKER_02]: I headed the extraction formulation
aspect, we also had a dispensary on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a mother coming by for a male
adult patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was suffering from adult onset
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was looking for a treatment as the
common classic medical solution hadn't
[SPEAKER_02]: helped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she wanted to try cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she after some discussion with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I'm not a medical doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could guide what I understand and guide
her towards medical help.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually the mother took home for
the patient a tincture of THC CBD one to
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, wait, it was a three to one CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she took that home and the patient got
immediate relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went down from nine seizures a day to
zero for the next two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after two months, the tincture is
running out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mother comes back and buys more of
this three to one CBD THC tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And starting the new tincture,
the patient starts to show epileptic
[SPEAKER_02]: seizures again.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're back.
[SPEAKER_02]: She uses the rest of the first tincture
and they're gone again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a three to one CBD THC tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we tested both again on the same day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We send it off to a testing lab and we got
the test back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was CBD THC three to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it should be, there was the same amount
of THC acid in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the same amount of CBD acid,
nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBN both nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBC more or less the same concentration
between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically the test results were more
were effectively identical of what we
[SPEAKER_02]: could see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because unbeknown to anyone else in the
company except the formulation team.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make these tinctures with CBD isolate
plus THC extract from our CO2 machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used to use diamond OG for the THC
part of that tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point that oil had run out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we switched to the next cultivar which
was a sour diesel or Girl Scout cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we formulated to the exact same
concentrations of CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by that, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in both cases, you could call our THC
extract from the CO2 machine full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're different full spectrum but
they're full spectrum extracts with the
[SPEAKER_02]: same amount of THC and CBD in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the patient shows complete completely
different effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to our test results, they are
identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's something else that is of
importance, but we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this annoyed the hell out of me
because I have full control over the
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have full control over the formulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have control over the testing lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that I send it to a testing lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't actually have any control.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this question like what else is in
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you affect that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That just, so annoying that I had to leave
sunny California and move to rainy
[SPEAKER_02]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can imagine that would be
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to imagine that it must be
quite the task to even try to begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: tease that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the fact that, I mean, you've
identified over 800 compounds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you even begin to start trying to
determine which compounds are doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: and in what combination too?
[SPEAKER_00]: That adds a whole nother layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it is definitely something I
can't solve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the best advertisement tech
line on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a community like a CanMed
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point is that it has to be a
collaborative effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, one of the founding principles
of our company is fundamental
[SPEAKER_02]: collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I'm a chemist and I now have my
expertise in extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we work with university research
groups that are focused on computational
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry, on metabolomics, so analytical
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have collaborations with
pharmacologists, formulation science,
[SPEAKER_02]: the School of Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that if we just go through this
example, we have the skills to do full
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolomic workup to figure out like
every minute mass that comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then one can figure out from the mass and
the breakdown of those ions what the
[SPEAKER_02]: structure could be, compare that to
databases, hence our database.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the access to NMR to actually
identify the compounds if it's something
[SPEAKER_02]: new, if we isolate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have computational teams that we have
working models to dock cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes to various receptors and predict
their binding affinity which would give an
[SPEAKER_02]: indication of how strong or not strong
there might be a medical effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have pharmacologists with which we
can work on thinking about some actual in
[SPEAKER_02]: vivo studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the School of Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have access to mouse models or at
least like skin permeability, pick skin to
[SPEAKER_02]: just see how this actually absorbs for the
formulation aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all things that only work in a
team, only work in a collaborative effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it sounds like you have a lot
going on there at your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the compound database.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: And psilocybin testing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are you guys working on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we get into psilocybin,
which is now the new cannabis thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's the whole public market story and
craziness about this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I leave to the experts for everyone
on our podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing air quotes.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a moment, let's stay with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question that you post,
like how do we find these compounds that
[SPEAKER_02]: are important but currently not looked
for?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably impossible to do this on a
single extract and a single case,
[SPEAKER_02]: patient case.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to find new solutions or modern
solutions to those medical problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will involve a lot of data,
population size data sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot do it on one or two cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to look at dozens, hundreds,
thousands of cannabis plants to spot the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference by exclusion and comparison to
other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't just take one plant,
isolate every single compound and then try
[SPEAKER_02]: it on every single in vitro study one can
think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's just not doable from the
effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: So data analytics becomes something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually this topic of data analytics,
we also embrace in other fields of our
[SPEAKER_02]: research and extraction research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So coming back to the start of this call,
I'm considered an extraction expert
[SPEAKER_02]: because I remember that early 2017,
I got on stage and I explained to the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry what a design of
experiment is and how to optimize the CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction with six experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and that worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time in the industry,
that was something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: By now I've moved past that because six
experiments optimize something,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the imprecision is large.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the factors you can look at are small,
temperature and pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But water content in the plant,
mill size, machine, flow rate,
[SPEAKER_02]: all those influence extraction as well,
cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're looking at dozens of inputs,
dozens of factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're looking at dozens of
optimization targets, high terpene,
[SPEAKER_02]: pure cannabinoids, fast, all those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not doable with experimentation
or targeted experimentation anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're actually doing a big data
approach to extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with our customers and clients on
taking in their old data sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have thousands and thousands of
extraction runs and we can use now more
[SPEAKER_02]: advanced statistics that are beyond me as
a poor organic chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have my data scientists and
mathematicians on that to really tease out
[SPEAKER_02]: effects that are then better
understandable and controllable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, now we are extraction experts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like a big data approach has been very
fruitful so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a complicated question in cannabis
because not only is the system difficult,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also the input data is imprecise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone who worked in cannabis industry
and has seen people writing stuff down on
[SPEAKER_02]: paper understands that problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this data approach or the
modern technologies that are used in other
[SPEAKER_02]: fields should translate well into the
cannabis industry because we don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: historic baggage of how we have done stuff
before, because there wasn't a legal
[SPEAKER_02]: industry before.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's one of the benefits,
but we also don't have that history to
[SPEAKER_00]: fall back on either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pioneers, we have to build that all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said there is no baggage because
there was no legal industry, but there was
[SPEAKER_02]: a illegal or underground industry of
cannabis and that brings its own historic
[SPEAKER_02]: baggage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it is helpful and some of it is
not helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one has to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So therefore we move to a completely new
order.
[SPEAKER_02]: A new organism that has all its own
restrictions and illegalities,
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just when cannabis was sort of entering
the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it became too boring, I thought I'd
do something else.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very punk rock of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think punk rock does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like Euro techno, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know punk rock is very anti
mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep it underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was more thinking of what the audience
would partake in while listening to that
[SPEAKER_02]: music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, when I think psilocybin,
I think the Grateful Dead and Fish and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of stuff.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, I have to admit,
and I think that is by now known.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea of cannabis as a consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't know how cannabis smelled when
I started in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you smoked the leaves like I had
no clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I take all this knowledge into the
mushroom space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I again have no idea about any consumer
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just have to catch up and
understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mushrooms, I'm in the lucky situation
that Canada has already its solid legal
[SPEAKER_02]: framework for work for cannabis,
which allows us to do our research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have also now established a legal
framework for psilocybin research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somewhat behind in time and more
restrictive in its regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can do far less with mushrooms right
now that I can do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: One example is when you are in this space
of restricted compounds and organisms,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to buy them from a licensed
producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in cannabis, as everyone knows,
there's way too much cannabis right now on
[SPEAKER_02]: the market in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, getting anything for my
research is not an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Psilocybin, there are maybe single digit
number of producers that actually grow
[SPEAKER_02]: psilocybin mushrooms that you can legally
buy for research purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gets way more difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Numinous is a licensed dealer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the license you get for psilocybin
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are based in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're based around the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although around the corner of the library
of UBC is where you find your psilocybin
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms, but those I can't use for
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different type of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In closing, Marcus, I want to give you the
opportunity to plug any websites,
[SPEAKER_00]: social media, or anything that you want to
get across to the audience to learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the work that you're doing or to
connect with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, we set up a research laboratory
here in Vancouver, Canada, to help the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry in Canada, but also
internationally, because data is free to
[SPEAKER_02]: travel across borders.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also now in the psilocybin space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our company is called Complex Biotech
Discovery Ventures, LTD, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: mouthful, but the acronym is CBDV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the website is CBDV.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDVL.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDV was taken already, and the LTD needed
to go somewhere in the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's CBDVL.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you can find all our
research, our projects we do, how we can
[SPEAKER_02]: help various customers in the cannabis and
now in the psilocybin space, and also
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can find our compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be happy for anyone to reach out
and talk to how to make extraction or
[SPEAKER_02]: analytics better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
