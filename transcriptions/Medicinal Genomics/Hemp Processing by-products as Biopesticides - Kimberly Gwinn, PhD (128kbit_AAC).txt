[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, and like the last two speakers,
this is my first CanMed talk, so I am
[SPEAKER_01]: delighted to be here, and thank you to the
organizers for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I would like to acknowledge my
collaborators on this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dewey Trent is an undergraduate researcher
in my laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's did the work on the army worms that
we'll discuss later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony Wong is a professor and an institute
professor at the University of Tennessee
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Department of Food Science.
[SPEAKER_01]: She and her lab came up with the
technology to make the nano emulsions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Zach Hanson is a plant pathologist,
and he did the work on powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was at the University of Tennessee,
and now he's associated with Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: University.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear a lot in this conference about the
importance of hemp and the importance to
[SPEAKER_01]: human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also very important for animal
health, so if we look at the one health
[SPEAKER_01]: concept, where I want to focus our talk
today is on the third component,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the environmental health.
[SPEAKER_01]: In hemp, we have very good products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the cannabinoids, but we also have
a lot of other things that are produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the spent hemp, which is now being
used in many states as animal feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also be used to generate fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extractors recycle their solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things that are left over are what we
are using, and that is the small amount
[SPEAKER_01]: here, which is the byproduct of hemp
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can find a good use for this,
then we will have completed the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle for this particular plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has little or no environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we decided to take on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to the extractors, and they took
the products, and we took what was left
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've often called this our leftovers
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We submitted that to a microfluidizer with
grass, surfactants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grass simply means, generally,
regarded as safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an incredibly safe product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could eat it, but I don't recommend
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did in the microfluidizer is
simply make this into a nanoemulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very, very small molecules
suspended in a liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about salad dressing,
when you mix oil and water, when you do
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you get that quick emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is a stable emulsion that looks
similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in that emulsion is whatever is
left over.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this first batch, it was very high
still in the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That particular extractor didn't have a
good extraction of the full CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was mainly CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did distillation to get rid of the
cannabinoids and really concentrate on the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes, because the terpenes are the
things that we are interested in for
[SPEAKER_01]: insect fungicidal and fungicidal products.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at what happened to our DPT,
which is this distilled terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are mostly karyophylline, visible,
and hubulin, all sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minor terpenes included mostly the
monoterpenes and some other terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using terpene and terpenoid
interchangeably in this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: They aren't the same, and I understand
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the talk, I'll use several
abbreviations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is DPT, and that is our distilled
byproduct.
[SPEAKER_01]: TP, which is our crude byproduct.
[SPEAKER_01]: NE is simply our negative control,
which is surfactant only, no terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nene, which is our positive control,
it is a well-regarded biopesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the problems with natural products
is shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the nanoemulsion, we get a stable
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does get a little cloudy after 30 days,
but I've used some of these products up to
[SPEAKER_01]: six months to two years, and they still
have activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to see on this thing,
but there's a little tiny yellow bar there
[SPEAKER_01]: that is 20 microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very, very small molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: These nanoemulsions, these surfactants and
terpenes together are suspended in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first experiment was just a proof of
concept, so we worked with bean beetle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with bean beetle for two
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available commercially, it's easy to
get, it's easy to rear, and it's a model
[SPEAKER_01]: insect for testing this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did is we put the beans in a
filter, put them in a flask, then put that
[SPEAKER_01]: out on a piece of filter paper after we
dried them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put two pairs of beetles in there so
they would mate, and then we allowed them
[SPEAKER_01]: to lay their eggs on the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular insect lays its eggs,
and then the larvae bury into the bean
[SPEAKER_01]: itself, completely making the bean
unacceptable for consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at the end, we did a number of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We counted the numbers of eggs and
everything, but what I'm going to report
[SPEAKER_01]: today is basically our data on how many
adults emerged, but all this data is
[SPEAKER_01]: published in the paper FAE et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, what we saw was we treated only
with a nanoemulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got about 15 adults per dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That came out, whereas when we put these
other treatments on there, we lowered the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount with a 5% TP and a 5% DTP.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very excited about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought this was a great way to start
thinking about this as a potential control
[SPEAKER_01]: for this pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: This pest can cause a 90% loss of cowpeas
in storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important for people who are
legume storage producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at that in terms of the economic
loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: This follows the exact same data trend as
the adults per dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, we see that if we had the
economic loss of about 40% with the
[SPEAKER_01]: nanoemulsion alone, then we were down to
less than 5% with our best treatment,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was the 5% DTP.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, Zach Hanson's graduate
student was dealing with some powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was running trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, oh, can we put this in your
trial?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the first trial, we had the TP in the
trial, but we did not have the NE because
[SPEAKER_01]: we were just jumping into the experiment
midway.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at the area under the progress
curve, which is a common way that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathologists measure how much disease is
there, then we see that in the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had a very high response.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the biopesticides that we tested,
and this was strictly biopesticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: we saw a reduction of our material very,
very similar to that of the common
[SPEAKER_01]: biopesticides that are used to treat
powdery mildew in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the second run of this, the second
trial, we actually looked at our
[SPEAKER_01]: nanoemulsion, and we saw the same type of
response with our nanoemulsion alone,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also our nanoemulsion with the
terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We feel very confident that this is a
great way to control powdery mildew of
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided to go a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, we needed to get a new
formulation, so we went to another
[SPEAKER_01]: extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no control over what's coming into
our system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing we did was look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time, we sent it off to a company,
New Bloom in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that basically, in this time,
we have very few cannabinoids and mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided to use this without doing the
distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The distillation, if you're coming into
product formulation, is a very expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided to look at pathogens and pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pathogen is powdery mildew,
another powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we decided to look at caterpillars or
levodopterin larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the powdery mildew of squash,
if you aren't a plant pathologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: you probably don't know this, but powdery
mildews are very specific to their host.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the same as the powdery mildew
of hemp, but we got the same response.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this experiment, though, we did add
some chemical controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are shown in green.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other biopesticides are shown in gold,
and ours is in this deep orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically got, with our TP,
we got as good a control as we get with
[SPEAKER_01]: the synthetic pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, this tells us that we are
doing the right thing to control powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildews.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get a somewhat of a benefit if we
have the TP in there compared to the nano
[SPEAKER_01]: emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That difference is not statistically
significant, but it is also not
[SPEAKER_01]: statistically significant from the best
powdery mildew product that we could find
[SPEAKER_01]: at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to a different system looking at
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is if we feed it to the insect,
we make them eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, we used the nano emulsions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We incorporated it into artificial diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This artificial diet was used to rear the
insects from third instar, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardest instar.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the harder instars to kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people do this in very early instars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we fed this and we watched what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this study, we had water as our
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a nano emulsion control,
and we had two doses of the TP and the
[SPEAKER_01]: nano emulsion, a low dose and a high dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not see any statistical difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mortality of the insects and the low
dose, but in the high dose, we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: This high dose would be very important for
using to control our armyworm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know about fall armyworm,
fall armyworm is a very invasive pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, it's estimated to cause losses
of about $200 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one of the reasons we targeted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also because it is also a model insect and
we can compare to a lot of other studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also decided to look at bead armyworm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bead armyworm is a very close relative of
the fall armyworm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different species in the same genus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bead armyworm, there was no impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a good explanation for this
as of yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking at some of the digestive
enzymes and this type of thing that would
[SPEAKER_01]: help us get a clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a reason for this yet,
so we're trying to find that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also not a real significant pest of
crops in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I'm going to talk about is,
we started looking at, if a biotrophic
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen is affected, what is the effect
on a pathogen like Fusarium?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did what we call a poison food study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poison food studies are simply,
in this case, we took the emulsion,
[SPEAKER_01]: we spread it across the top of the media,
and then we put a plug of Fusarium in the
[SPEAKER_01]: center and monitored its growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this experiment, the first time we used
a Fusarium oxysperum and it is an isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: that we received from Bonnie Only and it
is an isolate that was derived from
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measured the days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each day we measured the colony growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became very obvious that we did have a
reduction in growth, but the reduction in
[SPEAKER_01]: growth is consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: On day two, day three, the nanoemulsion is
equal to the TP on day four and that trend
[SPEAKER_01]: consists all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really don't think this is a great
product to control something like
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium, but it does slow it down,
but it doesn't really control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to an isolate that we have from
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is probably Esporatrichoides and asked
the same question, got exactly the same
[SPEAKER_01]: result.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I think this is a great pesticide
for the powdery mildews, being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: treat something for Fusarium may not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are currently looking at this as a seed
treatment and seeing what happens when we
[SPEAKER_01]: put a seed that has Fusarium into the
treatment and see if we can get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In summary, we've had two proofs of
concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first proof of concept, we had that
there was activity against the bean beetle
[SPEAKER_01]: and was basically acting as a repellent in
that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the second, we looked at toxicity and
it is toxic to fall armyworm.
[SPEAKER_01]: In both cases, we looked at fungicidal
activity on a powdery mildew, remembering
[SPEAKER_01]: that these are different organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: One powdery mildew was of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had almost complete control and that
was equal to any biopesticide that was on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the acorn squash powdery mildew,
we had consistent with what someone would
[SPEAKER_01]: use if they were using what was available
as the best powdery mildew control at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In summary, what I've been saying is that
we do have byproducts from CBD extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can create a use for these products
using the nano emulsion technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's active against some insects and some
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a universal insecticide or a
universal fungicide, but we can do
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work very hard to get use
concentrations that are not phytotoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know anything about putting
terpenes on plants, terpenes are very
[SPEAKER_01]: phytotoxic when you apply them to the
surface, so we have to work on adjusting
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got those levels at this point and
we have a great potential, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a biopesticide development from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Mike, I'm looking for potential
collaborators and many different ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: take this technology further.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, I just wanted to say that
if we can develop this, we can use this
[SPEAKER_01]: product, then we can close the loop and
make cannabis one of the few crops that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be fully fulfill the goals of the One
Health initiatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for this nice presentation,
but I was a little bit confused because we
[SPEAKER_03]: have many cannabis cultivars very rich in
terpenes, very, very, very rich in
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes, but 100% susceptible to poultry
mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we are saying using the same
terpenes, we can control the poultry
[SPEAKER_03]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: How that works?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working on, I think your question
is, can we just use the terpenes and do
[SPEAKER_01]: this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying we have the plants that they
are rich in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are naturally producing the terpenes
in a very high level, but they are
[SPEAKER_03]: completely susceptible to poultry mildew,
as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and we don't know why because when we
first did the hemp experiment,
[SPEAKER_01]: I fully expected it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The poultry mildew to not have any
response at all, but it is, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of related to the fact that we have
the anana emulsion in there, and that
[SPEAKER_01]: allows a different uptake by the pathogen
than if it's just exposed to the terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: and the glands in like the hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that it's a matter of exposure
and how much is uptake by the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was somebody over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: For your fusarium studies, did you perform
a concentration dependence study using the
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp to ride bio pesticide?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not use a, we did not do a
concentration study.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did is we took the same amount
that we knew was not phytotoxic and the
[SPEAKER_01]: same concentration that we used on the
powdery mildew, on the plants for powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything above that was phytotoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also didn't see how low we could go,
but since we didn't get great responses
[SPEAKER_01]: with the highest concentration that we
felt we could use, we didn't pursue it any
[SPEAKER_01]: further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we don't have that kind of data for
seeds and the effects on seed germination,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we will be using higher concentrations
in those studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a ton of questions and focusing on
the application methodologies where are
[SPEAKER_04]: you or have you looked at, with regard to
seed, fumigant versus seed coating or
[SPEAKER_04]: delivery to plants, soil drenching effects
versus leaf spraying effects and
[SPEAKER_04]: influences on mycorrhizal and beneficial?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not looked at beneficials and we
are in the first stages of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we are finding because of some of my
other interests in other bioactive
[SPEAKER_01]: products, we've been looking at hemp seed
and fusarium and we find that if we do a
[SPEAKER_01]: surface sterilization of seed,
we still have fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are concerned about that as a
transmission and so we are hoping that if
[SPEAKER_01]: we can soak them in this with the nano
emulsion and it won't be toxic to seed
[SPEAKER_01]: germination because we don't know that at
this point, that we can perhaps get some
[SPEAKER_01]: better control of those internally
transmitted fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do these types of molecules have any prior
use in this application and do the pests
[SPEAKER_00]: ever show any kind of resistance or
tolerance over generations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a body of literature on essential
oils and these are common components of
[SPEAKER_01]: different essential oils, particularly the
karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been a standard test for a lot of
the insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, there is literature saying that
this is an insecticidal property.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a unique blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we've talked about with human
medicine, there is an entourage effect
[SPEAKER_01]: with pesticides as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know what this specific has
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first testing of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these individually and also as
components, sometimes major components of
[SPEAKER_01]: other essential oils have been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually with essential oils, we don't see
resistance developing because the
[SPEAKER_01]: different essential oils have different
terpenes have different modes of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be a little more risk of
developing resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is when we have these,
these are really terpenoids, then when we
[SPEAKER_01]: have these oxygens, at least with fungi,
we found that they are more fungicidal
[SPEAKER_01]: typically with these oxygens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't know exactly what the risk
of resistance for this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not done the experiment where we
go back and take the moths and make them
[SPEAKER_01]: and go back and start looking at
generation after generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this work on insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a plant pathologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was just beyond what I wanted to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to see out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
