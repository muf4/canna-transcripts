[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of keynote presenters,
my guest today is our CanMed 2021 keynote
[SPEAKER_00]: presenter in the safety focus area,
Grace Van Dong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grace is a scientific strategy leader for
Eurofins, where she has spent over 25
[SPEAKER_00]: years in the food and supplement industry,
specializing in contaminants analysis and
[SPEAKER_00]: risk assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has recently started applying that
expertise to the hemp industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping to establish contaminant testing
standards for the industry as a member of
[SPEAKER_00]: many different trade associations and
groups, including the AOAC, the US Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: Authority, and the HIA's Sampling and
Analytical Task Force.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, I speak with Grace about
her experience in the food testing
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, the need for better standards
for cannabis and hemp testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: what makes cannabis and hemp such a
difficult plant to test, how a risk
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment strategy can help ensure safe
products, and why safety and contaminant
[SPEAKER_00]: testing should be done throughout
cultivation and production of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into my conversation with
Grace, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Eurofins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eurofins is a world leader in food,

[SPEAKER_00]: Without any further ado, please enjoy my
conversation with CanMed 2021 keynote
[SPEAKER_00]: presenter, Grace Van Dong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Grace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have you here on the podcast
and also as our keynote presenter at
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the safety focus area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to admit that the safety focus
area is always a little challenging for us
[SPEAKER_00]: to select speakers for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you know, we like to attract
folks from many different facets of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hemp world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The researchers, physicians, nurses,
cultivators, lab managers, and typically
[SPEAKER_00]: the safety and lab testing topics are a
little, a little too technical for some
[SPEAKER_00]: people who aren't in that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the topic that you have laid
out is really applicable to everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's all about implementing best
practices to ensure product safety,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we can all agree is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was hoping we could start today with
you providing an overview of your
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'd be happy to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did, it's great that you
mentioned that your audience is usually in
[SPEAKER_02]: the safety side.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the health area, nurses and doctors,
and then come the lab managers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I took this risk assessment
approach actually from the emergency
[SPEAKER_02]: response system or from Codex,
where you assess if there's something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's happening, for example,
a disease or an exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it likely to cause illness?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or harm?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I use that into looking at
contaminants for food safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did was, because a long time
ago, I had somebody come to me and ask,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 2,400 ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you please tell me what I need to
test as far as contaminants and what I
[SPEAKER_02]: need to consider on this 2,400
ingredients?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at him and I was like,
I really have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably going to take a long,
long time and a ton of money for you to
[SPEAKER_02]: test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then on my research, I discovered on
this process of defining risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we ended up being able to come up
with a process where you look at your
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients, the materials you work with,
and then you determine which materials are
[SPEAKER_02]: high risk, medium risk, or low risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you categorize your ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then since most people only have a
limited amount of money to put to testing,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though safety is number one and
quality is to protect the consumers,
[SPEAKER_02]: it helps them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps them to focus their dollars on
the riskiest ingredients and cover more
[SPEAKER_02]: and do more for ensuring safety for the
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,400 ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the product, if you don't mind me
asking?
[SPEAKER_02]: The product was actually candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The products were candy, a whole series of
candy and a bunch of chocolate and gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that's near and dear to
a lot of us, and especially me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to do a really, you know,
it was a lot of work, but it's important
[SPEAKER_02]: to get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's very common in the food
industry, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a lot of ingredients that go
into one little product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before it goes into the shelf,
there's a lot of processes that happens,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's a lot of safety checks that
need to happen before it makes it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting because you look
at the back of the label and you certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see 2,400 ingredients listed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it just that there's other
ingredients involved in sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that go into the final product
that don't have to be reported on that
[SPEAKER_00]: label?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, the 2,400 ingredients is that
entire company's ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different products.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want 2,400 ingredients in a
chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, I thought it was a
fairly straightforward thing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forgive me for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you said, your Canada presentation
is a lot about risk assessment when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to contaminants in cannabis and hemp
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to those products,
cannabis and hemp products, which do you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel have kind of the greatest risk in
terms of contaminants?
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean the products or the contaminants
itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's start with the contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that there's microbial
contaminants, contamination, heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you kind of rank them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess they're all pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're all pretty bad and they're
important, but they're important in
[SPEAKER_02]: different stages of the life of what we
call from seed to shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we all know in the hemp world,
the hemp is a phytoremediator,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means it absorbs things from
whatever is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, you have to start with
good quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not much of concerns for
contaminants there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get into the ground, you start
the exposure to contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the risk is.
[SPEAKER_02]: How likely is it to be there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how likely is there going to be
multiple contaminants present in the
[SPEAKER_02]: sample?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in that material that you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the beginning, pesticides and heavy
metals are really important because as you
[SPEAKER_02]: plant it, as in as you're growing it,
that's really what you expose your hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the farmers don't necessarily
apply pesticides as they're growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: except in really emergency needs and when
there's an infestation or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crops that were there before,
some pesticides could have been used for
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also the pesticides that
have lingered in the soil from DDT,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, from 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't want to go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still there even at low levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the heavy metals, which are just
part of the soil, you know, lead,
[SPEAKER_02]: cadmium, arsenic, and sometimes,
and then as you grow them, you use water
[SPEAKER_02]: to irrigate and you have to think about
the irrigation system, what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants you're introducing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those usually are also pesticides and
some synthetic compounds that you
[SPEAKER_02]: introduce as you grow that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that early stage, your focus is
pesticides and then heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you harvest it, then you get into
the then you introduce some of the micro
[SPEAKER_02]: because of storage and when there's
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the pesticides still, you inherit
the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you store them, there are all
still areas that use pesticides or
[SPEAKER_02]: insecticides for cleaning in the material
area where you store them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could expose it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then microorganisms start growing and
then you can start having problems if the
[SPEAKER_02]: storing is not proper and there's
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take that from the material
that you have and then you get into
[SPEAKER_02]: processing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the extraction part.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you extract it, that's when you start
introducing the risk for residual solvents
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's what you use to extract
them and the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you clean it up, there's a high
possibility that residual solvents could
[SPEAKER_02]: still remain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes mistakes happen in the
extraction process and it's not the right
[SPEAKER_02]: solvent or something as things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are, of course, extreme situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you go take your extract and
you go into the production of other
[SPEAKER_02]: products where you incorporate your
extract or your oils, you introduce other
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you buy ingredients and some of it,
like, for example, you combine your
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts with frankincense or some exotic
scents and essential oils, you introduce a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of, then you go back to increasing the
risk for contaminants again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for the higher risk
contaminants is if you're importing
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients from outside of the United
States or you're taking ingredients
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of the intended market,
geographical market of your product,
[SPEAKER_02]: the laws and regulations are different in
other parts of the world to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in the food industry,
in the EU, carbaryl no longer has a
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerance for grapes or it's very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a low Q of the method.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the United States, carbaryl is allowed
at 10 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could be making a product that
you're getting from grapes here in the U
[SPEAKER_02]: .S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and be perfectly comfortable that you're
then you find carbaryl, you'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly comfortable here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're well under what's allowed
at 10 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send it over to you and your product will
be out of compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because carbaryl is not allowed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happens a lot back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, for apple juice concentrate,
the methoate or methoate is allowed in
[SPEAKER_02]: Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we import here into the United States,
the methoate, the tolerance for the
[SPEAKER_02]: methoate in apples has been revoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it now becomes not compliant,
even though it was compliant from where it
[SPEAKER_02]: came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it enters here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the regulations enter into that a whole
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to be taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's basically at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you bottle your... So that's
basically how you look at the distribution
[SPEAKER_02]: of the contaminants for hemp anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to determine what you're
doing with it, where it's coming from and
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going and all the other things that
when you have final product, that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: derived product.
[SPEAKER_02]: What went into the product and where all
those things came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems that the best practice really
is to be doing ongoing testing throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire life of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The life of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that so much of... On the medicinal
genomic side, we work with labs and
[SPEAKER_00]: provide them with microbial testing
technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really at the end stage of all
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the final product that gets tested
before it can finally go to sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of manufacturers or
cultivators think that that's where the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like there should have been
a lot of testing going on before then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you think about it,
if you're making a product... We used to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a long time ago, we used to have this
saying in the food industry, a lot of my
[SPEAKER_02]: years was spent with the food industry,
that if you're testing the final product,
[SPEAKER_02]: by the time it's in the can, it's too late
to correct anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you test your final product and
you find contamination, you already have
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands, if not millions of cans sitting
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do with those now?
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you create a practice where you're
tracking it from... Especially because
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp is such as... Although it's been in
existence for a while, a lot of this best
[SPEAKER_02]: practices is new.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of background data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't know...
[SPEAKER_02]: The predictability of having contamination
is still not as well set as it is in some
[SPEAKER_02]: food matrices in the food world that we've
been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like apples, oranges, you know the risk
and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally know the contaminant risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the long answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The short answer to your question is yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is really good practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: To keep an eye on your product from seed
to shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And correct me if I'm wrong, but that's a
difference between at least on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis side and food testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I know in the US that we have third
party labs that sort of test the final
[SPEAKER_00]: product to give it the stamp of approval
before it goes on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, correct me if I'm wrong,
that's not really how food testing works,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more sort of on the manufacturing
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, glad I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are testing that is in the
manufactured plants that are necessary for
[SPEAKER_02]: them to do in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like their quality requirements and
they're usually fast test.
[SPEAKER_02]: But food companies actually use third
party labs a lot because it is very
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive to maintain your own lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not only the food testing
laboratories, the food testing,
[SPEAKER_02]: they utilize in the food industry third
parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I define it for two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The things that should be in food and the
things that should not be in food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can't, which means like your
nutritional label, your proxamines,
[SPEAKER_02]: your fat, calories, your vitamins.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what should be in food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my world, which are the things
that should not be in food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the pesticide contaminants,
heavy metals, any other contaminants that
[SPEAKER_02]: you could think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And testing, the go-to is usually a third
party lab because it is very, like I said
[SPEAKER_02]: in the beginning, it's very expensive to
maintain your own lab in house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does require a lot of equipment,
expensive equipment and highly trained
[SPEAKER_02]: people to be able to produce the kind of
quality that we use the term defensible in
[SPEAKER_02]: court.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have to consider safety and
compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the contaminant side, they use as
often because not a whole lot of food
[SPEAKER_02]: companies nowadays, it used to be more
have their own testing labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've gone to the third party route.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes people think that it's not
really required to test for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take a risk, you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no law that asks you to test for
pesticides or heavy metals, but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually not a hundred percent true
because the law in the food industry says
[SPEAKER_02]: that you cannot introduce adulterated food
into the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then pesticides and heavy metals are
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're defined by law as adulterants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So indirectly, yeah, you have to because
you cannot have adulterants in your food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to test for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And third party labs are the way to go for
a lot of companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a lot less.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a lot more sense economically to
use a third party lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's where my misunderstanding
lied or laid was with that there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of strict law that says you must send
it to this lab and have them sign off on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's sort of just a more broad general
law that says, you know, you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce anything that's contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the way that they they meet that
mandate is to send it to a lab like yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they they don't they they suggest
methods and all the stuff, but they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: dictate you to go to a certain lab like
they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have these registrations like
TA registrations and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to continue in sort of this vein of
comparing cannabis and hemp to more
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional food testing, how is cannabis
and hemp testing kind of different than
[SPEAKER_00]: food testing just in terms of like the
matrix itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a more difficult matrix to work with
when you're looking for things like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It it more difficult would be like an
understatement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant material is very complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a lot of, you know, you have all
those kind of I'm going to speak about for
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants because that's I know that
very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took us a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, when you in food,
just take an apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple is mostly 90 percent water,
some sugar in there, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: minerals, and it's nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you when you inject it into a,
for example, when you do that,
[SPEAKER_02]: your extraction, you inject it into the
into a GC, you get a nice long baseline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's some pesticides,
the peak comes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the method.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very easy to hemp, on the other hand,
is like there's so many things you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's like a field of grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like a field of you're going
through a field of grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas when you're doing apple,
you're like walking on paved road.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very the matrix itself is very
complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are compounds that are that are
present in there that could mimic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very similar to sometimes the
pesticides themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have difficulty in separating them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whereas in in many of the food that's
established already, you could easily do a
[SPEAKER_02]: screen for 300 to 500 pesticide compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not the case for hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's quite challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you have to meet ISO
standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it becomes really expensive when you
have to validate for testing and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in talking with other other folks in
the lab testing space, one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they always come back with as being
one of the major challenges in doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing has has to do with
standardization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the kind of the first thing is
kind of is in line with what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about was just having good
standards to work off of in terms of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the different cannabinoids and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that sort of lack of standard
make things even more difficult for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: It it challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's challenging for everybody because
that is the basis of your ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: quantify your results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're if lab A uses a standard,
they're assuming that they're all the
[SPEAKER_02]: same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for example, cannabinoid A,
I'm just going to do it in general terms,
[SPEAKER_02]: a cannabinoid A and lab A standard is
ninety nine percent pure in that for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid A, whereas lab B is when you
finally look at it, the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid A for the reference standard
for lab B is ninety five percent pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have a four percent difference in
in in results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference will be consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless and hopefully unlike other
materials, NIST has reference standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you all know that this is when you
know you can you can calibrate to that
[SPEAKER_02]: material because everybody agrees that
that material has this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have many of that around for the
cannabis and hemp world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet in the testing, pesticides is
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the cannabinoids, because
pesticides, the reference standards are
[SPEAKER_02]: very well established.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to sort of continue that line on
standards, I know that you're involved
[SPEAKER_00]: with a couple of different groups who are
sort of trying to establish some standards
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of in different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess let's start with with the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp Authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking at from a lab safety
perspective in terms of I know that well,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me backtrack.
[SPEAKER_00]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp Authority is working on kind of
certifying companies who are distributing
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I know you're involved with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you looking at from a lab
safety perspective when you're looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: certify companies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, what they're looking to
certify is the good practices from from
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in different areas of the from from
the growing to the production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically, because there's not only
the actual reference standards,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's a lack of standards itself on
on how what you do when you have this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, you know, how do you harvest it,
how do you test it and what testing should
[SPEAKER_02]: be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the the the goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for me, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp Authority, the certification program
is to standardize this and to give those
[SPEAKER_02]: that are involved in the hemp industry a
good solid ground to look at as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: what is what how do you work with within
the industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: You test the product and so that you can
assure a high quality and quote unquote
[SPEAKER_02]: safe product for consumers out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just a little plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guidance three, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp Authority has just come out actually
with the guidance three and it's out for
[SPEAKER_02]: public comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'd be great if everybody could look
at that and in the hemp world and comment
[SPEAKER_02]: on the guidance that because it was
revised, especially with the IFR that just
[SPEAKER_02]: after the IFR came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be happy to put a link in the show
description, too, so people can easily
[SPEAKER_00]: find that and submit their comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does sort of the certification or
the standards that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp Authority is creating, how would that
differ from what we hope eventually the
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA will come out with in terms of safety
standards?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually very aligned to there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's everything that we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope we purposely made sure that it's
aligned with the USDA and and all the and
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of auditing groups there so that
everybody has the same standard to work
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're they're aligned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes the requirement of the
certification is a little more robust in
[SPEAKER_02]: some area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in other areas, the the USDA is more
robust, although if you have the hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: certification, you will be meeting the the
goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal is that you're meeting the USDA
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're sort of that sort of you're
meeting it and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the other groups that you're
that you're working with and it sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: ties into some of the these USDA
requirements that came out with with the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm bill is I know that one of the groups
that you're working with is the HIA is
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling an analytical task force for sort
of coming up with standards around
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that that's that's needed
because and correct me if I'm wrong here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when those standards originally came
up for the farm bill, there was quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between the sampling standards
that they set out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There as compared to sort sort of like
some of the international standards that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been in place elsewhere outside of
the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't know if you wanted to kind of
briefly comment on how the what the
[SPEAKER_00]: disconnect is between those two sets of
standards and maybe give a glimpse into
[SPEAKER_00]: what you guys are working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's always the same problem
with sampling because it's statistics and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's very difficult for people to
come to an agreement on what really is the
[SPEAKER_02]: best approach to sampling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are many, many things to
consider, like even just idea of sampling,
[SPEAKER_02]: what part of the plants do you sample to
define that and how much percent comes
[SPEAKER_02]: from the top, from the middle,
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that that is up for discussion
because there are always many,
[SPEAKER_02]: many points of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the end, what and it's like,
you know, many ways to skin a cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of them are statistically valid,
depending on how you look at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the aim, I think that's the
aim of the of the HIA's sampling task
[SPEAKER_02]: force is to come up with a not only a
relevant and a solid fit for purpose
[SPEAKER_02]: sampling plan, but it's also not not
burden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not a it's not going to be a
burden for the the growers or the people
[SPEAKER_02]: in the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to get that balance of the fit
for purpose and the practical and the
[SPEAKER_02]: practical aspect of the sampling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to marry them together so that
we all are happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can all do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's because if you make
the sampling part is part is very is key
[SPEAKER_02]: because if your sampling is messed up,
then it doesn't matter what you do
[SPEAKER_02]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: The testing becomes irrelevant if the
sampling is messed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interpretation is is is going to be
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important that everybody that the
sampling portion is not so difficult that
[SPEAKER_02]: people get discouraged and don't follow
the proper way of sampling anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to marry that practical and
fit for purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it sounds sounds challenging
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that when I had spoke with I
believe it was Briana Cassidy,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is another lab manager who's going to
be presenting at Can Med.
[SPEAKER_00]: She she said that the difference in
potency in one cannabis plant from one
[SPEAKER_00]: blood one bud to another can be vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be as much as 50 percent
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus or minus, which sort of blew my mind
a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine that that's something you
need to keep in mind when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about sampling to try to get a
true representation of what this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're dealing with we're dealing with
an organic material.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's it's it's very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weather, the amount of sunlight two
days ago or the thing or where you cut it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so many factors affect the uniform
distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if you because if you if
you think about it, it's like the
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had like a whole basket of
blueberries and you sometimes apply
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides on the surface or it gets mold
on the surface, if you don't mix it
[SPEAKER_02]: properly and if you don't quarter it,
portion it, you could end up just getting
[SPEAKER_02]: the top and a whole bin, a whole a whole
load of your contaminant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you mix it, then you distribute it
evenly and you you have a better
[SPEAKER_02]: representation of the entire sample
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's and that's really one of the
key things to consider when you're.
[SPEAKER_02]: Creating or writing a standard for
sampling and the plant material is the
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp is a very challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's yes, it's a challenge and every
and hopefully we can all come to an
[SPEAKER_02]: agreement on because if everybody's doing
it the same way, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the you have confidence that you'll all be
getting the same results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and finally, I kind of working down
your resume here, your involvement with
[SPEAKER_00]: AOAC as well and the CASP task force.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if you could tell us a bit about
what you guys are working on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the the AOAC CASP program is actually
working on a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have they have a group that's
involved with the mycotoxins and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: the group with the cannabinoids and the
group that I'm involved in is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: training and education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think CASP has they were the one
that established the method for testing
[SPEAKER_02]: for for the potents, the cannabinoid,
the concentration, the cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_02]: the THC concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they so they're they're the group is
aiming to standardize the analytical
[SPEAKER_02]: testing portion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is also part for sampling.
[SPEAKER_02]: But and they're trying to put that
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully the HIA, the AOAC,
the USDA and everybody could be aligned in
[SPEAKER_02]: their approach to sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess that's one of the
challenges of multiple groups trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: set standards is that there needs to be
some standardization amongst amongst them
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just in closing here, Grace,
I don't know if there's any closing
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts you want to have or if you want
to give folks either your social media if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on it or any ways to get in touch
with you for any additional questions
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your opportunity now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just the one thing that I kind of
always like to tell people is don't forget
[SPEAKER_02]: your contaminants, especially your
chemical contaminants, because they they
[SPEAKER_02]: they are important and you need to to be
cognizant that they they are present and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you could potentially expose your
consumers to contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if if you're not paying attention to
them and to contact me, I'm on LinkedIn
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my email is on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much my social media
presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably healthier for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they connected me on LinkedIn,
I would be able to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you again, Grace, for taking
