[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome today to my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Lauren Sands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a senior technician at Safe Teva Labs
in Westfield, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, I'm actually presenting on my
grad schoolwork that I was so lucky to
[SPEAKER_00]: conduct at the University of Connecticut
under Dr. Gerald Berkowitz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the clicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as said, the title of my talk is The
Analysis of Hormonal Regulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: Promoter Activities of Cannabis Sativa of
Prenotransferase I and IV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the research goals for this,
my grad schoolwork, was to, one,
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a better understanding of the
enzymes that produce cannabiduralic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGA, in terms of functionality,
location, and importance in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, we wanted to conduct
studies involving hormone treatments to
[SPEAKER_00]: gather information regarding which hormone
signaling pathways are actually involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabinoids are obviously produced in
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different types of trichomes
on the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're specifically interested in the
glandular stalk trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are small hair-like projections that
are made up of stalk and head tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: most commonly found on leaves and flowers,
on cannabis plants, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: on un-pollinated female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trichomes are the cannabinoid and
terpene factories that we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the center image, you can see a quick
little diagram of this trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the base of a stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the top, the secretory vesicles and
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top, this base, this is what we're
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, we're interested in this
head of the glandular trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This contains the cannabinoids and the
enzymes producing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzyme that I mentioned that produces
CBGA, this is the one we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see on the left a structure of
the cannabinoid trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the right, you can actually
see the cannabinoid biosynthetic pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: written out, showing you the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top on the right of this cannabinoid
biosynthetic pathway shows you the
[SPEAKER_00]: plastid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in blue, it's connected to
the diagram on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the rosette of gland cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the bottom of the head of the
glandular trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this contains the enzymes that produce
CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBGA is actually produced in the
rosette at the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is exported to the secretory
reservoir, which you can see in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is indicated on the left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see CBGA is produced in the
base, exported to the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to figure out why the
enzyme is making CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the star.
[SPEAKER_00]: The star indicates the CBGA synthase
enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGA synthase has been referred to as many
different things in literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been referred to as CBGA synthase,
or GOT, geranyl diphosphate olivatolyte
[SPEAKER_00]: transferase, or in my case, PT4,
prenal transferase 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just really interested in this
CBGA synthase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get more into that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main reason why our lab decided to
focus on this prenal transferase enzyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGA synthase, is because we initially did
a research study over the course of a
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the flowers and we measured CBGA
synthase, in this case, PT4.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured this gene expression over the
course of the flowering period,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as we took the cannabinoid content
and we measured the CBGA in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw at week four, CBGA is peaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at week four, this PT4 gene expression
level, it's peaking as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see a positive
correlation increases, then decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see on the right,
we also did this with THCA and THCA
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that THCA contents peaking at week
six, but there's no positive correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: with THCA synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to put less focus on this
THCA synthase enzyme and more focus on the
[SPEAKER_00]: prenal transferase genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these precursor enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to understand cannabinoid
synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the enzyme that's producing the
cannabinoid that's needed for conversion
[SPEAKER_00]: towards endpoint cannabinoid synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we know, CBGA is the mother of all
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBGA synthase enzymes are prenal
transferases.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are membrane bound enzymes localized
to plant plastids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in cannabis, we've identified 10 of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literature has actually pointed to the
fact that PT4, this is the main CBGA
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some papers have referenced that
PT1 is capable of producing CBGA,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically in a patent done by Jonathan
Page and his group in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of research, literature
review showing that is it PT1 or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: PT4?
[SPEAKER_00]: So both have shown CBGA synthesis
capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, yeast assays have revealed that
PT4's only substrate is olivatolic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but PT1 is promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PT1 is able to work with different
substrates, olivatolic acid, olivitol,
[SPEAKER_00]: naringin, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: PT1's affinity for this substrate,
olivatolic acid was shown to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, PT1 was 60 millimolar, while PT4
was 6.27 micromolars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the affinity for this
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PT4 was shown to have a 10,000 stronger
affinity for this substrate, olivatolic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, when put into this yeast
system and when PT4 and PT1 were put into
[SPEAKER_00]: the yeast systems and fed olivatolic acid,
it was shown that PT4, in a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: studies, PT4 was producing this CBGA,
while PT1 was showing little to no
[SPEAKER_00]: production of CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while literature points to PT4 being
the main CBGA synthase enzyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: we figured with all this literature,
maybe let's just look at both prenatal
[SPEAKER_00]: transferases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to understand why these prenatal
transferase genes that produce the enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: are producing CBGA, we decided to look at
their promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So promoters are the sequence upstream of
the transcription start site that regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA transcription and basically tell the
gene whether to turn on, turn off,
[SPEAKER_00]: not work at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these promoters have responsive
elements throughout the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And promoters can be anywhere from 5,000
to 2,000 base pairs, upwards of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout these regions, there's
responsive elements that respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: various stimuli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stimuli such as hormones, specific
transcription factor families,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these regions are actually highly
conserved across promoters, so it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice you can look at other organisms in
these databases, such as PLACE and Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Care, to see if maybe your promoter also
has these putative responsive elements and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they also respond to these specific
stimuli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, if they're responsive to these
stimuli, this can activate an increased
[SPEAKER_00]: expression or repress the expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there's all these different
responsive elements that are contained in
[SPEAKER_00]: the promoter, we decided to focus solely
on hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hormones are chemicals produced by
plants that regulate their growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: development, reproductive processes,
etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, hormones are known to be
super involved in flowering in different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, especially it's been shown in
hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to focus on this,
because hormones are definitely involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in secondary metabolite production,
and plants, likely in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There haven't been too many studies on it,
but it's pretty clear that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in secondary metabolite
production in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these hormone responsive elements,
they are long stretches of DNA that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to bind to proteins that are
activated as these hormones are released
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant as the hormone signaling
pathways get active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these hormones shown on the slide,
of course, there's many more in plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are the ones that we focused on for
our studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we use these databases,
and these are the hormones that we
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered are likely responsive in our
promoters of prenatal transferase 1 and 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have ethylene, abscisic acid,
gibberellin, cytokinin, salicylic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we predict that these hormones,
not only a few of them are interacting
[SPEAKER_00]: with these prenatal transferase promoters,
we predict that they're all working
[SPEAKER_00]: together in this orca that is cannabinoid
synthesis in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to clone the 600 base
pairs upstream of the prenatal transferase
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 transcription start site, shown here on
the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified this using NCBI,
and of course, the responsive element
[SPEAKER_00]: databases provided us with these hormones
for prenatal transferase 4's promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these hormones, some of them might
activate the promoter promoters,
[SPEAKER_00]: some might not, they might work
synergistically, antagonistically,
[SPEAKER_00]: or not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were actually able to clone this
promoter, and we used it to examine the
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone, we used it to examine,
sorry, to examine the effects of hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment on the promoters, as well as a
variety of assays for promoter activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: localization, and cannabis plants using
GUS assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were also able to do this with
prenatal transferase 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were actually able to clone more of the
promoter of this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 1500 base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on this screen, there's a
little bit more responsive elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gibberellins, salicylic acid,
auxin, and abscisic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to clone these promoters
from genomic DNA from cannabis sativa hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: in our lab at UConn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cloned them and we inserted them into
vectors, either tagged with luciferase or
[SPEAKER_00]: GUS reporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these constructs with our promoters
were utilized in dual luciferase assays or
[SPEAKER_00]: GUS assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luciferase reporter assays investigate
whether stimuli can activate or repress
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription using the gene luciferase,
and GUS assays are used for localization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the functional GUS gene that's
produced, it makes blue coloration in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant upon integration to the plant
hormone, plant genome, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, we wanted to confirm the
location of the greatest activity of
[SPEAKER_00]: prenatal transferase genes and promoters
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left, you can see we performed
quantitative PCR on our flowering plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sixth week of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that the mRNA expression levels
of both prenatal transferase 1 and 4 were
[SPEAKER_00]: highly, the gene activity was much higher
in the flower and leaf compared to our
[SPEAKER_00]: root control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after confirming the location of gene
transcript location activity, we wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: visualize these genes in the cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used our promoter GUS constructs and
we took cannabis seedlings and sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, and we were able to visualize
these promoters in the dark blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is where the promoters
are active in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see seedlings on the left
and sugar leaves on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see in the sugar leaves,
which are the leaves that form around the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers as the plant matures, we saw
greater activity in the dark blue for
[SPEAKER_00]: prenatal transferase 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually a really cool
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was our prenatal transferase 4
promoter tagged with GUS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the sugar leaves in the
dark blue in the trichomes, we were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to confirm that our promoter was very
active in these regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only did this confirm that this is
where it's active, we also confirmed that
[SPEAKER_00]: these promoters were capable of driving
different reporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to read the activation of our promoters
in vitro, we utilize protoplasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are cells without cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without these cell walls, they can
accept DNA and transiently express this
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so using dual luciferase assays,
we can measure this DNA expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we enzymatically isolated protoplasts
and prepared them for transient expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of plasmids containing PT promoters
driving the luciferase reporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overnight transfection and hormone
treatments were completed following that
[SPEAKER_00]: of hormones at concentrations of 10
micromolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also used negative and positive
controls in this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cells were then collected for five
hours following this hormone treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the protoplasts containing our
plasmids were frozen and used in further
[SPEAKER_00]: dual luciferase assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see on the right here,
this is an experiment done on Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows that the promoters are active
following hormone treatment in the five
[SPEAKER_00]: hours post hormone treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why we use these few hours
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured this promoter activity with
the luciferase assays, as said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this case, we're investigating
if our stimuli, this hormone, can activate
[SPEAKER_00]: our promoter to initiate transcription of
this luciferase gene located downstream of
[SPEAKER_00]: this promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually using the luciferase
gene found in fireflies and in sea
[SPEAKER_00]: pansies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their protoplasts are transfection
with phenyltransferase, firefly,
[SPEAKER_00]: luciferase constructs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our promoter of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also co-transfected it with a 35S
constitutive promoter, which is tagged
[SPEAKER_00]: with our ranilla luciferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these frozen protoplasts that we
collected previously are lysed,
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed with reagents, either luciferin for
our firefly luciferase, our promoters of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest, or mixed with Coelanterazine for
our ranilla luciferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this reaction creates luminescence in
our luminometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ratio is created and considered
relative luminescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this directly correlates with the
activation of the promoter following
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are our results for
phenyltransferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're presenting the response towards
hormones that did result in promoter
[SPEAKER_00]: activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see some hormones that did not
activate the promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used methyljasminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This did not have a hormone responsive
element predicted in the promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw no response from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these graphs, they show relative
luminescence, the ratio created from
[SPEAKER_00]: firefly to ranilla luciferase in our
protoplasts following hormone treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some hormones were administered as
either a synthetic hormone or a precursor,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how these hormones exist in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So firstly, exogenous ethylene
administered as one amino cyclopropane,
[SPEAKER_00]: one carboxyl acid, this is the precursor
as ethylene is gaseous, led to significant
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter activity five hours past
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exogenous hypoxic acid led to significant
promoter activity at three and five hours
[SPEAKER_00]: past treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exogenous gibberellin administered as
gibberellic acid three, led to significant
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter activation at hours three and
five past treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, exogenous cytokinin
administered as tranzeotine riboside,
[SPEAKER_00]: led to significant promoter activation at
hours three and five past treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went a little bit more in depth with
salicylic acids connection to prenatal
[SPEAKER_00]: transferase four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We predicted that salicylic acid is likely
involved or very involved in cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis because salicylic acid is a
plant defense hormone and cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: among their many purposes, they are
produced to play a role in defending the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant from pathogens including insects,
fungi, viruses, and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a previous experiment, we saw an
increase in gene transcript levels in
[SPEAKER_00]: prenatal transferase four following a soil
drench treatment containing one millimolar
[SPEAKER_00]: of salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it's a very tiny graph at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually saw a hundredfold increase in
prenatal transferase four gene expression
[SPEAKER_00]: three days post-SA treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw already that the gene transcript
levels are affected by this hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, we expected to be affected
in the promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see that CSPT4 promoter was
activated at hours three and four past
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment for salicylic acid in PT4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually decided to perform
site-directed immunogenesis on this
[SPEAKER_00]: salicylic acid response development in the
prenatal transferase four promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to create point mutations in
this response development shown in red,
[SPEAKER_00]: the red base pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pairs were switched and I repeated
this promoter hormone treatment with this
[SPEAKER_00]: mutated promoter and I then saw no
response to salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're essentially confirming that this
putative responsive element is a bona fide
[SPEAKER_00]: cis-acting element that is involved in
salicylic acid signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think salicylic acid is a great
hormone to look at in the future for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid synthesis and its effects on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we saw many effects from prenatal
transferase four, we also looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: prenatal transferase one, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't see as great responses or higher
responses, more hormones in the response
[SPEAKER_00]: of prenatal transferase ones promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw, we did see activation at hours
one, three and five for salicylic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: at one, three and five for oxen and at
hours three past treatment for abscisic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different hormones affecting
each prenatal transferase promoter there's
[SPEAKER_00]: different sets of hormones affecting each
promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're thinking maybe there's different
functionality in these prenatal
[SPEAKER_00]: transferase genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically, it's giving a little bit
more insight into how these different
[SPEAKER_00]: prenatal transferase genes act in the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll wrap this up really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think plant hormones are almost
certainly very involved in cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis and signaling pathways affecting
the cannabinoid biosynthetic pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormone networks in cannabis as seen
in other plants are very interconnected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing multiple hormones working on
the same promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely needs to be more
research involved in how, why and when
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones are produced in the cannabis
plant during flowering, how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting prenatal transferase genes and
the effects on one hormone on another is
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see again, these hormones on
the bottom left are ones that we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: response in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the promoters for these genes,
both promoters respond to salica acid and
[SPEAKER_00]: abscisic acid and these hormone networks
in plants have been shown to work together
[SPEAKER_00]: in many different plants or against each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we should conduct more studies
on these promoters and hormones in the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual plant throughout flowering to
understand how cannabinoid synthesis is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can help a lot in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, if anybody ever decides to do growth
promoter, growth regulators as hormones
[SPEAKER_00]: and just understanding how cannabinoids
are produced in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good to get a good
understanding on how it's made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we can further understand how
cannabinoids are produced in the plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical purposes, growing purposes,
and just to better understand our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the sources for anybody interested
in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, CAM Med, Medicinal Genomics and
Advanced Nutrients.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great talk, Lauren.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one question on these hormone
sequences that you're highlighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fairly short in sequence,
which means if you scan the whole genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll find them somewhere, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed from some previous methylation
sequencing that we've done before that,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least not on the parental transverse
forebearing gene, but on the TSC synthase
[SPEAKER_01]: gene, there's all types of weird
methylation happening on the five prime
[SPEAKER_01]: promoter of that gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed you made a mutation up there
that introduced a CPG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible that there's an epigenetic
component here of how these hormones are
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating these sequences?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the mechanism of the sequence site?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a protein that's binding to it,
you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the responsive elements?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the responsive elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I understand your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: These short DNA binding sequences,
they're specifically somehow binding to
[SPEAKER_00]: the transcription factors that are
activated through the hormone signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, obviously, I don't have this data
with the types of hormone treatments you
[SPEAKER_01]: did, but I can share it through a bunch of
bisulfite sequencing we did on plants
[SPEAKER_01]: before and after flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, it might show some CPG
methylation that might be playing a role
[SPEAKER_01]: in those signatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll connect after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this data was accepted this
morning for publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone's interested, please check it
out in Scientific Reports.
Thank you.
