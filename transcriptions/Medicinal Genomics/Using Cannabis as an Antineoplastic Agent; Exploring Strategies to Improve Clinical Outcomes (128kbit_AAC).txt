[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon, or I might even say good
evening.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to thank Doug and Bonnie
Goldstein and the organizers of the
[SPEAKER_09]: conference for inviting me to moderate.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd also like to thank the remarkable
panel that has agreed to share their
[SPEAKER_09]: knowledge with us today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a retired cardiologist who first
became interested in cannabinoid oncology
[SPEAKER_09]: when I saw Mara Gordon show brain scans
from patients with brain tumors who were
[SPEAKER_09]: treated with cannabis and had
well-documented shrinkage of the tumors.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I saw those images, I knew that's
what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mara was kind enough to teach me her
method for approaching patients with
[SPEAKER_09]: tumors.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw many patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: Many patients were able to shrink their
tumors and many were able to achieve no
[SPEAKER_09]: evidence of disease.
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I saw far too many patients who
failed to respond to cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: antineoplastic therapy.
[SPEAKER_09]: About a year ago, Dr. Deti Mary gave a
talk to the Society of Cannabis Clinicians
[SPEAKER_09]: and this presentation stimulated me to
reassess the therapeutic cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: protocols that I had been using.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to mention your names now and
just sort of wave your hand to introduce
[SPEAKER_09]: yourself when I say your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you correct,
so I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was asked to moderate this panel
and select the panelists, I thought that
[SPEAKER_09]: we would learn the most by merging the
intellectual capital of the best
[SPEAKER_09]: researchers, Dr. Mary, Dr. Sanchez,
Dr. Rousseau, and clinicians, Drs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hergenrather and Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_09]: An aspect of Dr. Mary's work also dealt
with the use of various solvents,
[SPEAKER_09]: and so I wanted Dustin Mahon, the CEO and
Chief Science Officer of Endocanna Labs in
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado, to show us extraction results of
several chemovars with multiple solvents.
[SPEAKER_09]: Laboratory work that we have available in
this country, we don't have mass
[SPEAKER_09]: spectrographs as Dr. Mary has at his
disposal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Goldstein and Dr. Hergenrather will
share their experience first, hopefully
[SPEAKER_09]: speak to their failures as well as their
successes in using cannabinoids in the
[SPEAKER_09]: treatment of cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then Mr. Mahon will show us some
comparisons of various cultivars and
[SPEAKER_09]: multiple solvents.
[SPEAKER_09]: With that background, we will then begin
asking the full panel the questions
[SPEAKER_09]: detailed in the panel description.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you have those at your disposal
now, otherwise I'll be reading them as we
[SPEAKER_09]: go.
[SPEAKER_09]: The objective of the panel is to learn how
we can better apply preclinical research
[SPEAKER_09]: to improve patient outcomes.
[SPEAKER_09]: With that, if you would start,
please, Dr. Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about my experience with
mostly pediatric patients that I treat
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabinoids for cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, cancer is a term that we use
that encompasses a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Dr. Sanchez and Dr. Mary's research
shows, we can have breast cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can have colon cancer, but they're
still subtypes and they may not respond
[SPEAKER_01]: the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very difficult, complex question
when you're approaching patients that come
[SPEAKER_01]: into your office and are asking for help.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of the concerns with pediatrics is
that their same chemotherapies are being
[SPEAKER_01]: recycled over the years, very few new
treatments for these kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, unfortunately, pediatric cancer only
receives about 4% of all cancer research
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is 96% of the cancer research money
goes to adult cancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also hindering research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you that also what I'm finding
is that when parents come in with their
[SPEAKER_01]: children, one of the biggest concerns is,
my child may survive, but what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of my child's life going to be
down the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is my child going to get a secondary
malignancy from radiation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is my child going to have cognitive
impairment from chemotherapy and
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is my child going to have cardiac disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was preparing for this panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually read about a gentleman who's
doing research at University Hospital in
[SPEAKER_01]: San Antonio, who he himself is in his 40s
and he is a cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is in his 40s, has had severe
repercussions from the chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's had a cardiac arrest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's had strokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is actually studying what chemo does to
those who survive from childhood cancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says it accelerates the aging process.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've seen some research in the last
couple years about cannabis, we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: it can help actually reverse aging as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I have a patient that comes in with
cancer, of course, I go through a history
[SPEAKER_01]: physical exam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about with the family what their
goals are with cannabis therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some of them, it is just symptomatic
treatment because they're on a protocol
[SPEAKER_01]: that may give them very good survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them want to add cannabis as a
adjunct anti-neoplastic agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I often discuss both treatments with the
families.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them do opt, even if they start
with symptomatic treatment, many of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: as they see that their child's responding
really well, then they come back and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to up the dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to start giving our child more
cannabis to see if we can try to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the chances that our child's going to
survive this.
[SPEAKER_01]: With children, I use all the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the research that Dr. Mary and
Dr. Sanchez are doing is very helpful,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still to this day, we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what combinations are going
to kill which cancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we're going to discuss, I think other
panelists are going to probably say the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have found that combination treatment is
clearly the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually use five different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you heard me speak yesterday,
CBD, THC, THCA, CBDA, and CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to use as many different
preparations and also from different
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then I can be sure that they're
probably going to be grown a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to hopefully cover a lot of
the different compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I kind of look at this as
somebody comes into a hospital who's
[SPEAKER_01]: really sick and you do not know what,
let's say, you know they have an infection
[SPEAKER_01]: but you don't know what they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may send a culture and you cover them
with what we call broad spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: antibiotics until you can narrow down
what's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how I approach this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Broad spectrum using multiple different
compounds to try to see what will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start low dose and we titrate up,
of course, always concerned about side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects, if there's going to be any.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you children, because I have
taken care of adults with cancer too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Children tolerate cannabinoids way better
than adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't drive a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't go to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to make dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of go with the flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them, I will tell you,
the parents will tell me there is
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely no side effect and their child
goes from being sick on chemo or side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one patient that went down from
about 90 pounds down to 57 pounds post
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation and she's gained it all back
just from adding cannabis in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Children really tolerate cannabis well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, I am seeing just over
the last few years that more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: patients or parents are bringing their
children to me earlier in treatment rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than waiting until they've been told that
there's no other treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them want to help their child get,
of course, the best results.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's anything that you
want to add, Joe.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have a chance to weigh in later if
you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe did ask me to talk about possibly the
patients that don't respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people get to my office so late
like unfortunately had a child show up on
[SPEAKER_01]: a Wednesday and the child died Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously not enough time to be
able to intervene, although the family
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't even have time to get oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had other patients come in who
clearly it's towards the end and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think that it's going to reverse anything,
but certainly quality of life at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of life so that the child's out of pain,
maybe eating a little bit, maybe more
[SPEAKER_01]: playful, certainly makes a difference for
these families.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few cancers that I have not
got good results with.
[SPEAKER_01]: DIPG, if you've heard of that,
it's a very rare brain tumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we have not gotten very
good success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients who have leukemia seem to respond
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it also depends on the kind of
cancer in terms of response and also at
[SPEAKER_01]: what stage they are when they get to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I wanted to first thank the
organization for the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_06]: participate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wonderful to get together with our
colleagues from around the world and meet
[SPEAKER_06]: new folks in the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a cannabis doc for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started my career about 40 years ago on
a commune in Tennessee learning about
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis as medicine, but cancer wasn't
part of that at that time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't until I opened my office about
20 years ago up in Sebastopol,
[SPEAKER_06]: California that I began to see cancer
patients on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: At that point, there were somewhere in the
range of 8 to 10% of my patient population
[SPEAKER_06]: came with cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since that time, really in the last three
years, this demographic has changed
[SPEAKER_06]: drastically to where now there are about
30 to 40% of the patients that come in to
[SPEAKER_06]: see me are coming because of cancer and
mostly asking for treatment that may
[SPEAKER_06]: mitigate, may help in slowing the
progression of these tumors.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a huge difference and I think those
of you are going to see the same kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: demographic in your practices.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have seen some amazing things over the
years and some of the first ones were
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking a small amount of cannabis on a
daily basis to see a glioblastoma never
[SPEAKER_06]: recur.
[SPEAKER_06]: For nine years, I might add, before that
point that the patient stopped smoking
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and he had a full recurrence of
the tumor within a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've also seen a neuroblastoma disappear
after UCSF had given up on him and they
[SPEAKER_06]: sent him home and said, comfort care,
we don't have anything more to offer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he too, as a nine-year-old,
began to smoke a little bit of cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: for pain relief and within a couple years,
the tumor had disappeared.
[SPEAKER_06]: Malignant melanoma is another case where
I've seen them disappear.
[SPEAKER_06]: These tumors disappear in multiple
patients over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since these other tumors have had a
carcinoma, other people with glioblastoma
[SPEAKER_06]: and really multiple tumors have done well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But saying that, I also have to say the
majority of patients with cancer don't see
[SPEAKER_06]: this kind of response.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I'm not controlling for either
the cannabis or for the treatment
[SPEAKER_06]: protocol.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might advise a treatment protocol,
but I have no idea what they're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: do once they go out back to home and try
to find these products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Approaching a patient with cancer,
I think, is very important to just be as
[SPEAKER_06]: the ethical approach is to say,
look, I expect that we're going to get
[SPEAKER_06]: treatment benefits in terms of symptomatic
cures or symptomatic relief.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have a better appetite.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have some pain control.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to sleep better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mood's going to be better.
[SPEAKER_06]: The anxiety is going to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nausea and vomiting are going to be
controlled.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can expect that in most all patients
who use cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: But whether or not a tumor is going to
regress, that's a whole other thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's looking at the work of Dr. Sanchez
and Dr. Meery and others before who have
[SPEAKER_06]: really led us to say, well, it was
McAllister's work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven years ago, eight years ago,
who said, hey, THC and CBD work together
[SPEAKER_06]: better.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a synergy of these molecules.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this has led us along the way to
directing patients to at least hope that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're going to find a combination of
cannabis cannabinoids that may work best.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the least, I want symptomatic
relief.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the most, we may get lucky and be able
to treat a cancer really effectively and
[SPEAKER_06]: slow the progression or, in a rare case,
see a tumor disappear.
[SPEAKER_06]: For those patients that come to me and
they're already chronic cannabis smokers,
[SPEAKER_06]: I say, look, it doesn't really look good
because this tumor has developed in the
[SPEAKER_06]: face of a regular use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can certainly try high dose
therapy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we often do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's getting up into these gram
quantities that have kind of gotten known
[SPEAKER_06]: as the Simpson oil and that protocol of
taking a large amount of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't attest to any results for that,
but people are at least trying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also are still faced with the issue of
people come in and say, what is the best
[SPEAKER_06]: strain for me to treat this cancer?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we simply do not have that information
yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're close.
[SPEAKER_06]: As we can feel the research coming,
I know people are going to be looking for
[SPEAKER_06]: THC and CBD and CBG.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from this point on, they may also be
looking for compounds 331-18B.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that I didn't say the right one,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I'll scratch that out of my nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: So method of administration, I think,
is very interesting because we do know
[SPEAKER_06]: that a puff on cannabis has a very high
blood level for a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was the great work of Donald
Tashkin sitting in the front row who
[SPEAKER_06]: taught us that, yes, this is the best way
to treat cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does provide some injuries,
some irritation to the lung and the
[SPEAKER_06]: airways, but we're not going to be causing
COPD and emphysema and significant
[SPEAKER_06]: alterations in the pulmonary function
studies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't discourage people from smoked
or vaporized cannabis as a method of
[SPEAKER_06]: administration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, if we're going to be treating
with cannabis, we tend to look to the oral
[SPEAKER_06]: forms in order to get the big doses that
we think might be necessary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, some of these cases that did so
well earlier, 15 years ago in my career as
[SPEAKER_06]: a cannabis specialist, were very small
amounts in many cases.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I don't know if we're way
overacting to be giving gram quantities of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: We may be, but there seems to be
information that we don't really fully
[SPEAKER_06]: understand yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be markers of the tumors
that would give us some clues as to what
[SPEAKER_06]: tumors are going to respond best to what
cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dosing and frequency, this is tailored to
meet the patient's needs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really has to do with what kind of
tumor we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a slow-growing tumor and they just
want to come in and have an idea as to
[SPEAKER_06]: what to do, it may be a small dose of
cannabinoids at bedtime that's sufficient.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we want to ramp it up, we might give a
big dose of CBD in the daytime,
[SPEAKER_06]: even twice in the day, the morning and the
afternoon, and have a more sustained blood
[SPEAKER_06]: level.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you can get up into hundreds of
milligram quantities of CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rich, full plant extract cannabis oils.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they can tolerate the THC in their
product, then fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's probably a good idea until we
learn better.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for a bedtime dose, I'm really
encouraging people to use a combination of
[SPEAKER_06]: THC and the other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Acid cannabinoids, I think, are certainly
of value too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do talk about the green cannabis as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they have friends that are growing,
put those buds in a blender and have them
[SPEAKER_06]: on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they possibly can.
[SPEAKER_06]: The duration of action is different
because of these P450 cytochromes that are
[SPEAKER_06]: a little different from patient to
patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people are going to probably be
adequate with a dose a day, and others may
[SPEAKER_06]: need three doses a day in order to
optimize or maximize their cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_06]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm excited to be in the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do the best that I can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really relying on these colleagues
of mine in this field to guide us as to
[SPEAKER_06]: what might be best in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one thing to grow them in a lab
and kill cells in a laboratory on a petri
[SPEAKER_06]: dish, and quite another to be able to do
it in vivo in people that are dealing with
[SPEAKER_06]: these cancers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's more or less the way I'm
approaching cannabis therapy of cancers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll welcome the opportunity to answer
questions if they come along.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Dustin Mahon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the president, CEO, and CSO of EC Labs
in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last two years, I was out in the crowd
with you guys watching these great minds
[SPEAKER_00]: up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm so humbled right now to be up
here with this panel that words can't say
[SPEAKER_00]: enough of how thankful I am to Dr. Joe and
to all the people I can met here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has saved my life, and it has
fascinated me ever since I jumped into
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a quick experiment here to try to
help the panelists understand a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are extraction experts in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use hydrocarbon extraction and some
ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did use a lab white label to do some CO2
extractions for me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still much more research that
needs to be done from the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: on what things do what here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to focus specifically on the
cannabinoids and the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids and terpenes have shown
largely to have significant impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are far too many variables right now
to validate really a best classification
[SPEAKER_00]: for solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this experiment will provide
information on the best solvent for
[SPEAKER_00]: specific applications, like total
cannabinoid potencies or efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we have an inability to test
all of the great things that my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: here gets to test with cannabinoids and
terpenes, but it leaves us with probably
[SPEAKER_00]: more questions than we have answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as we've gotten, we really need
a lot more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the few things that we look for out of
the cannabinoid extraction or from
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction of the cannabinoid plant is
going to be efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much of the cannabinoids and the
terpenes did we pull out of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material as well as potencies?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how pure is the concentrate that we get
out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I like to look at is
the decarboxylization rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant grows in the raw acidic
cannabinoids and certain extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques actually will activate those
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the different variables that I tried to
accomplish here were going to be using a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick wash versus a soak, which is going
to be plant material on a quick wash is
[SPEAKER_00]: contacted in very minimal exposure time
trying to increase the pure impurities,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're going to sacrifice some
efficiencies versus soaking the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material where you're contacting with the
solvent for prolonged periods of time
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to pull as much of the cannabinoids
and terpenes out of the plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: but understanding that you'll probably
pull some impurities as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took two different chemovars of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the high THC strain and a high CBD
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we ran them through several
different methodologies of quick wash and
[SPEAKER_00]: soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took with five different solvents and
we had the cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: potencies tested on the starting plant
material, the concentrate as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: ending plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used propane and butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used ethanol and then we did a
subcritical and a supercritical CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the major questions that I get is
how much solvent is left over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every state in the that's legalized has
set some sort of a residual solvent level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the United States Pharmacopia set a
residual solvent level that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: have in pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm a huge fan of believing that
you should really not have any residual
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents left over in your product and I
have proven and it is possible to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: the solvents from all the different
methodologies that I've shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a quick, you know, test that we
get in Colorado from RM3.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of NDs up there I could flood your
inbox with NDs, but I think we can all
[SPEAKER_00]: agree that it's very possible to get all
your solvent out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the different cultivars I used,
the first one, this is my THC strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our alien rock candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in about 6% terpene content,
22% cannabinoid content to your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid test from the alien rock
candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my spectrum strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum is a very high CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow it out to a little over the 0.3%
THC mark, but it's used heavily in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado as a hemp strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RM3 did some testing for us and the
things that we were able to figure out,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we wanted to look at what solvent
extracts total cannabinoids with the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest potency here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the THC heavy strain, we found that
supercritical CO2 actually tested at the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest purity at 85.33%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Propane quick wash, which is, you know,
minimal soak time, which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit 83.81% and the butane quick wash at
83.59%.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the CBD strain, your propane and your
supercritical flipped, but they're pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: negligible in potencies there at 81.8 and
81.76.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the propane soak came in 81.01.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I looked at for highest
efficiency isn't necessarily how many
[SPEAKER_00]: grams you pulled out of there,
but how many milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you pulled out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So multiplying your grams by your
potencies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the heavy THC strain, we found that
the butane quick wash came in at the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest efficiency, an ethanol soak right
behind that, which again, within 0.1%,
[SPEAKER_00]: so pretty negligible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the propane quick wash came in right
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the CBD strain, we had a really,
really great extraction with the ethanol
[SPEAKER_00]: soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supercritical CO2 came in after that,
and then a butane quick wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as terpenes go, propane quick wash,
one out on both sides there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ethanol, we had a soak for THC and a
quick wash for the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the ethanol quick wash again for
THC and a butane quick wash for the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as the extraction
efficiencies, propane again, looking
[SPEAKER_00]: really good for your terpenes coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethanol and butane right behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing that I recognized in the
testing for decarboxylization rates was
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was the CO2 process that tended to
decarboxylize the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand there is specific ways
that you can run your machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran these on a very commercial,
very standard, supercritical, subcritical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that supercritical across the
board decarboxylized both THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: about 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing, though,
on the subcritical run is that your THC in
[SPEAKER_00]: your spectrum, THC jumped about 20%,
and the CBD jumped 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the THC in the CBD strain jumped
40%, but the CBD in that spectrum strain
[SPEAKER_00]: only jumped 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I theorize that it's actually the
different pressures that are extracting in
[SPEAKER_00]: that subcritical, the difference between
subcritical and supercritical being the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressures, that our subcritical hit high
enough just to activate the THC but not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to activate the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there really a best solvent?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we have shown is that each
solvent has a unique ability to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something different than its counterpart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have shown that there are some better
in others in specific categories,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've also shown that there are far
more variables in extraction that are
[SPEAKER_00]: still to be found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the fact that every body and
every cancer is unique, that a combination
[SPEAKER_00]: approach is absolutely necessary and far
more research is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we turn the screen off for now?
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that background, what I'd like to
do is ask some questions of the panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Hergenrather alluded to the ratio of
THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we know when to give more THC?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there situations where we want to give
more CBD than THC?
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we decide how much of each
cannabinoid to use?
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_08]: In a situation like that, if I were asked
that question by a patient, I would try to
[SPEAKER_08]: go to the literature and see what
Christina or Dady or Manuel Guzman has
[SPEAKER_08]: done previously that indicated that there
was a preference for a particular
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoid or whether there actually had
been combinations tried before.
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, I have the benefit of having
a large network of friends that I can ask
[SPEAKER_08]: about this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would additionally look for any
synergies that might be present in the
[SPEAKER_08]: terpenoid literature.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as we've seen, sometimes it's not so
clear.
[SPEAKER_08]: But first thing is to see what has been
done or what even might have been known
[SPEAKER_08]: historically.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what history tells us that a lot of
treatments of tumors in the past were with
[SPEAKER_08]: what appeared to be raw cannabis,
whether it would have been CBDA,
[SPEAKER_08]: predominant, or THCA dominant.
[SPEAKER_08]: As we found out in the last year from
another group in Spain, Nadal et al.,
[SPEAKER_08]: that THCA is a PPAR gamma agonist.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a nuclear receptor that affects
gene transcription and may have a very
[SPEAKER_08]: prominent role in treatment of cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that still needs to be investigated
further.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I might add that one of the techniques
that I have been attracted to is that we
[SPEAKER_09]: know from Dr. Sean McAllister's work that
CBD down regulates the ID1 gene.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the ID1 gene is associated with tumor
growth and metastasis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if searching the literature shows that
a particular tumor routinely expresses a
[SPEAKER_09]: high level of ID1, that might be a good
indication of a response.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pardon me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Your mic's breaking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: How often should the THC be taken?
[SPEAKER_09]: In my experience, it's easy to give the
majority of the THC at bedtime because the
[SPEAKER_09]: patient can sleep through the
psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_09]: But Dr. Goldstein referred me to an
article of a patient with lymphoblastic
[SPEAKER_09]: leukemia who expressed blast cells that
were not curtailed when the THC was given
[SPEAKER_09]: twice daily.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when it was given every eight hours,
the blast cells fell.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to ask the question of the
panel, how often should we give the THC?
[SPEAKER_09]: And when?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for most of my patients, again,
with children, it's a little bit easier
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're usually not losing
function that most of us would not want to
[SPEAKER_01]: give up, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: driving a car, functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the family expresses to me that they
want their child to still go to school and
[SPEAKER_01]: to function well at school, I will have
them take THC in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they get home from school and then in
the evenings.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a child who's not going to school,
which as you know, if they have cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: many of them are not attending school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually recommend THC every eight hours
along with the other oils, CBD and the raw
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I've added in CBG as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably, and I tell people this,
I'm aggressive and I often over-treat,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm terrified to under-treat,
to be perfectly honest, because again,
[SPEAKER_01]: children tolerate cannabinoids very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that really the only downside
is the cost of most families.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're getting somewhere with the
cannabinoid treatment, if we actually can
[SPEAKER_01]: get to a point where the cancer is gone,
we can back up and go to more affordable
[SPEAKER_01]: doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, much of it, if they're very
small, it doesn't cost that much to give a
[SPEAKER_01]: fair high dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, in children again,
THC, I often recommend that every eight
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a lot of clinical,
really very few clinical experience to
[SPEAKER_01]: really hang our hat on how long the
cannabinoids are going to hang around in
[SPEAKER_01]: any particular person.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Jeff's experience with patients just
smoking and getting results, certainly we
[SPEAKER_01]: know that when you inhale, it doesn't last
in your body very long and certainly not
[SPEAKER_01]: at high doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it certainly has to do a lot with the
sensitivity of the tumors as well to
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what they're taking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would concur with Dr. Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can get a patient to take a THC CBD
balanced medication in three times a day,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll encourage them to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it doesn't work into their life plans,
if they're going to pick up the kids at
[SPEAKER_06]: two in the afternoon, then take the CBD in
the morning and reserve the THC for later
[SPEAKER_06]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do encourage that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Often right from the start, in California
under the laws that we have today,
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell people right from the get go,
you need to start thinking about growing
[SPEAKER_06]: your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cost of these molecules have gotten so
expensive, they come in thinking they're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be taking a dropper full of
cannabinoids three times a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say, no, we're talking about a
bottle of an ounce bottle of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_06]: a couple of times a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cost is absolutely prohibitive in this
kind of dosing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really encourage people to talk to
friends and consider growing their own
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, multiple cultivars I think are very
important and the opportunity again to get
[SPEAKER_06]: acid cannabinoids into the mix I think
also is really valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to say something, maybe to be
the big boy on this panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the answer here was how to give
cannabis that the patient will be
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not treating the patient how the
patient to be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to kill the cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when a physician give chemotherapy is
not answering if you can drive or not
[SPEAKER_02]: drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every answer will be good as the other
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what the patient need to
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if it's accumulating the
tumor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the mice I can tell you that they
see accumulation of cannabinoids in the
[SPEAKER_02]: tumors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like stuck there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it true for patients?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need THC in the evening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need CBD in the morning?
[SPEAKER_02]: The truth is we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every answer will be as good as the
other answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christine, Sanchez and me like the
scientists we know that we cure every
[SPEAKER_02]: types of cancer in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not true for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a huge gap between killing
cells in the plate, killing tumors in the
[SPEAKER_02]: mice and treating a person and the
correlation so far that even if we learn
[SPEAKER_02]: about it in the mice we won't know how to
treat the patient before we'll do real
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trials checking this kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the truth in all these conferences
people are coming and asking what we need
[SPEAKER_02]: to give to the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all we don't know really that
it's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are assuming, we're hoping and even if
we know we don't know what to give them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth that we can't run around
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have another slide.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the slide from your most recent
paper in Nature and what you showed which
[SPEAKER_09]: is impressive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so important and I'm so thankful that
we have this.
[SPEAKER_09]: You compared 36 cultivars versus 94
cannabinoids and you can see from this top
[SPEAKER_09]: part of the chart that there are different
cannabinoids in different cultivars and
[SPEAKER_09]: they're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And
[SPEAKER_09]: also I stole this slide from your patients
out of time presentation in May and this
[SPEAKER_09]: shows six different solvents and this
confirms what Destin found.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the solvents here, the first six down
here are the same as the six across the
[SPEAKER_09]: top and here are two cultivars extracted
with six different solvents and what we
[SPEAKER_09]: can see is for example if we're looking
for CBGV we're not going to get it in this
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivar with any any solvent,
but if we take a cultivar that has that
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoid we can extract it with only
butane and carbon dioxide not with ethanol
[SPEAKER_09]: which many of the fine extracts are made
with.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for me it's pointing in the direction
of making our medicine with multiple
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivars extracted with multiple solvents
in order to get all the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now Dr. Mary showed us in his presentation
this afternoon that there were a few key
[SPEAKER_09]: compounds that were necessary to kill the
cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm wondering if you would comment on
the benefits or potential benefits or lack
[SPEAKER_09]: of benefit of making these combinations of
multiple cultivars and multiple solvents.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah I'd like to take that one initially.
[SPEAKER_08]: For me it's easy there are only two
possibilities ethanol or CO2.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have little confidence in the ability to
totally purge these other solvents many of
[SPEAKER_08]: which are toxic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally there are a lot of people out
in public that think that they can do a
[SPEAKER_08]: home extraction with butane and they blow
themselves up in the process as the story
[SPEAKER_08]: I told on Monday.
[SPEAKER_08]: The safe ones are ethanol and CO2
extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously for the latter you need some
very technical equipment but I just don't
[SPEAKER_08]: see the place for the others myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethanol is just as flammable and I've seen
very big fires of ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah I don't recommend the patients do
this at all but.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I can add something I completely
agree with Ethan and we have to keep in
[SPEAKER_03]: mind that we are talking about patients
that take this medicine on a daily basis
[SPEAKER_03]: several times a day during very prolonged
periods of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a tiny little bit of
something that is below detection limits
[SPEAKER_03]: in your sophisticated equipment but if you
accumulate that little bit of something
[SPEAKER_03]: three times a day every day for months for
years that tiny little bit becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: something important so I completely agree
with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to say it for my defense
first of all it's like hitting the expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember these figures it's a long
time ago but second this is academic work
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is not coming to treat any
patients and for sure that there are
[SPEAKER_02]: solvents there which are poison just to
showing that different solvent create
[SPEAKER_02]: different extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want nobody to treat with these
solvents patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what Christine and like the people
here said it's extremely important when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing an extract you need to think
about the solvent what is left with the
[SPEAKER_02]: patient and regarding your questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you are mixing different cultivars
you diluting compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's true that you have higher
variability but you diluting the compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: and again I don't have the answer what is
good and bad to the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know what is the action that we're
doing and what is the result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the physicians here have much
much more experience how to treat the
[SPEAKER_02]: patient so Bonnie and we don't we were far
away from knowing you know in this we're
[SPEAKER_02]: just showing the complexity and how much
we don't know but we don't have good
[SPEAKER_02]: answers I guess.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dr. Russo would you think that
combining CO2 and alcohol extracts might
[SPEAKER_09]: provide better patient outcomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Possibly but again you know I'd want to
see some evidence a rationale behind
[SPEAKER_08]: combining to get those specific
components.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say I want to say something about
fire and ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started to do extraction I looked
to find the method in PubMed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually where scientists look for
evidence and there was no good way to do
[SPEAKER_02]: the ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to YouTube's and first of all I
thought that I'm the first one that doing
[SPEAKER_02]: extra ethanol extraction without the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second the guy said the most important
thing when you're doing the extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder since you used ether in your lab
did anybody go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use ether.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may explain why the student was very
slow doing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the one of the things that
intrigued me from from Dr. Sanchez's
[SPEAKER_09]: recent paper was the lack of efficacy in
adding back the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now she she added back five terpenes two
of those in Dr. Russo's publication on on
[SPEAKER_09]: anti-neoplastic terpenes only two of the
five were designated as as anti-neoplastic
[SPEAKER_09]: linalool and alpha-humaline.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what that triggered in my mind is when
we talk about the entourage I've always
[SPEAKER_09]: thought of the entourage being the
terpenes but I'm wondering if it's not as
[SPEAKER_09]: much or more so the minor cannabinoids
that make up the full entourage and and
[SPEAKER_09]: and what I was thinking about in the
combining the the extractions from
[SPEAKER_09]: multiple cultivars and with multiple
solvents was enhancing the entourage if
[SPEAKER_09]: you had compounds that were not present in
one cultivar you could bring them into
[SPEAKER_09]: play and and and and even though it's it's
diluted if you standardized for THC and
[SPEAKER_09]: CBD it's diluted but but maybe maybe in
that that slide that the last presentation
[SPEAKER_09]: the small amount of CBGA was what made the
difference and maybe it doesn't take very
[SPEAKER_09]: much maybe it's a catalyst rather than a
than a true activator of anyway I'd
[SPEAKER_09]: appreciate your comments on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes please.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure it's an intriguing question.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things I noted when I read
Christina's paper from her group was that
[SPEAKER_08]: there was no detected limonene.
[SPEAKER_08]: Limonene actually has had observed
activity at least in vitro and in breast
[SPEAKER_08]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a study done in humans of high
dose limonene in breast cancer
[SPEAKER_08]: unfortunately didn't read out and my
impression of that was well they forgot
[SPEAKER_08]: the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah certainly when I I thought it did
relate to minor cannabinoids and again
[SPEAKER_08]: given what Christina said in relation to
my question I'm really I have a strong
[SPEAKER_08]: hunch at this point that THC is
responsible for the difference from THC
[SPEAKER_08]: alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to comment about the tear pins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all think the tear pins are
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm speaking by myself so I think the tear
pins are important but I know Ethan Maya
[SPEAKER_02]: what he's thinking and I'm quite
disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the first things that we're
doing in the lab when we see phenomenon we
[SPEAKER_02]: cut the tear pins out to see if it's
affected and except for sleep disorders
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have in mice model for sleep
disorders that we do see the tear pins
[SPEAKER_02]: important in epilepsy in the cancer models
in the other models I didn't find that
[SPEAKER_02]: they are important so every time that we
cut them out it doesn't affect the
[SPEAKER_02]: phenomena which is extremely disappointing
for me but these are the results for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again except sleep disorder I didn't
find anything that they were in the mice
[SPEAKER_02]: model and the cell model that their tear
pins was very affecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the results.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a quick question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is hemp a legitimate source of CBD in
anti-neoplastic protocols?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get the question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know if we can use hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very difficult for some patients in
Europe to get high CBD cultivars for their
[SPEAKER_09]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's virtually impossible.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do some consults from Europe or with
patients in Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also difficult in many areas in the
United States to get ACDC and other high
[SPEAKER_09]: CBD cultivars and I'm wondering but hemp
seems to be much more available and I've
[SPEAKER_09]: looked at some of the lab work on the lab
analyses of hemp extracts and there are
[SPEAKER_09]: some that do have a rich terpene profile
and have substantial amounts of CBD and
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering if that is a potential
source of CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: However I think they're going to spend a
fortune in the bargain given the kinds of
[SPEAKER_08]: prices I've seen.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know a lot of this is a byproduct of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be clear.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know there are better ways a dedicated
what we'd call drug chemovar that's rich
[SPEAKER_08]: in CBD is likely going to be preferable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus with a hemp extract so called
generally we're not talking about any
[SPEAKER_08]: significant amount of THC and for most
tumors that's a necessary component.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just thinking about the CBD component.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've seen from a lot of CBD extracts
is that in a raw CBD extract an ethanol
[SPEAKER_00]: extract if you will is that you can see
THC get into the three to five percent
[SPEAKER_00]: range on that which for some patients I've
seen some really good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen responses to that one with some
of my cancers but like you say it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to have a lot more THC but
for those people that don't have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: anything better I can't see the harm and I
think it could actually help.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so a follow up question on that is
we've heard a lot of talk about CBG and
[SPEAKER_09]: CBGA at this conference and it looks like
it is turning out to be a useful
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoid that we ought to include in
our antineoplastic protocols and would
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp be a good source of CBG and CBGA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one strain in the lab that have 17
percent CBG and without THC and CBD almost
[SPEAKER_02]: at all like 0.2 CBD 0.4 CBG and THC and
this is a very potent strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see that there are cancers that
being affected by that there is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepsy model it's affecting like there
is many models affected and again I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know if it's just the CBG but for sure
this strain is very very potent strain for
[SPEAKER_02]: many things and I believe that CBG is as
potent as THC and CBD it's usually not in
[SPEAKER_02]: high percentage but I guess again my
belief that THC and CBD is a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: covering for the others but if you
eliminate them there will be other
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids with high affinity to the
receptors and they can be very potent if
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be in the percentage of this
THC and CBD as we usually see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be that there are other what
we call minor cannabinoids that if there
[SPEAKER_02]: will be in high percentage have higher
affinity to the receptor so we call it
[SPEAKER_02]: affinity of an avidity how much it's
binding the receptors and we see that
[SPEAKER_02]: there is minor cannabinoids with very
strong activity on the receptors and just
[SPEAKER_02]: amount I believe that in the cultivar and
in the thing that people are doing we will
[SPEAKER_02]: find more and more strains that have
different cannabinoids that are expressed
[SPEAKER_02]: there is already like THCV strain with 10
and 11 percent of THCV which is extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive people think that just THC is
psychoactive THCV is also very
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive but we will see more and more
cultivars with different cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: expression and different effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already see that people think that they
can send everything to my lab in FedEx and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're right so I see a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of my work with children with
autism and families of course searching
[SPEAKER_01]: for products that might help their
children I've learned about a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG actually three CBG products available
here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of them are very very low THC so can
be sold across state lines is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: under the hemp but we've gotten them
tested at multiple labs and they one runs
[SPEAKER_01]: about 50 percent CBG with about 2 percent
CBD and I can't remember what the THC is
[SPEAKER_01]: was very very low and one of the other
ones I'm waiting on lab tests and then one
[SPEAKER_01]: is a sublingual tablet that you can get in
three milligram amounts and we've have
[SPEAKER_01]: that pending right now in a lab test so
CBG is becoming available I'm sure there's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be more products on the market if
you're interested in using it and there is
[SPEAKER_01]: some an article and maybe Joe you can
share that with people the article that
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about CBG for colon cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to I'd like to go back to
something that Jeff said about this I blew
[SPEAKER_09]: this one out too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah you can hear me now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you said that you suggested that
patients throw a couple of buds in their
[SPEAKER_09]: smoothie in the morning to get the raw
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is there is a pretty extensive
literature for the raw cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_09]: the CBG a has I think I found five
articles showing that it had benefit for
[SPEAKER_09]: breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Mary has shown some experience with
THC a and prostate cancer but in in in
[SPEAKER_09]: your slides when you when you showed that
in one of your YouTube videos it turned
[SPEAKER_09]: out that that THC a also killed the
glioblastoma cells in in in in vitro
[SPEAKER_09]: you're not next to next to the the
decarboxylated THC the THC a was the
[SPEAKER_09]: second most potent cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's also literature on CBG a and
and and there's papers on on colon cancer
[SPEAKER_09]: with with with THC a and CBG a and so I'm
wondering if we should include raw
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids in a formal way in in our
cancer protocols.
[SPEAKER_09]: So so I'm just envisioning that that since
they're not psychoactive the patient could
[SPEAKER_09]: take the the CBD and the raw cannabinoids
during the day and take a big dose of THC
[SPEAKER_09]: at bedtime and get all of get a really
full entourage of compounds to fight the
cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And and I would like to hear the the
panel's response to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Share it around.
[SPEAKER_09]: So so throwing a few buds into the blender
is a pretty good way to do it if you can't
[SPEAKER_09]: make the oil and and there's not many many
products available in the dispensary that
[SPEAKER_09]: have a full compliment of raw
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to say two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes there are cancers that being affected
by the acid form of the cannabis and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know if it's the acid form or other
treatments I didn't dissect it yet to
[SPEAKER_02]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The major cell lines that we checked were
more affected by the decarboxylated but
[SPEAKER_02]: there are a few of them in prostate cancer
is one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being highly affected by the acid
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to remember that the acid form is
the native form of the on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant not creating the seed
creating the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a logic to think that there
is a role for that you know in animal
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors if it's kind of defense or
attract the mechanism for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but they usually they are less potent
than the active form like the
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylated form that's at least three
hours old.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the patient can eat cannabis like that
it's not affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Ethan said why not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to say like you you saying
things that are more related to the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a problem of the amounts of
the plant the patient they are not paying
[SPEAKER_02]: for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not related to a price.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are paying fixed price doesn't matter
how much they are getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get 600 gram a month or two grams
a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same amount for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a problem of CBD cultivars
they can choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every girl will have at least one high
CBD cultivars and they can choose and can
[SPEAKER_02]: have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of these problems we don't have it
just we don't know what is good to give
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we know it was available for the
patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you routinely use the T.H.C.A.
[SPEAKER_09]: now with recommended to patients with
prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: My patient have four legs and a tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not I'm not a physician.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I routinely try checking it in my lab
on this the models that I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not I'm not offering patient and I'm
trying to avoid it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you know people that are
experienced and physicians should take
[SPEAKER_02]: these decisions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I make a quick comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think ultimately you know there's a
huge amount of research that has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: done including clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the biggest problems of course
is the schedule one status.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any chance you get to try to talk to
any politicians if you're if you know
[SPEAKER_01]: people we have to get it descheduled so
that we can do the research period.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in chaos where CBD is still a
schedule one drug that comes from a
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical company just recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's a schedule five.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do and then there's a patent right
on T.H.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: by the government for neuro protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet it's still a schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's utter chaos and that has to get
sorted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately having the science that
that Daddy and Christina are doing is so
[SPEAKER_01]: very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time what we're being
warned about over and over is not to take
[SPEAKER_01]: their results and then apply it to human
beings because that is not that that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: linked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the initial findings what we're
seeing is sure maybe it definitely helps
[SPEAKER_01]: in breast cancer cells in a test tube and
then also in mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again remember we're missing clinical
trials for Jeff and I that treat human
[SPEAKER_01]: beings that come into our offices we offer
the best that we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no one protocol that's going to
work for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I guess it's a mixed experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen two teenagers with the same
exact stage four osteosarcoma very similar
[SPEAKER_01]: stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: One young man the family was very
motivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took high dose oils and that young
man survived and he was diagnosed at age
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 was probably not going to make it till
his 17th birthday and he just turned 20
[SPEAKER_01]: about a month ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time I had another case
referred from the same oncologist who the
[SPEAKER_01]: family came and I gave a very similar
protocol and they just had a really hard
[SPEAKER_01]: time giving the oil whether it was
psychosocial situation or the child didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to take it and that boy died.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's you can't conclude very much
other than there is certainly a chance and
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're seeing I know Dr. Hergen rather
than I better quality of life maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: extension of life for certain patients and
certainly an ability to give somebody some
[SPEAKER_01]: hope and to move forward despite the
diagnosis of cancer and sometimes very
[SPEAKER_01]: devastating cancer diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time there is no one
magical protocol that seems to work for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody despite the fact that you may
have the same cancer or the same type of
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to remember that we're still very
early in the stages of this and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think that I'm sure a lot of people came
to this panel saying well I want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: what to take or what to recommend to my
mother in law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time what I'll tell you is
that there's no reason not to try if you
[SPEAKER_01]: if you certainly have an advanced cancer
or certainly if it doesn't look good for
[SPEAKER_05]: you because we are out of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to take one question from
the audience we'll be we can we can do
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want just to say that there is few
clinical trials in Israel that running now
[SPEAKER_02]: with the cannabis and cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is like three Rick Simpson like
there is one on glioblastoma and think
[SPEAKER_02]: this data that will come from there we
start to give better hints.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I totally agree with Bonnie that you
know you can conclude for demise and from
[SPEAKER_02]: the cell lines how to treat patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think from these research it will be
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm admired this physician that treat
the patient and take the advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: As they said it's not toxic and there is
no it's even if it's give a little hope to
[SPEAKER_02]: the patients worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for in your own way pointing
out what we don't know which I think
[SPEAKER_04]: forces us to zoom out and use more of a
systems theory approach when it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: working with patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I didn't hear and I'm wondering if
some of you could comment on would be
[SPEAKER_04]: cautious cautions or contraindications for
using cannabis in patients that say might
[SPEAKER_04]: be doing immunotherapy or based on some
animal data that just came out this month
[SPEAKER_04]: from Lopez Valero at all showing that CBD
may reduce the efficacy of temozolomide
[SPEAKER_04]: and glioma model in mice.
[SPEAKER_04]: If any of you have any cautions or
contraindications to offer I can make a
[SPEAKER_01]: comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a patient comes in of course
they're required to supply me with the
[SPEAKER_01]: list of medications that you're taking
including any chemotherapy or any new
[SPEAKER_01]: immunotherapies.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I find helpful is
that you can call a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always open to questions and if
you ask them have there been any of course
[SPEAKER_01]: drug drug interactions with anything like
CBD is usually the big one that we find
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions and for some of my patients
if they're on a medication and their
[SPEAKER_01]: oncologist wants them to take that
sometimes I'll tell them you know you can
[SPEAKER_01]: take low doses of cannabinoids to try to
mitigate side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: However it may not be in your best
interest to take high doses of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids right now if it's either
going to clear that drug out of their
[SPEAKER_01]: system quicker or actually allow that drug
to accumulate and create toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to be very careful because the
vast majority of patients that are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: in now and I'm sure Jeff can say this too
are choosing treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not coming at the last resort like
it used to be maybe about five or eight
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people that are coming in are
actually coming in fairly early and so now
[SPEAKER_01]: it's created this review of all
medications because many of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in combination therapy and
that's why it's important that especially
[SPEAKER_01]: now that there's legalization in our state
here in California that someone over 21
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't self medicate while they're on a
oncology protocol because they could
[SPEAKER_01]: actually make themselves toxic on
medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's have a round of applause for our
panel.
