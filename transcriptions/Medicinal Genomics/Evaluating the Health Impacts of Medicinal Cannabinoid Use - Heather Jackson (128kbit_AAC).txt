[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, can you hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be discussing health outcome
comparisons between epilepsy patients who
[SPEAKER_00]: use versus do not use cannabinoid therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a disclosure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recently a shareholder of CW Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I stand before you is this
little bundle of joy right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little inset picture is Zaki,
my son, on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a little 60-year-old man at the end
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had cataracts and bone loss and the
seizures returned anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a rare catastrophic form of early
childhood epilepsy called Doza syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He suffered seizures every single day most
of his life, with the exception of about
[SPEAKER_00]: eight months, 500,000 seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time he was five years old,
if you can imagine, by the time he was
[SPEAKER_00]: nine years old, he had a very severe
seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had recycled through 17
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was transitioned to receiving hospice
palliative services and we wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider using cannabis as a quality of
life measure for Zaki.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's him getting an EEG in December of
2011 with his service dog when the EEG
[SPEAKER_00]: showed seizure activity every 10 seconds
while he was awake, even seizures that we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't seeing, and two to three times
that frequency while he slept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his brain was on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's him in a tire swing race.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has used Cannabidiol, a preparation
that's a whole plant botanical extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: for over six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's pharmaceutical-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four of those six years he was
seizure-free and then puberty hit,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're kind of hanging on white-knuckled
through puberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank all of the researchers and
the scientists that are in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a complete honor to stand on this
stage and doctors like Bonnie Goldstein
[SPEAKER_00]: and Dustin Sulock who have taken the
charge to help patients when their doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have this tool in their toolkit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hat is off to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research I found on PubMed was the
light at an end of a very, very dark
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel in my family's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created the Realm of Caring Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be extremely clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are an independent 501c3 organization,
an independent nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focus on research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently enrolling in five
different studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a doctor and you're trying to
track patients, hit our booth,
[SPEAKER_00]: please.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are in the industry and
creating fabulous products, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop by, too, because everyone needs to be
putting their data in this registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do research so that we can educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We operate a call center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We field about 8,000 inquiries every
single month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been on the phone over a million
minutes counseling families who are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to use cannabis as therapy as well as
doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doctors are our third highest referral
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've figured out we're not a fringe
group to get folks to, and we're building
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we created an observational research
registry because Zaki's story is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: good story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an anecdotal story, what I call
the amazingly amazing anecdotal story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're not doing a good job of
collecting this data in a scientific way,
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking what people are actually using
that they're actually able to get out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary or order through the mail,
then I think we're doing a disservice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go over some data in our
general registry, some epilepsy data from
[SPEAKER_00]: our general registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an epilepsy-specific survey,
and then we have a prospective cohort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have these available at our booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a poster that we can email you
both on epilepsy and autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can receive this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Brett did a pretty great job of
discussing what epilepsy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to save ourself a little bit
of time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to realize, though,
that 30%, sometimes up to 40%,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do have intractable conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I'll mention is that I
believe, statistically, this still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Russo or someone else can help us
who's a neurologist, that after the third
[SPEAKER_00]: failed pharmaceutical, you have less than
a 1% chance of finding one that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think about our 14th and our
15th and our 16th and our 17th drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: that really makes me tear up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have quite a history of cannabis use
in epilepsy for thousands of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way to, of course, you guys are
aware of an FDA-approved drug for epilepsy
[SPEAKER_00]: that's cannabis-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do this in collaboration with Johns
Hopkins University and the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant saved my kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of love the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked for researchers who were very,
very well published, who had published on
[SPEAKER_00]: the harms of cannabis as well as the
benefits of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so between my two principal
investigators, they're very well
[SPEAKER_00]: published, close to 500 articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a natural history experiment
underway and an opportunity for phase four
[SPEAKER_00]: data collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're comparing health-related
outcomes of cannabis users versus
[SPEAKER_00]: non-users, which is unique about our
registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have non-users or a control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the perspectives or observational
studies that are happening in this space
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have that control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for trends in product use
and dose, outcomes by health condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're evaluating those changes over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're evaluating the changes in
those who did a baseline survey who were
[SPEAKER_00]: not using cannabis as therapy and then
began using cannabis as therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the richest data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to orientate you to these
graphs real quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on your left-hand side is always going
to be cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right-hand side is non-users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our p-value or our statistical
significance I've highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're emboldened there in dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all patient demographics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This data set was locked at about two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been collecting this data over
two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was locked at about two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's 1,400 people in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are statistically significantly
older, no real statistical significance in
[SPEAKER_00]: race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're more educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that great?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't expect to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All patient outcome comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is the larger registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing quality of life statistically
significantly improved along with health
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Children are sleeping better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adults are sleeping better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anxiety is reduced and depression is
reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hear these anecdotal stories in the
call center all of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be able to gather the data,
use validated measures, go through the IRB
[SPEAKER_00]: process, and have Johns Hopkins
statisticians spit out this is wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see the medications show up yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see that in a later slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the primary medical conditions
that are in the overall registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're serving mostly folks with
neurological disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's due to a lot of the national
media we've been able to garner over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first CNN special in 2013 and the
national story has been told in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen our demographics change quite
significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, back in 2013, all pediatric,
89% in all catastrophic epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now serving 65% adults and 35%
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chronic pain is a very large diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in our adult population,
that's just surpassed in our 50,000
[SPEAKER_00]: families that we serve, pain is the
highest that people call into the call
[SPEAKER_00]: center with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see some of the other
disorders there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All where there's strong mechanisms of
action to indicate cannabinoid use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the epilepsy patient
demographics and this is 397, so 400
[SPEAKER_00]: participants in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are slightly older.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other than that, the demographics
don't really show any statistical
[SPEAKER_00]: significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a wide variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many, many different diagnoses and
seizure types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 40 different seizure types and
diagnoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet
syndrome, Doza syndrome, which is what my
[SPEAKER_00]: son has, a cardiac epilepsy as a result of
traumatic brain injury, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or brain malformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a lot of different diagnoses
represented in the registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at cannabinoid therapy
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vast majority of people are using a
high CBD product, 38%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some that are using a THC
product only, 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the doctors who are
taking care of patients in this area,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously see that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pleasantly surprised by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a wonderful neurologist who did
everything that he could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did everything that he could for my
son.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, he made the first, he was the
first neurologist to make a recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: back in 2012 for Zaki for our state's
cannabis license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you go to a doctor that's not
practicing, who might just have a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did everything that he could.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this registry, 23% did not have
doctor's recommendations and 22% did.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at, I think doctors
are concerned about folks just starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: use weed and not using drugs, specifically
an epilepsy that actually works 70% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not finding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finding most people are turning to
this as a last resort, 34%, and using it
[SPEAKER_00]: as an adjunct therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're adding it to their
pharmaceutical regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very small percentage, only 4% are using
this as front line medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 12% are using it as second line
medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little girl named Melody.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a Cardi syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, a Cardi has a very poor
outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they generally don't walk and talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often they need feeding tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a video of Melody who has sight
words, who's learned her alphabet.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's starting kindergarten, she's
dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was their second line therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried Depakote and then they turned
right to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm excited about,
elated about, is that people are turning
[SPEAKER_00]: to this sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to wait a decade like we
did, where health outcomes are
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly affected for the rest of
their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CHI will probably be dependent on us
into adulthood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got to figure that out
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually really excited that people
are turning to this as medicine sooner
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I did pull out the CW hemp
use was because 61% of the epilepsy
[SPEAKER_00]: population were using some sort of product
from CW.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's a regimated product,
we're able to see exactly how many
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to give you some variances in
dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you attended the CME course yesterday,
you learned that there's this really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really wide range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you turn these into milligrams,
this is seven milligrams a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 600 milligrams a day of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average is two milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's three milligrams per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is really important for
doctors to recognize, because if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at double-blind placebo-controlled
trials to give dosing for a whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical extract, those don't match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think they start at the dialects
at five milligrams per kilogram,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're seeing 20 or 25 milligrams per
kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important to recognize
there's quite a dosing disparagement
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, of course, are using many
different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are very difficult to figure out how
many milligrams they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a high THC, cannabis flowers,
the top one, 14 users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they would use 14 joints per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, that's really difficult to
figure out how many milligrams they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people are accessing what works for
them, which is, I think, frustrating for
[SPEAKER_00]: people, but incredibly empowering to
people like me, who I appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: for its role, but it was a big ball and
chain for my family and I, with very
[SPEAKER_00]: severe side effects for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the individualized medicine piece kind
of scares people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice part is this is individualized
medicine, and you can figure out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So health characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see health satisfaction statistically
significantly improved, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: children sleeping better and adults
sleeping better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anxiety is clinically improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not statistically significantly
improved in this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then depression is also statistically
significantly improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we don't see prescriptions show
up quite yet, but we do in a future slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthcare service utilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is economic data to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're on less pharmaceuticals,
if they're going to the doctor less,
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency room visits and
hospitalizations, that's a financial
[SPEAKER_00]: burden, often to Medicaid, because a lot
of the families we serve have
[SPEAKER_00]: disabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're seeing less outpatient
visits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing less emergency room visits
and less hospital admissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a few less sick days too,
although not statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a relatively small,
and it's 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that large registry, we have an
epilepsy specific survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to get more people completing
this additional survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hospital visits are down, both seizure
related, outpatient visits, ER visits,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hospital admissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the seizure activity is down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 42 seizures about to 16 seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the length of the seizure is
decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about three minutes and 40 seconds
to about less than two and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clinically significant, certainly if
you've ever held a loved one who's having
[SPEAKER_00]: a seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five of these 24 reported no seizure
activity in the past month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the 29 non-users who have to initiated
use, quality of life shows up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Health satisfaction, statistically
significantly improved, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: children's sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anxiety, statistically significantly
improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depression is off the charts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see prescription medications,
about 25% reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the counter medications are
statistically significantly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when asked, 275 respondents,
this is free text.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can just, it's quantitative data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can just type it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were asked how has therapeutic use of
cannabinoids helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: 275 respondents just typed things in.
[SPEAKER_00]: 52% reported reduction in seizure
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18% reported an improvement in cognition,
which we've heard from earlier speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: 13% reported improved mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 12% reported a reduction in their
seizure duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: When asked about harms caused or problems
associated with cannabinoid use,
[SPEAKER_00]: 64% typed in, hey, we're not having any
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a small percentage of folks
that are having issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4% reported increased seizure frequency,
usually at initiation or at the time of a
[SPEAKER_00]: dose increase, which can level out.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4% reported a problem with cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3% reported consequences with legality or
concerns with legality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 2%, so a very small side effect
profile GI release, related issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling foggy or tired, interactions with
their anti-epileptic drugs, or the stigma
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with cannabis, which
unfortunately still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, this observational study
was conducted with a diverse group of
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis therapy users scored better on
most health-related outcomes measured,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared with a demographically similar
control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outcomes replicated and were corroborated
by the prospective study of a subgroup,
[SPEAKER_00]: who were controls at baseline and then
initiated use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always a little checkbox for us
to take a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD products were used by the majority of
these folks, often as a last treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many cases of substantial positive
clinical and quality of life impact for
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, which is what our world
revolves around at Realm of Caring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adverse consequences are rare,
but they do certainly present in a subset
[SPEAKER_00]: of participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's important to look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we definitely need a larger sample
group for more subgroup analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to just pull out Dervain.
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: To just pull out Doza syndrome,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some limitations I definitely want to
discuss is that there are a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so dose calculation is fairly
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a convenient sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: There certainly could be some bias in
reporting that should be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data is limited to self-report,
either of themselves or of a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be a lack of objective
assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a true strength of the study
is that we're asking for a report of
[SPEAKER_00]: current status.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to minimize recall bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's really no incentive for them
to lie on the survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly label accuracy is also an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a special thanks to my principal
investigator, Ryan Vandrie, Marcel von
[SPEAKER_00]: Miller, Aaron and Nick, Joel from my team,
my entire team at Realm of Caring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a booth, so please come check
us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the participants who supported this
body of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lest we forget, this isn't about
cannabis, it's about community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
