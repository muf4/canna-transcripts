[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_01]: puts on the CanMed conference every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Head over to canmedevents.com now to learn
all about our CanMed 2021 events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just last week, we added new presenters
and panels to our schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also rearranged the order of some of
our presentations and panels so that each
[SPEAKER_01]: of our focus areas gets a dedicated time
to shine on our main stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you're at canmedevents.com,
don't forget to purchase your CanMed 2021
[SPEAKER_01]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the early bird deadline has come
and gone, you can still save by purchasing
[SPEAKER_01]: your tickets in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, you can check something off your
to-do list, and that's always a good
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if September can't come soon enough
for you, we do have a few things that can
[SPEAKER_01]: hold you over in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_01]: First is our CanMed archive, which is a
searchable video library of all the past
[SPEAKER_01]: CanMed presentations and panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find the CanMed archive on
canmedevents.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just click the banner on our homepage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the CanMed Community Facebook
group, where you can interact with other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science enthusiasts who share
relevant articles, papers, videos,
[SPEAKER_01]: photos, memes, podcasts, you know,
all the stuff you love about Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Facebook and search CanMed Community
to join the group or use the link in the
[SPEAKER_01]: show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to remind everyone that the
healthcare provider study we are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Cannabis Center of Excellence is
still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a healthcare provider,
please take a few minutes to complete the
[SPEAKER_01]: survey to help us better understand
medical cannabis knowledge, attitudes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and practices among healthcare providers
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an added incentive, one lucky
participant will win a CanMed 2021
[SPEAKER_01]: practicum and full conference ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: The link to access that survey is in the
show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this episode, we welcome Big Mike
Stramaitis, CEO of Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1983, Big Mike has worked tirelessly
to find new ways to bring cannabis to its
[SPEAKER_01]: true genetic potential, both legally and
illegally.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's overseen the cultivation of over a
million pot plants over the course of his
[SPEAKER_01]: career.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1999, Big Mike founded Advanced
Nutrients, the first fertilizer company
[SPEAKER_01]: with products specifically designed for
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, Advanced Nutrients is the number
one selling hydroponic nutrient company
[SPEAKER_01]: and the cannabis industry's most
profitable company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Mike and Advanced Nutrients are
longtime supporters of CanMed,
[SPEAKER_01]: dating back to our very first event in
2016 at Harvard Medical School.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're excited to have Advanced Nutrients
as a CanMed 2021 partner, providing
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance and assistance on planning our
cultivation focus area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Mike and I discuss how we got started
in the black market cannabis industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: transitioned to the legitimate force in
the legal industry, how nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements for cannabis are different
from other flowering plants, the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between primary and secondary
nutrients and how they help improve
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis yield, how nutrient requirements
change according to growth media and
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, some common mistakes home
growers, like myself, often make,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Big Mike drops a major announcement
about a new Advanced Nutrients product
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to that conversation,
I would like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, big surprise, Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Founded in 1999, Advanced Nutrients was
the first to develop a complete nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: system that unlocks the true genetic
potential of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since its inception, the brand has
introduced more than 50 innovations to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation community and continues to
revolutionize the space through
[SPEAKER_01]: proprietary scientific discoveries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their most recent innovation, Advanced
Hemp, is the first all-in-one fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: that is backed by 20 years of science and
specifically formulated to assist growers
[SPEAKER_01]: who are looking to yield higher CBD
counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: For more information, visit
advancednutrients.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Big Mike Stramaitis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Big Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Ben, glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are an expert on nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a lot of questions for you about
how different nutrients help cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp plants reach their full potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I want to talk with you about how
you got into the industry because you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been very open in the past in the fact
that you were growing cannabis since
[SPEAKER_01]: before it was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get started in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the dark ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing it for 38 years since I've
been 23 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had two salesmen working for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lawn care company where I had to
mix these big tanks full of chemicals and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you sprayed it on the grass and you
made the grass green and kill all the
[SPEAKER_00]: dandelions and weeds and crabgrass and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would go into these rooms and
they would go, you know, we can make
[SPEAKER_00]: $100,000 in a room this size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then be another room and they'd show me
and they go, well, we can make half a
[SPEAKER_00]: million, 300,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, this sounds illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, well, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, you're not ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to tell you yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day they invite me over to
their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, come here for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take me down to the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They open a door and this is 1983.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, you know, there's not a lot of
information about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, they didn't even exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a couple of metal halide
lights and some plants, some gangly
[SPEAKER_00]: looking plants underneath there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is we can make money growing
marijuana indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's totally safe and gave
me the spiel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, well, one thing is we don't know
how to take cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we read about how you can replicate a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to the library, looked up some
stuff, found this thing called the
[SPEAKER_00]: floating broth method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically it's where you use a
auctions in a liquid solution and you make
[SPEAKER_00]: a hole in a piece of styrofoam and you put
the kind of the sum of the cutting through
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just kind of floats in the broth
and lo and behold, it grew roots that
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I was a genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're off to a races and running and
then started growing cannabis indoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biggest challenge I found was I've
talked to a few other growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, you know, all this stuff that we buy
from these companies, do you think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all often wondered that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, we should be making things
specifically for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, well, how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, I understand fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just started playing around with
different things and eventually made some
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations that really worked well
before I was able to use science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, people were just saying that
this stuff works really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I went to Canada,
I was able to work with UBC University.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an arm called BC Research at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And BCIT, BCIT was able to have license to
take in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And UBC Research had the ability to check
for the different micronutrients that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took multiple strains, root samples,
stock samples, leaf samples, bud samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it all and looked at it and figured
out quite a bit about the plant very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was about 2003 when that
happened, when I was able to start
[SPEAKER_00]: actually using science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spent a lot of time in the UBC
University Research Library, just studying
[SPEAKER_00]: all the leading cutting edge, you know,
plant articles that were out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found this group called the Plant
Growth Regulation Society of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lo and behold, 150 to 200 of the top
scientists, plant growth scientists go
[SPEAKER_00]: there every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys from like Texas A&M and Max Plant and
Syngenta and Cargill and even Monsanto
[SPEAKER_00]: guys were there and started talking to all
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went to all the lectures, the seminars for
years and years and years, learned a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about what can accelerate plant growth and
give you a bigger plant with higher yield
[SPEAKER_00]: and more THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two things that we were
interested in at the time because the
[SPEAKER_00]: science of cannabis hadn't evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually I said, well,
I want to take this a step further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started looking, where can I find a
country or someplace so I can do this at a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger scale legally?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time in Canada, they had just come
with the laws back when I was doing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: started researching in probably about
2000, 2001, it was becoming federally
[SPEAKER_00]: legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working with a bunch of cancer
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, where can we go to like
an actual lab environment where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: better controls?
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, a country of Bulgaria
said they were willing to issue a license,
[SPEAKER_00]: had to go through six ministries to get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to study it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our walls or concrete walls are two and a
half feet thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to put cameras in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let us have one kilo of material,
whether it was flour or an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were allowed one kilo and the rest we
had to incinerate and they would watch us
[SPEAKER_00]: incinerate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the backstory of how,
you know, it all began.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's a plethora of products
because of that research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's quite the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting to hear that you
actually sort of started with the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: side before you even got into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you were using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always have been in the grass business
since I've been 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, it was called Turf Pro was the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started when I was 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you mentioned that the nutrients
you were using before you sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: formulated something that was specific for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was, what was that like?
[SPEAKER_01]: How far have nutrients come?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, it was like a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if she's just saying it,
but it was Peters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using, we used a bunch of
different companies and they treated it
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was a normal flowering plant with
a lot of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we knew, I knew right away that this
plant does not like phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: does not use hardly any phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it uses probably about 75 to 80%
less amounts of phosphorus than it does
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I see fertilizers and any of
these people listening who are a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you see a high phosphorus number,
stay away from that fertilizer because
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metal, heavy metals are contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them in the phosphorus and also
in humic acids, you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I saw a lot of cancer
patients where we're using the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, heavy metals has got to be
a, is going to be a concern at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really went after the reducing the
heavy metals right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you smoke a one gram joint of
cannabis grown with advanced nutrients at
[SPEAKER_00]: the, in regards to heavy metal toxicity,
it's no more than 50 drops of drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's pretty, pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, let's, so let's talk nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, primary nutrients are nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got your, your
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does the plant use these nutrients
and, and, you know, throughout its life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis actually uses more nitrogen
and potassium during the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: More this right manganese and iron during
the, uh, during the flowering stage and
[SPEAKER_00]: less zinc during the veg stage actually
uses more zinc during the flowering stage
[SPEAKER_00]: and uses a smidge more boron in,
uh, in, in the, uh, the vegetative state
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, there is a shift in the plant
and how it uses micronutrients and also
[SPEAKER_00]: how it uses, uh, the macros and
secondaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say that it, you,
campus uses a lot of iron actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I always sometimes liken it to the,
uh, secondary nutrients like calcium or
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, but it's, it's not quite up
there, but it does use a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, that's important if you,
if you're growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it will bind to cocoa just like
calcium magnesium will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to, you have to pump up the
calcium magnesium and the iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see these mixes there are cow
mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have iron in them,
get one that has iron in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned that, you know,
different mediums require different
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, what about the other soil
peat moss, things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's different considerations there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, soil course, you know, the pH of soils
can, can vary in a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so can the nutrients and the type of,
of, of, of, you know, soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is a bit gets more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to look at your water source,
uh, as well as your soil source,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then make a mathematical equation out
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, Pete, Pete's easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two new products coming out with
rogue soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, by the way, big announcement that
we'll talk about that later on,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, coming, coming out, uh, and none of
them have a fertilizer charge to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a 60% peat, uh, peat moss and 40%
perlite and the other ones, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% cocoa and 40% a perlite one,
uh, called cocoa cowboy and pistol Pete
[SPEAKER_00]: and pistols P I S T I L.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you mentioned that soil has a
lot of, uh, things you need to consider,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's pH and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a home grower, a hobbyist grower,
what do you kind of suggest in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: using a, uh, yeah, look, if you're going
to grow in, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is an acid loving plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is you want to keep
the rise of sphere in, in a negative pH or
[SPEAKER_00]: below seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, ideally you want to keep it between
five point, five point six to six point
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fertilizers that we provide the
growers are high in cations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why cations are not anions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you actually take the root system
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you turn it into a pH lowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it helps you lower the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots exude, uh, a substance that
drops the pH in the rises fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are fertilizer actually helps
the plant do what it likes rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of fertilizers out there
that are high in anions and that produces
[SPEAKER_00]: an alkaline rises fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, uh, an acid rises here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you saying that your nutrients kind
of help the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does help the plant helps the plant
do what, what, what it likes the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we use the plant to get better yields
because we give it what it was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to come back to this home
advice for home growers, because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: tried it myself with varying degrees of
success, but I know that advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients has put together a lot of
resources to help novice home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we're going to speak a bit to that
and then maybe talk about some of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: common mistakes that home growers make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a, a grower support.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things with our product,
you can call up and you can actually talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we've always talked about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a great grower support is open
24 hours a day now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, probably the easiest substance to
grow in is, uh, is peat moss and perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, the most forgiving,
I would say it has some good pH buffering
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as much as good, you know,
the soil has, but it has adequate pH
[SPEAKER_00]: buffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also, when we build our products,
we use a lot of chelates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use EDTA, EDDHA, DPTA and glycinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has it, we have, we save
growers from themselves because of these
[SPEAKER_00]: group on the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't want to see them lose a
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So theoretically our absorption of our
micronutrients, which are really critical
[SPEAKER_00]: is from a pH of one to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know that the plant's going to
start dying off at pH 2.5 and 9.5 on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we design it to, even if you go out of
the pH, the sweet spot of 5.6 to 6.3,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're still going to pull off a crop and
be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to save the growers from the
mistakes that they make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biggest mistakes that growers make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment is number two, and they make a
lot of mistakes in the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best temperature that you can have
would be 76 degrees at 40% humidity across
[SPEAKER_00]: the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains obviously are different,
but for the most part, that'll give me
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you want to watch, uh, vapor,
you know, BPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, vapor pressure deficit, uh,
and there's a cheap down and dirty way of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure your nighttime temperatures
are about 10 degrees lower than your
[SPEAKER_00]: daytime temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right now that kind of, you know,
tell you when the stomata is open and when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm writing all this down for the next
time I, I try to do my indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and what about, you know, what about
overfeeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're in the nutrient business,
but do you, do you ever find that's home
[SPEAKER_01]: growers are just using way too much
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell when the, when the plant
is a really super rich, rich, rich,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark green, almost iridescent kind of dark
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like, that's at the maximum
place you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course you're going to see,
you know, a little bit of the tip burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see the tip burning,
you know, back off of the nutrients and a
[SPEAKER_00]: good rule of thumb is about a thousand to
1400 parts per million in the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, you know, there's just a lot of
myths, uh, out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the myths that are, you want to
match your CO2 levels to the PPM that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is absolutely just nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 1500 parts per million is the most the
plant can absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried 2000, 3000, by the way,
a little trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to kill off all the bugs and
insects, 10,000 parts per million of a CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: NASA, that's one of the tricks NASA does
for bug control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we did touch on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, growing in soil, what about
growing indoor versus growing outdoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there different considerations there
in terms of nutrients too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, growing mediums, uh, you know,
the plants, the plant you, you,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is, uh, if you're in soil,
it's going to be, you know, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a different amount of fertilizer that
you're going to put on versus what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to put on depending on the strain
when you're growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you the future of genetics,
you will be able to grow outdoor plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that will look like indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason indoor plants actually look the
way they do is because they're not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what they're looking, what,
what they really want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think another big thing with outdoor and
you telling me if I'm on the right track
[SPEAKER_01]: here will be, um, auto flower or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've mapped out the, you know,
some rural rarellas plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where the mechanism is,
uh, in the future genetics, you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, that's what you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a lot of auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you're starting to see more and
more auto flower, but what, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: understand where the mechanism is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take that mechanism and you can
stick it into any strain that you want and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll become an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be a big deal in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can get multiple harvests in a
single growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go back to research because that
was a big part of, um, what, what made
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced nutrients, what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you could speak a bit
more to, um, sort of the advancements that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've made at advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of things that we found out,
because I was a member of the plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation society of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of so-called tricks that you
can do, uh, with, with hormones,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, to really get a bigger, you know,
found a robust plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can think of, uh, taking,
uh, if you think of the incredible Hulk,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you can, uh, uh, not though,
not the Hulk that was as big as the
[SPEAKER_00]: skyscraper, but you know, the one with
Bill Bixby, I think it was, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was Lou Ferrigno and,
and really gets thicker stocks and put on
[SPEAKER_00]: more weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we did a lot of that research and a
lot of that, you know, would have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: put through the EPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we have products for hemp
that we're putting through the EPA that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, are, are, have hormones in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a multitude of things that we
understand about that plant when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, optimizing different
characteristics that you'll be seeing over
[SPEAKER_00]: the next few years, uh, coming,
us coming out with first for hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's readily illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to get an EPA
registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's say the THC side yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's coming three, four years away
and we're ready for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you've already launched,
um, advanced hemp, a line that's targeted
[SPEAKER_01]: at hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I believe the product you have out
now is, you know, is to help with.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wondering if you could explain a bit
how, how that does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's that it's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not just like one particular
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way that we build a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say our product is a belt,
best built fertilizer product in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace because of the extents that we
go to, to bring in the raw materials that
[SPEAKER_00]: are ultra pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to, I'm just going to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make, I'm going to make an exclusive
for you right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, uh, hypha chemicals has been
one of our secrets for 18 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been having a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have taken a step further and,
uh, we have a very strict, we're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategic partnership with hypha
chemicals, with rogue soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a partnership, uh, for soil and,
uh, we'd also just acquired to sorrow
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, uh, out of the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they were one of the bigger players
along with HGH and, uh, they have some
[SPEAKER_00]: very cool tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be coming out with a plant with zero
THC and a high amount of, uh, CBD and that
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll have that in our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gene edited plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll have it, uh, supposed to have it
in our hands this November.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some other things coming down
the pike as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, very low THC to no THC
producing high amounts of THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on as, as, as we're
speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited about, about that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting into the seed game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely are like for the future for
advanced nutrients is matching strains
[SPEAKER_00]: with specific protocols for fertilizer and
producing an SOP and going to whoever it
[SPEAKER_00]: is that wants to say, here's this,
here's the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you want your genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want tissue cultures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want, you know, clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how you, here's how you take care
of that plan, whether it's indoors or it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like deprivation or whether it's in soil,
here's what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and I think you said that you're
partnering with a soil company as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to provide the medium as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're vertically integrated at the
front of the value chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what my goal was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have achieved that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be some more announcements
coming out in the future with some other
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that we're working with out of
the ag space.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to genetics, we have some
exclusive arrangements coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're excited about those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will, and then with those
acquisitions, it just rounds out our
[SPEAKER_00]: portfolio very nicely at the front of the
value chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I understand it, so you're focusing
on hemp now, probably for obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously to me it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, so like we have tricks to the
trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say that we will be putting
through the EPA if you want to do fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: production, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I'm excited about
that we were now looking into is hemp for
[SPEAKER_00]: protein production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never looked at that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that we're really looking at
because we realized that it is a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very good, uh, a protein source and,
uh, you know, better than wheat and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, doesn't have the gluten
problem that wheat has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I bring it up a lot on, on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like, you know, so much of
the hemp industry is so focused on CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, but they are in CBG too as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the potential for fiber, I think is
just huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one's really tapped into that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, we're looking at, we have a product
like we're putting through the EPA that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we'll, we'll make, I mean,
cannabis is a fast growing plan already,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to grow like Jack and the
beanstalk and we'll really get that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: taller, better, and, uh, and much quicker
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, we talked about how you're
focusing on hemp broadly because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: legality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to kind of maybe come back to
the whole legality part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you got started,
obviously cannabis very much in the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're sort of in the gray market
with, you know, now there's legislation
[SPEAKER_01]: being proposed to make it federally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what's that been like seeing it happen
like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, I can remember my brother
and I, 17 years ago, we're, we're trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go one day, this is going to be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, you think so?
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about probably about 20, 20 years or
so it's, it's going to be illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was 17 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember he reminded me of that
conversation and my brother was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the meantime, we just keep trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, sure enough, I just, I could
just, I just knew it was only a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: time that it was going to be legal,
especially when I saw pop two 15 coming
[SPEAKER_00]: through, coming through California and it
becoming federally medical marijuana was
[SPEAKER_00]: federally legal in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said the door has been kicked open and
it's just timing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, people used to always ask you,
when do you think it's going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: federal legal in the U S my answer was
when we got 30 to 35 States, we're there
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, it's, it's fortunately
Joe Biden, you know, he first said that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, he was against it and they
go, Joe, you can't say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get both.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, okay, I'm for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's backpedaling and saying that
he's, he's not for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guess is he's going to use it for
probably the 2024 election.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll probably see it federally
legalized in 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, look, there's bills being pushed
through all the time from different,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Democrats, Republicans,
and basically they're fighting over who's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the first two and can claim
that they've legalized it federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I would just stop and,
and just, you know, let's just get down to
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know it's going to be federally
legal at some point, especially because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now they're printing
trillions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inflationary as we're seeing,
and we're going to go to a, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably we're going to go to a huge
economic downturn, but to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're probably done.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us have seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to need the tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already proposed a 5%,
uh, you know, federal tax on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish they would just go ahead and do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just get on with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I would imagine you guys are well
positioned for that day when that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I put in some things through hemp
that can be used, you know, can be,
[SPEAKER_00]: will we immediately be able to be switched
over to the, uh, to the, uh, the THC side
[SPEAKER_00]: because cannabis is cannabis and,
uh, you know, that's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to talk about CanMed because,
Oh, man, that's the one of the most,
[SPEAKER_00]: the single most probably important for,
for, for my, from, from, from my aspect,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the way I see it, the single most
important conference that cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, MJ business is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to see all the stuff that you can
use and the trimmers, but I've always been
[SPEAKER_00]: science driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advanced nutrients has always been science
driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the genetics is science driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, science is, is, is everything when it
comes to growing any kind of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the fact that, uh, this is,
you know, just all about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there for the first time you guys
had it in Harvard, but it was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: supporter then as I am now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if you're in the cannabis space,
as important as MJ biz is to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be going to CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and we, we very much appreciate the
support and we're thrilled to have,
[SPEAKER_01]: of you and advanced nutrients as a partner
level sponsor, um, and helping us build
[SPEAKER_01]: out the cultivation focus area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be, um, it's going
to be a real standout at this year's
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in fact that you're really putting
an emphasis on, on cultivation this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to get a lot of the growers
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The master growers, uh, people in general,
even if you're a home grower, you should
[SPEAKER_00]: come there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have some, uh, some
displays up there that explain things and
[SPEAKER_00]: help things to, uh, doesn't matter what
level you're at, whether you're the home
[SPEAKER_00]: hobbyist or you're the master grower for
some, you know, MSO, you will learn
[SPEAKER_00]: something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So winding down here, I did also want to
ask you about your, um, your humanitarian
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts, uh, through humanity heroes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to that, because it's great work
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe at advanced nutrients,
if a company is successful, they should
[SPEAKER_00]: give back directly to the community in
which they give them their money and
[SPEAKER_00]: society as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, recently we're the island of St.
Vincent was highly impacted by this
[SPEAKER_00]: volcano that erupted and killed all the
outdoor cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went, we donated a hundred thousand
dollars worth of nutrients to the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: of, of St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also brought down our support people so
they could learn different techniques and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow better, better crops as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, with the wildfires were raging last
year, we gave away $250,000 of advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and $250,000 in cash the year
before we gave, uh, 2017 it was a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand in cash to, to, to growers that
the help about, that's how we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, you know, help direct, go get back
directly to our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also we go and we're very active
on Skid Row down in Los, uh, down here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we give out backpacks that are full of
necessities that make life easier for the
[SPEAKER_00]: people on Skid Row.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even give out bags of dog food for the
dogs that are down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we've been down there multiple
times, uh, handing out the, the backpacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: During COVID we actually had hygiene packs
that we handed out, uh, down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, we're, you know, during the worst
of the pandemic, you know, our,
[SPEAKER_00]: our team members were down there helping
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, humanity heroes is, is a,
you know, something that's very close to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I wish more companies would,
uh, would, would, you know, start their
[SPEAKER_00]: own charity or give to charities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it's, it's great work and
really speaks to, uh, speaks to you and
[SPEAKER_01]: speaks to the company that you're,
you're giving back like that definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: aligns with that, with our values here at
Can Med and medicinal genomics as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess winding down here, I wanted to
give you the opportunity to, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: to plug any social media websites or
anything that people can keep up with you
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can go to Instagram and you
can go, you can type in advanced nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and, and find out more about
advanced nutrients that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to advanced nutrients.com or just,
if you want to go to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: planet big Mike, we call it, you just go
to Instagram and type in big Mike,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that will open up the whole world of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're into, not just fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Mike, thank you again so much for the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to seeing you out in
Pasadena for Can Med.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to meeting Ben.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoy my conversation with big
Mike.
