[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got the backdrop for our body's
endocannabinoid system, a self-healing,
[SPEAKER_00]: self-regulatory system, this concept of
network pharmacology, complex
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions, and hopefully letting go of
some of the need to understand all that
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity in a reductionistic way,
but feeling a little more comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: zooming out and understanding that the
future of medicine and the past may be
[SPEAKER_00]: these complex botanical medicines used
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really believe and am seeing now
that cannabis is the gateway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is leading medicine back to
greater comfort with a botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, greater comfort with
multi-constituent treatment, and levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity that we don't fully understand
yet are comfortable enough with because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the safety profile to use in our patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dig into cannabis, or actually
specifically cannabinoid pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following lecture will address the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we have the flower,
the compound flower of cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we zoom in a little bit more,
we see the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are resin glands present on the
little flowering structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where all the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are factories of dozens,
hundreds of compounds that have
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just zooming in, the things that
we're focused most on would be the THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, as Dr. Mishulam pointed out
this morning, very low levels of THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD are found in the raw cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the THCA and the CBDA,
the acidic forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that little carboxylic
acid moiety on the molecules there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were considered the inactive
forms of these compounds for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now they're starting to gain some
recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, raw or very slightly heated
preparations of cannabis have been used in
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to dig into THC and CBD
first, and then we'll take a tour of some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other cannabinoid compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC is a partial agonist at the CB1 and
CB2 receptor, much like anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC very closely mimics the activity of
our endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably the biggest difference is
that when someone is exposed to THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: this exogenous phytocannabinoid,
they end up with a global cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be distributed into all the
tissues and affect them systemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to try to get this a little
closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to when our bodies make
anandamide, it's done in a very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: manner, and it has very short-term
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the effects of THC, analgesic,
antipyridic, bronchodilatory,
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory,
anti-emetic, and then, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: the psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just to name a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really anything that CB1 and CB2 can do,
THC can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's probably the most clinically
relevant function of THC, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people aren't aware that THC is
extraordinarily active or promiscuous,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you would say, at other targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how relevant some of these
targets are, but THC activates two other
[SPEAKER_00]: G-protein couple receptors that are at
least peripherally involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 18 and 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: P power gamma, TRIP A1, TRIP V2,
TRIP V3, and TRIP V4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, notice the absence of TRIP V1,
which is the capsaicin receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but THC is actually active at other
receptors in this vanilloid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then THC has some receptor inhibition
activity as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these show up mostly in in vitro
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how clinically relevant they
are, but probably some of them are in some
[SPEAKER_00]: situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC also has a lot of effects,
actually, enhancing or decreasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of various enzymes throughout the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not really sure how clinically
relevant, but I like to point out what we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know, because I think that helps us
prevent ourselves from assuming we know
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on with just THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is also inhibiting or enhancing
transporters of various neurotrans...
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can see there, adenosine,
dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the transport of these from the
synapse back into the cell can be enhanced
[SPEAKER_00]: or inhibited by THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on there with THC,
although it's probably mostly this partial
[SPEAKER_00]: agonist effect of CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, CBD is quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of overlap with THC in its
clinical effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both can help with pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both can help with anxiety, with
inflammation, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting that CBD does not
directly act upon the main targets of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has very low affinity for those
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it acts as a non-competitive
inverse agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a competitive agonist or a full
agonist is something that would just
[SPEAKER_00]: completely block the activity of either
THC or the endocannabinoids at this
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a molecule that does this called
remonibant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very useful in research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually approved as a drug given
to people in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They experienced severe side effects,
including dysphoria, depression,
[SPEAKER_00]: and suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, it was polled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal with remonibant as a therapeutic
agent was to limit the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually be an anti-obesity drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it limited a lot more than the
munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is very different from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't block the CB1 receptor,
if you can see in the bottom image there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interacting at an allosteric site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the anonimide, the 2AG, the THC could
still bind to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the signal that comes out of this
receptor is turned down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, CBD is basically turning down the
volume of the activity of these CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: agonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And likely CB2 as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though that's not super clear yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not exactly how CBD,
that's not the only way that CBD is
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of the benefits that we
attribute to CBD are not based on this
[SPEAKER_00]: negative allosteric modulation of CB1 and
CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're based on these other targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is likely the mechanism of CBD's
anti-nausea properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably some of its mood boosting
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as some of its ability to protect
the central nervous system after an
[SPEAKER_00]: insult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because interacting with that receptor can
improve vascular supply to damaged areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The TRIPV1 through TRIPV4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes the TRIPV1 capsaicin
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a great target for pain,
inflammation, and some psychiatric
[SPEAKER_00]: illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPARGAMMA has been mentioned several times
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the glycine receptor which has
implications for pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then CBD antagonizes a variety of
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to go through them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it inhibits the transport or reuptake
of various neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you notice the bottom one there,
anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is quite important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while CBD is turning down the volume at
CB1 and maybe CB2 as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also enhancing the activity of
anandamide by keeping it around in the
[SPEAKER_00]: synapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: By inhibiting its reuptake and also weakly
inhibiting FA which is the enzyme that
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks down anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually two different mechanisms of
increasing anandamide activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which would then enhance CB1 signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD is kind of working on CB1 in two
different directions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then CBD also has activity in the
mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have time to mention it this
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the mitochondria have cannabinoid
receptors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so much of medicine is now starting to
look at mitochondrial function.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a major player in neurologic illness
and chronic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the cannabinoid system has
some things to offer us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to tie this all up with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see these antispasmodic and anxiolytic
and antidepressant and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neuroprotective effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a basic summary slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, CBD works the best in
combination with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it really shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a stand alone agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: A single molecule pharmaceutical CBD
absolutely has some power.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really in the context of some of the
other aspects of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular THC, CBD works well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it antagonizes some of the side
effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: While enhancing some of the benefits of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically widens the therapeutic window
of THC when used together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it even decreases the appetite of
effects of THC for those worried about the
[SPEAKER_00]: munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we don't need remonabant to help us
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will mention that that hasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea that CBD kind of limits the high
of THC is likely the case to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't show up that clearly in all
the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of mixed results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to paint a picture that's
not black or white.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a study that showed that
administering fairly generous doses of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: in 90 minutes before smoking fairly weak
cannabis cigarettes containing THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: NITUS applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's like 5% THC by weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically didn't make people say that
they were not high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, based on this study,
if an oral dose of CBD administered prior
[SPEAKER_00]: to THC smoking will diminish the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see really no difference in the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it did diminish though was the
adverse aspect of the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, the anxiety and the paranoia and
the uncomfortable feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect that a lot of the euphoria and
the anxiolysis and the other desirable
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive properties of THC are able to
shine through even a very high dose of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: administered beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at the really severe
adverse effects of THC like an acute
[SPEAKER_00]: psychotic experience, CBD actually does
seem to limit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from McCallum and Russo from a
couple years ago, their paper on dosing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at kind of the threshold for toxic
psychosis of Marinol, which is just a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: THC drug, was about 18 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows a pretty small here,
so I can't quite see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I remember correctly, a combination
of approximately 1 to 1 CBD and THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: the threshold for toxic psychosis was
around 50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So half of the threshold for that would be
25.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically in the presence of an equal
quantity of CBD, the threshold for
[SPEAKER_00]: psychosis from THC went from 18 up to 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that's widening the
therapeutic index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone could tolerate more without
experiencing the severe side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two do go very well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have more to learn about
exactly how they interact and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this story is not just about CBD and
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is just a treasure trove of
phytoconstituents that have therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: activities, many cannabinoids,
terpenes, the acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also important to remember,
as Kevin mentioned earlier, that plants
[SPEAKER_00]: figured this out a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since they can't run away from predators,
how do they defend themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with these factories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trichomes are on the female
reproductive structures of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the structures that are going to be the
most vulnerable to damage from ultraviolet
[SPEAKER_00]: and other accidents, to pests,
to molds, invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these antimicrobial and antioxidant
properties that the plant is producing,
[SPEAKER_00]: these compounds to achieve in the plant,
they are also conveyed to people who take
[SPEAKER_00]: these as antimicrobials and antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving along, CBN, just some of the
pharmacology, it binds to CB2 a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better than CB1.
[SPEAKER_00]: In both cases, it's less potent than THC,
but very similar to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now CBN is not produced by the plant per
se, but it's an oxidative breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: product of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially in regions where there's a
lot of humidity and you would
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally dry the cannabis flowers out
in the sun, that ultraviolet light will
[SPEAKER_00]: convert some of the THC into CBN,
and that gives the flower a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: different quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mildly sedative, according to a report in
1976, I think a lot of people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis field assume that CBN is
sedating, and I think for some people it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, but what I've observed is a lot of
inter-individual variability, where CBN
[SPEAKER_00]: does seem to help some people sleep and it
seems to wake some people up, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably dozens of factors in there,
including the oxidation of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: components that nobody's looking at that
we're not really considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anti-inflammatory properties and also
antibiotic properties, including a potent
[SPEAKER_00]: agent against MRSA, antibiotic resistance,
not resistant to CBN and some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on to CBG, we have very low
activity at CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does activate the TRIP-V and the TRIP-A
receptors and the alpha-2 adrenergic,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the adrenal scepter, like clonidine
and guanfacine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clonidine used for treating blood
pressure, but also a very valuable some
[SPEAKER_00]: patholytic guanfacine, which has less of
the blood pressure effects, but used more
[SPEAKER_00]: for attention deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps CBG will emerge as something
that can help with that by suppressing
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive sympathetic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do any of your patients have excessive
sympathetic activity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do any of you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Inhibits a variety of receptors as well,
also anti-neoplastic, antimicrobial,
[SPEAKER_00]: and antidepressant effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there may be some evidence that CBC in
the presence of THC can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: potentiate the THC to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have had reports of varieties that
contain a little more CBC than typical,
[SPEAKER_00]: seem more psychoactive, but that's not due
to the CBC, that's due to enhanced THC
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have THCV, which is a CB1
antagonist at low doses, but a CB1 agonist
[SPEAKER_00]: at higher doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could this plant throw us any more curve
balls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully yes, but this is an interesting
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at these low doses, this could also be
an anti-munchy drug, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of this gentle antagonism,
producing weight loss, decreased body fat,
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased leptin concentrations,
increased energy expenditure, at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: mice, has anti-convulsant properties,
decreased edema and hyperalgesia in a
[SPEAKER_00]: mouse model, and also it lacks the adverse
effect liabilities of your typical inverse
[SPEAKER_00]: agonist like Ramanobant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not cause that dysphoria and that
dysregulation of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system as far as we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to some of the acidics,
THCA is non-psychoactive, but I will say
[SPEAKER_00]: that any time there is any THCA present,
there's always at least a tiny bit of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the earlier work on THCA was very
confounded because some researchers found
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's got some CB1 stimulating
activity, and some researchers found it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't, and it was kind of confusing,
but there's no such thing as a pure THCA
[SPEAKER_00]: standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the most pure will have a small
amount of THC in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was shown by McPartland a few years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not psychoactive, nevertheless,
a strong inhibitor of tumor necrosis
[SPEAKER_00]: factor alpha release, which is a major
inflammatory component of a chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, and anti-cancer effects,
also at least to some extent via the PPAR
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has some inhibitory activity at
TRIP M8, activating TRIP A1 and TRIP V4,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of these other cation channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my practice, I found it very useful for
treating arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit longer for people to
respond to it because it's not an
[SPEAKER_00]: analgesic per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an anti-inflammatory, but usually at
the two or four week mark, people are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to notice a difference,
and I usually am recommending it via T,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's not a lot of THCA products
available, and I think cannabis T is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really great delivery method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBDA is much more similar to CBD than
THCA is to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the pharmacology of THCA
and THC, they're very distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA has a lot of overlap with CBD,
and it seems to be more powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It activates the 5-HT1A serotonin
receptor, but much more strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not seem to act on the CB1 or CB2
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we described before, in many
situations, it's valuable to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: negative allosteric modulation of CB1 and
CB2 in order to make people tolerate their
[SPEAKER_00]: THC better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not always what we're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we want the full power of THC to
shine through, yet we also want some
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD-like effects in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that's where CBDA comes in,
because it can convey many of CBD's
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial qualities at a much lower dose
without the negative allosteric modulation
[SPEAKER_00]: of CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a strategy to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA is also the only cannabinoid that's a
strong COX-2 inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we don't know if CBDA would share
some of the liabilities and side effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of some of the other COX-2 inhibition
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When used at high doses, I would be
cautious with some of the other problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: like gastrointestinal and cardiovascular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the beautiful thing about it is we
don't need to use it in high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a little data from 2013 in a
rodent model of nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're counting something called GAPES,
because these rodents don't vomit,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just gag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can count them.
[SPEAKER_00]: After administering a high dose of lithium
chloride, which would make most of us gag,
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what the anti-emetic activity is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I point out the increased efficacy
of THC-A compared to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dosing here on the bottom,
you can see it's milligrams per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 0.05 milligrams per kilogram of THC-A,
a tiny, tiny dose even for humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially tiny for rodents, suppress
their nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 times that dose of THC-A didn't make it
any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really was 10 times that dose of
THC that was required to even show some
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no effect of THC at 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 0.5, 0.5 of THC where you began to
see the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10x the potency at least on THC-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did these researchers know to look in
these very low dosing ranges of THC-A?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell just a quick story about THC-A,
because I've been looking at the very low
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing range of it for a while,
for about five years now, with great
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in 2013, as many of you are aware,
Sanjay Gupta came out with his first
[SPEAKER_00]: documentary, Weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were looking for CBD to treat
their seizures, and their kids especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, we had just started a
cannabis analytic laboratory in my
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very excited when a patient came
in and said, I got this bottle of CBD from
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensary, and it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter's seizures are way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had heard that story a couple of
times before, but this was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: chance I had to really find out what the
dosage was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because back then, there was no labeling,
no testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the first analytic lab in our
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I grabbed the bottle, and we took a
little sample of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran it through the HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was expecting to find out how much
CBD this kid was getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer was 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no CBD in that bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was pretty much no THC in that
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very weak glycerite of THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the only peak that was
significant in there, THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kid was getting such a low dose,
I had a very hard time believing that that
[SPEAKER_00]: was working for seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not sure about the placebo effect
in cases like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, parental report can be
influenced by things that the parent hopes
[SPEAKER_00]: is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't really know what to make
out of it, except that the dispensary was
[SPEAKER_00]: selling something that wasn't what they
said it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some kind of a cannabis oil that
didn't get people high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was actually just a raw cannabis
infusion into glycerin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, that happened a few more times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked to a few people around the
world that were seeing the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: before I believed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA has an efficacy range way,
way down, lower than most people would
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In certain situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the authors who did that last study
looked at CBD-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: But notice the scale is different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micrograms per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went even lower on CBD-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that a half of a microgram
per kilogram, again, that is so small in
[SPEAKER_00]: rodents, it's hard to even describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the equivalent in a human would be
brushing up against a cannabis flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: letting some of that resin get on your arm
and absorb through the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is tiny, tiny difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tiny dosing reduced nausea in a
similar rodent nausea model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we just have the chart looking at
COX-1 and COX-2 in comparison with
[SPEAKER_00]: endomethacin and diclofenac.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the big signal on CBD-A at
the bottom of the graph there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there has been some anticonvulsant
activity reported around THCA way back in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1970, what was this?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1974, I think, 1979.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at very high doses in rodents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as you'll learn from the rest
of today, the cannabinoids are very
[SPEAKER_00]: dichotomous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work in very high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work in very low doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's bidirectional effects and biphasic
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna cover all of that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, again, doesn't surprise me that we
see some activity against seizures at very
[SPEAKER_00]: high doses and at extraordinarily low
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about some of the
pharmacokinetic properties of TB.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and how our bodies deal with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know surprisingly little about the
pharmacokinetics and the metabolism of
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's likely analogous to THC,
where we have the absorption, the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration into the body fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have metabolism in the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you some of the metabolites
in a future slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have excretion, both through
the feces and through the urine,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as through the skin and the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bioavailability of THC, as you can see,
it ranges quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an older study that summarized
some of the data that was available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oral bioavailability is pretty low,
regardless of what study you look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inhalation gets a bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were a couple studies of
rectal bioavailability, which showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemisuccinate preparation was much
more bioavailable than a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: suppository.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, worked a little bit better
than oral.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's take a look at some of these
curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left, and thank you for getting
this up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in the future, there is a way to
switch this up so that it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger, because the slides appear quite
small on this monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to deal with it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking on the left, I believe we have
the oral.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some help here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, say it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the inhaled cannabis, you can see
the dotted line is the peak of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that peaks very, very high early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 15 minutes, we get this peak effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it drops rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see a lot of 11-hydroxy THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the larger number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the larger dashed line towards the
bottom, because there's not that first
[SPEAKER_00]: pass metabolism with inhaled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time, what we see is the carboxy
THC, which is an inactive metabolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll review those metabolites on the
following slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as we go over to the right,
we have a different scale on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want you to note that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what happens when people take THC by
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blood level of THC stays way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see it way down there at the
bottom?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a slightly higher level of
11-hydroxy THC, which is an active
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this large quantity of
the inactive metabolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have low oral bioavailability and a
lot of first pass metabolism that really
[SPEAKER_00]: ends up making very low levels of these
active constituents in the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'll say is that the blood levels
of these compounds don't correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: directly with the clinical effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a really good example of that is when
people inhale THC, their peak blood level
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC occurs at a different time than the
peak psychoactive experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're peaking psychoactively,
their blood level has already dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could give someone that tiny
little bump of THC you see in the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the middle chart there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might feel stronger than what
you're seeing over to the left as far as a
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really doesn't correlate directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's analgesic and anti-aimetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the other effects don't correlate
directly with blood levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the right, I believe we are
comparing intravenous, smoked,
[SPEAKER_00]: and oral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the intravenous and
smoked look quite similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that intravenous is a good route for
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very likely to cause psychotic
transient experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the metabolism of THC is mainly in the
liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's extra hepatic metabolism as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, just as I've mentioned a
few times here, there's an 11-hydroxy form
[SPEAKER_00]: that is an active metabolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people assume that it's more
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly may be that way for some.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's just qualitatively
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that take cannabis more via an oral
mucosal route versus swallowing it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to kind of describe some of the
difference between having more first pass
[SPEAKER_00]: and less first pass metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually, there's a qualitative
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say the first pass,
by swallowing it, they get more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle relaxant effect or maybe more of a
body effect, less of a cerebral effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people say the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here we have CBD pharmacokinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very high doses, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, most of our patients can't
afford 6,000 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess it's worth trying that in a
single dose just to see how safe it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But twice daily dosing, it's still very
high levels for six days and evaluating
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect of having it after a meal or on
an empty stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was delivered via the new drug
Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so first of all, the adverse effects,
diarrhea, nausea, headache, and
[SPEAKER_00]: somnolence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to the maximum plasma concentration
was four to five hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reached a steady state after
approximately two days with very moderate
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so probably someone that's on a steady
dose of CBD for even, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could say maybe three days,
then we've reached a steady blood level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important when we talk
later about how frequently to titrate a
[SPEAKER_00]: dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't want to titrate it one day
after the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to give that much time for someone
to achieve a steady level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half life, 10 to 17 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: No change in their labs, even with those
super high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical exam, vital signs, ECG or body
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: No consistent effect on sleep or
sleepiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows up a lot in literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, CBD seems to help some
people sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to keep some people awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to predict who's going to be who.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no clear evidence of any drug
withdrawal syndrome during the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the conclusions are takeaway
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twice daily administration seems to make
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taken with a high fat meal, you can get
four to five fold the oral absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably a good idea to
recommend people to take it after
[SPEAKER_00]: breakfast and after lunch is usually what
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because sometimes I'm cautious
about after dinner in case it keeps them
[SPEAKER_00]: awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: All adverse effects were mild and
moderate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And safety data is consistent with what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's currently established.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll skip that little part on the side
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some pharmacokinetics published
for the first time in the last year about
[SPEAKER_00]: the acidic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can imagine, I got very excited to
see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It confirmed what I was suspecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the acidic cannabinoids, having the
carboxylic acid group on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are more hydrophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little more water soluble and
maybe get better distributed in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at what happened
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we can see a comparison of THC and
CBD when taken in two forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a decoction, which is like a tea,
except it's simmered for a prolonged
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time while covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other is an oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that these were so-called
galenic preparations out of Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the studies out of Italy are
looking at the right things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like the rigor of their
starting materials and procedures can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm so glad they're looking at THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that there was some
variability, especially in the decoction,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit of variability in actually
what people were taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, some interesting results
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more CBD absorbed than THC in the
decoction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here when we started looking
at the acidics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that orange peak, that's THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for the THC peak as far
as what was absorbed, you can see it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just way, way down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I could do a better job
explaining if I could actually see it from
[SPEAKER_00]: up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think you'll notice is that a
lot greater absorption of THCA compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: THC in both the oil and the decoction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the top of the slide,
you'll see that there were roughly equal
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting much better absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's kind of flipped on
its head that the study showed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a little hard to see,
remember the oral dosing of
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical-grade THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw higher levels of 11-hydroxy than we
saw of the parent compound THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's reversed in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have higher levels of THC than
the 11-hydroxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's likely because the presence of
these other cannabinoids, the acidic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, is inhibiting some of that
first-pass metabolism of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that happens a lot in
complex botanical medicines is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of compounds which share similar
structures, when they get to the liver,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have pharmacokinetic effects on the
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can really change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even before it gets to the liver,
it can change the absorption, and it can
[SPEAKER_00]: change the metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it looks like having some of these
acidic cannabinoids can decrease that
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion to 11-hydroxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking over here at CBDA, again,
we see some really pronounced absorption
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBDA compared to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was just some of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take a look at the area under
the curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did the math for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's looking like THCA versus THC,
and the decoction was absorbed 50 times
[SPEAKER_00]: better and 30 times better out of an oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more modest for CBD, but still a much
higher absorption for CBDA compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to wrap up here with a few
more slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a very important but
controversial topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want you to just be aware of the
science that we have behind it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good review in the 2017 National
Academies of Sciences Engineering and
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine report, which looked at all the
data on infants and children that had been
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to cannabinoids perinatally and
prenatally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was that the only
consistent finding was smaller for
[SPEAKER_00]: gestational age.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't dangerously small.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an ultra-low preterm and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was smaller for gestational age,
which was consistent with any exposure to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, when someone's smoking,
they're getting carbon monoxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting other chemical compounds
that could interfere with blood supply and
[SPEAKER_00]: other factors in the fetus and cause a
slightly smaller baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it with tobacco as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these authors attributed the small
for gestational age to the smoke itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very high level summary from
the 2017 report.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were actually just three new studies
that came out in the last couple months
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at cannabis and pregnancy and
lactation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their basic conclusion was that all
the rest of our data is really unreliable
[SPEAKER_00]: because so much of it is based on
self-report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one study came out that looked at the
difference between self-report and urine
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicology screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can imagine, there's a lot of
differences there for many good reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: why moms aren't self-reporting in cannabis
and why some are, I'm not sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the current political environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids and lactation, they are
present in breast milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: One early study from 2013 estimated that
the neonate would be exposed to less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% of the mother's exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's per kilogram of body weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is getting into the breast milk,
but the exposure to the infant is very
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: A subsequent study found a little bit of a
higher result there.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.5% of the maternal dose being delivered
to the infant per kilogram of body weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless mom's taken a lot, it's still
very little exposure to the infant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not saying that so that you assume
very little is irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very small doses of cannabinoids can
absolutely be relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we can say right now if this
is a good thing or a bad thing because it
[SPEAKER_00]: probably depends on the situation,
which is a complex family and community
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that involves factors like
maternal stress and maternal sleep and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of mom's other health issues and some
of the baby's issues and the baby's
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that may relate to the mom's
health issues and all sorts of factors
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know is that lots of kids have
been exposed to cannabis during pregnancy
[SPEAKER_00]: and lactation, and they don't develop
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's a little acceleration or
a little deceleration of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: milestones prior to age five, but by the
time they reach age five, it's a wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this doesn't seem like it's
inherently dangerous for children to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the cannabinoid pharmacology
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
