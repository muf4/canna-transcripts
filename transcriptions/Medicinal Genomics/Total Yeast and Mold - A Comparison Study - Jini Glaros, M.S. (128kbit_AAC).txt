[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody, welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today we're gonna talk about total
yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are in the lab industry,
you're probably very familiar with total
[SPEAKER_03]: yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not, some of this may be very
new to you, so I am gonna do a brief
[SPEAKER_03]: overview at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is total yeast and mold?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we talk about total yeast and mold
testing, we're talking about looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: quantitatively the number of
colony-forming units that are present in
[SPEAKER_03]: one gram of sample, or CFU per gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we quantify it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we report out a result, we say
there's 3,000 CFU per gram, or 10,000 CFU
[SPEAKER_03]: per gram, or whatever that number may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And total yeast and mold can include so
many different species.
[SPEAKER_03]: It includes everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every total mold or yeast you can think
of, it includes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So aspergillus, penicillin, candida,
sportabolus, pichia, fusarium,
[SPEAKER_03]: and many more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the complexities with
doing total yeast and mold testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're looking for so many different
things, how do you know if you're seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: them all?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you know if everything you're
seeing is dangerous, or if everything
[SPEAKER_03]: you're seeing is good?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the problem that arises with total
yeast and mold testing?
[SPEAKER_03]: So total yeast and mold testing in a
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's three primary ways that
laboratories are providing total yeast and
[SPEAKER_03]: mold testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first being culture-based plating
methods, and that's gonna be using an
[SPEAKER_03]: agar, or a petri film, or a membrane
filter, and growing colonies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna take a sample, dilute it
with a media, add the sample to the plate,
[SPEAKER_03]: put that in the incubator, and then wait
for it to grow, and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're gonna count those
colonies.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next way is gonna be qPCR methods,
or quantitative polymerase chain reaction
[SPEAKER_03]: methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that's gonna do is you're gonna
take the sample, and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: completely isolate the DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna isolate both the cannabis DNA
and the microbe DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, you're gonna use primers and
other, mix that with that, the primers
[SPEAKER_03]: that'll look for both the cannabis DNA and
the microbe DNA, and then you're gonna put
[SPEAKER_03]: that on the PCR, and it's gonna heat and
cool and heat and cool, and it's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: replicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if those microbes are present,
you'll see this fluorescence, and you'll
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to detect and quantitate the
amount of yeast and mold present.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally is gonna be most probable
number methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are culture-based methods but
the principle behind them is slightly
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not physically growing colonies.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this, you're actually looking at
specific characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether that be turbidity changes or
acid production, and you're using that to
[SPEAKER_03]: predict the amount of cells that would
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not actually culturing it,
but it is, in a sense, a culture-based
[SPEAKER_03]: method.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with this, you run all of these
different experiments, and you get tons of
[SPEAKER_03]: different results, which is the reason for
this comparison study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, first off, what we wanted to do
was we wanted to analyze cannabis samples
[SPEAKER_03]: using different types of plates,
whether that be agar, petri film,
[SPEAKER_03]: and membrane filters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plating is a really big controversy,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to lab A, and you get a plating
result of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to lab B, and you get a plating
result drastically different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is going on there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we wanted to be able to compare
these methods and assess the
[SPEAKER_03]: reproducibility of the methods both
individually and then also against one
[SPEAKER_03]: another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through this, we were gonna also be
able to determine how the non-homogenous
[SPEAKER_03]: nature of cannabis impacts total yeast and
mold testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know cannabis is not homogenous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens if I take a one-gram scoop
here and a one-gram scoop here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I get completely different results?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which result is right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I get way more yeast and mold in this
scoop and less yeast and mold in this
[SPEAKER_03]: scoop?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that raises questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, to establish true
incubation times for each plating method.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the different manufacturers that
produce these plates make recommendations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Incubate for 48 to 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a cannabis lab and you've been
told by a manufacturer you could incubate
[SPEAKER_03]: for a minimum of 48 hours, chances are
cannabis labs are just gonna proceed with
[SPEAKER_03]: that because turnaround time is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to get those results out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though that method may need to go
longer and so we wanted to establish that
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sample prep and design.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we did here was we took three unique
samples and these three unique samples
[SPEAKER_03]: were weighed up five times and then we
plated those samples at three different
[SPEAKER_03]: dilutions and we used seven different
types of plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So four agars, two Petri films and a
membrane filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also took a single aliquot
that you see here and we weighed it five
[SPEAKER_03]: times or we had it weighed once and then
we prepped it five times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the goal of that was to show the
reproducibility from in one aliquot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have one aliquot theoretically,
it should have the same amount of yeast
[SPEAKER_03]: and mold throughout.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should get the same result for every
single one of those samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So true incubation times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about that first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I mentioned, manufacturers will make
a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_03]: 48 to 72 hours, 72 to 96 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's all they give you and so it's
the laboratory's responsibility to
[SPEAKER_03]: validate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, laboratories aren't always the
best at that or don't really know how to
[SPEAKER_03]: go about doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what we did here and these
are the true incubation times we
[SPEAKER_03]: established for total yeast and mold for
each of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the true incubation time was
established as the point in time when no
[SPEAKER_03]: new colonies formed and instead the
colonies only started to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just got bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll see on the next slide this
drastic difference between that 48 and 72
[SPEAKER_03]: hour and that's where we're gonna focus is
that Petri film rapid yeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And mold this true incubation time is 72
hours even though the manufacturer
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations is anywhere from 48 to 72.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you can see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see here this top set of plates
is gonna be the rapid yeast and mold after
[SPEAKER_03]: 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with these samples, we put them in
after 24 hours, we pulled them out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: incubator, took pictures, put them back in
for another 24, pulled them out,
[SPEAKER_03]: took pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did that all the way up to 120 hours
and you can see there is a drastic
[SPEAKER_03]: difference between the 48 hour and the 72
hour plate results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on this and then reading those
plates and attempting to count those
[SPEAKER_03]: plates, I mean counting the 48 hour plates
is not easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even when you do count them,
you're drastically under quantifying what
[SPEAKER_03]: that true amount is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at an average CFU per gram
at 48 hours of only 44,000 whereas by 72
[SPEAKER_03]: hours we had 165,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did want to note here that past the
72 hours, that average stayed about the
[SPEAKER_03]: same.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really didn't see an increase which is
why we established that as that true
[SPEAKER_03]: incubation time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next is gonna be the lack of
reproducibility we saw between plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here is gonna be a DRBC and a Sabdex
plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the same exact sample prepped
so it's out of the same tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: We prepped it and plated it on the two
different plates and you can see for the
[SPEAKER_03]: DRBC we got an average of like 127,000
versus an average of 86,000 with Sabdex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if you're in the world of micro,
you may say, wait, that's not that
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are kind of duplicate numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the world of Florida where our
regulations are 100,000 CFU per gram,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is the difference between a product
passing and a product failing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if a laboratory was using Sabdex,
they would pass this sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if a laboratory is using DRBC,
they would fail the sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally is gonna be suppressions at
low dilution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the Sabdex plates again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I want to point out here is that
200x dilution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see that 200x dilution,
that average is only about 25,000 across
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's much lower than the average
we're seeing for that 1,000x and that
[SPEAKER_03]: 10,000x.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately I think it's due to over
saturation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many microbes present that no
more can grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if you're using this 200x,
it is going to drive your overall average
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's gonna take the average.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see if you ignore it, your average
goes from 61 to 81,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes from 165,000 to 235,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from 86,000 to 115,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the dilutions you use are crucial if
you are plating.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to be making sure you're using
dilutions that make sense for your sample
[SPEAKER_03]: and for your sample type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we had the lack of homogeneity and
reproducibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that sample that I told you,
we took the one aliquot and we prepped it
[SPEAKER_03]: five times out of the same exact tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the results we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 110,000, 50,000, 210,000, 90,000,
and 80,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all over the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is again the difference between,
for states who have a 10,000 CFU per gram
[SPEAKER_03]: limit, this is all failing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for states like Florida, where we have
100,000 CFU gram per limit, what do we do
[SPEAKER_03]: here?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the correct answer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this product failing or is this product
passing?
[SPEAKER_03]: So conclusions for this portion of the
experiment are that the lack of
[SPEAKER_03]: homogeneity seen in cannabis flower can
make it difficult to determine
[SPEAKER_03]: quantitative total yeast and mold results.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may take a scoop here and get one
result.
[SPEAKER_03]: The scoop there and get one result.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may not be due to the method itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be due to the sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do we create a more homogenous
sample in that sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also the use of different agars or media
can lead to variations in the number of
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms that can successfully grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So certain plates have certain antibiotics
which allow certain organisms to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other organisms can't grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so depending on what a lab is using,
they may be able to skew those results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them may not even be realizing
they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They may just be using what they've been
told is the gold standard to use for
[SPEAKER_03]: plating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now they could be under
quantifying those results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also the dilutions used during the plating
process can impact those final
[SPEAKER_03]: calculations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to make sure you're working in
the proper range.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're doing a 100X and your sample has
100,000 CFU per gram, you're not gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to grow all of those colonies on a
plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're gonna skew those results low
once you take that average.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the incubation time for each
plate type must be determined prior to
[SPEAKER_03]: processing samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: All laboratories really need to go about
this process.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to take whatever plate type
they're using and you need to let it grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Establish that true incubation time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truly validate when those samples are
ready to come out of the incubator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also the use of internal controls
is something that I think we should
[SPEAKER_03]: consider.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to go about doing this,
but I figured what better of a conference
[SPEAKER_03]: to kind of say this would be a great thing
to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about QPCR.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use an internal control to make sure
our extraction worked, to make sure we did
[SPEAKER_03]: it properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chemistry side, we use internal
standards to make sure things worked
[SPEAKER_03]: properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there a way to implement something
like that into the plating process?
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, we're gonna switch to talking
about remediation of failing flour
[SPEAKER_03]: products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the cannabis, if it fails for
total yeast and mold there or aspergillus,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a common technique that is to
remediate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether you're remediating that
through lots of different options,
[SPEAKER_03]: but two of the main options are gonna be
ozone, which is gonna be known as,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a willow is what the most common
brand is called.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the rad source, which is gonna use
x-rays to remediate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's gonna radiate the product
basically, use the x-rays, kill the yeast
[SPEAKER_03]: and mold theoretically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that will result in the product
being safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see people doing this and as a
laboratory who runs QPCR primarily,
[SPEAKER_03]: people remediate their products and it
still fails.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, I killed all of the yeast and
mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, I still see the yeast
and mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, well, switch to plating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we said, we'll look into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is where this study came about.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this, we wanted to analyze cannabis
samples pre and post radiation using QPCR,
[SPEAKER_03]: both QPCR regular and QPCR with Grim
Reifer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Grim Reifer will remove that dead DNA
and get rid of whatever they may have
[SPEAKER_03]: killed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then agar plates and petri film.
[SPEAKER_03]: We then wanted to add an enrichment step
to that plating process of the radiated
[SPEAKER_03]: product to measure cell viability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the thoughts here is sublethal
cell injury.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cells aren't actually being killed,
they're just being injured.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we give them an environment that
makes them happy, maybe they'll grow for
[SPEAKER_03]: you and then you can actually properly
quantitate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to add this enrichment step
to kind of see what happened there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also we wanted to look at the pre
and post samples for cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes to see what that was also doing
to the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for this experimental design,
what we did was we took all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: lovely different samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had pre rad, post rad, two weeks
post rad, four weeks post rad,
[SPEAKER_03]: six weeks post rad, and eight weeks post
rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to mention that the pre and
post rad are the same exact sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: The client literally took a sample,
grabbed a handful of it out before
[SPEAKER_03]: radiating it, put it in the radiate,
then grabbed more of it and gave it to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the two weeks, four weeks,
six weeks, and eight weeks are different
[SPEAKER_03]: samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just those time points out post
radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for doing that is to see if
after eight weeks have those cells
[SPEAKER_03]: repaired themselves and are now we're
gonna have tons of yeast and mold growth
[SPEAKER_03]: whenever we go to plate this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we took all of those samples,
we prepped them in triplicate,
[SPEAKER_03]: then we plated them at three dilutions
using DRBC and 3M rapid yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also analyzed those samples
via QPCR and QPCR with GrimRever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the average CFUs that we saw
across the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything in red is gonna be those
failing CFUs in the state of Florida,
[SPEAKER_03]: so 100,000 over 100,000 CFU per gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that that pre rad sample
across the board, it failed even with the
[SPEAKER_03]: use of GrimRever brought the number down
some, but it still failed plating 300,000,
[SPEAKER_03]: 250,000, 330,000, and 142,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very evident that flour was
extremely contaminated, not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely don't want that flour on the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The post rad, however, you can see when we
ran QPCR on it, we got 435,000,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then when we plated it, we only saw
1,600 and 1,400.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is without that enrichment step.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no enrichment step, these are the
numbers that we were seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So drastically lower numbers across the
board.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the theory of the reason why you get
higher results with QPCR is because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: not destroying the DNA, but it's dead,
seemed to make sense, but we still weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: convinced.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not 100% convinced that this product
is safe for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's when we added this
enrichment step.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we did here was, and you can
see these little circles that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: circled, these are little dots that are
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what they are, we don't know
if they're trichome interactions,
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't know if they're just particulate,
or are they colonies that are attempting
[SPEAKER_03]: to form, but something has happened during
this radiation process, and now these
[SPEAKER_03]: colonies can't grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is, so I wanna figure
out what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we took those samples, put them in the
incubator for three hours, and then we
[SPEAKER_03]: plated them again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that allowed us to enrich them,
give them that time to get excited and get
[SPEAKER_03]: happy, and if they were alive,
hopefully to grow for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here is the CFU averages after
enrichment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with no enrichment for that pre-rad
sample, you saw about 300,000 or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: After enrichment, you saw way,
way higher numbers, which tells me that my
[SPEAKER_03]: enrichment process worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I wanted to enrich that pre-rad
sample, is to show that if you enrich it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's there, if it's happy, if it's in
good juice, it's gonna work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were able to show that with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then post-rad, you can see,
we did see a slight increase in some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these samples, but nothing drastic,
nothing that would lead us to believe that
[SPEAKER_03]: the product was failing.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as if we're going to plate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, that doesn't mean that these
cells are not viable, but not culturable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are they still viable?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they still dangerous?
[SPEAKER_03]: But can we just not culture them?
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at cannabinoids and terpenes,
then, is gonna be our pre-rad and our
[SPEAKER_03]: post-rad flower here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to the naked eye, these flower samples
may look the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, these pictures may not be the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if you look at these in person,
and you are looking at cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're looking at cannabis flower all
day, every day, like our team is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get samples in that are radiated,
and we can normally tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, this went through rad source,
or this went through willow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they look almost bleached.
[SPEAKER_03]: They aren't as vibrant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They aren't as green.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that doing to the flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for a consumer, they may never notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They may never see the difference in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they may never be told that their
product went through rad source,
[SPEAKER_03]: or went through ozone treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we ran the potency and the terpenes,
and you can see that the pre-rad sample,
[SPEAKER_03]: the average potency was 18.3, and then
post-rad was 15.4, and then for the total
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes, we saw 2.37, and then that
dropped to 1.98.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, when you calculate the RPDs
between those results, they're about 17%
[SPEAKER_03]: for both.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we saw a 17% RPD decrease after
radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this mean this happens to every
single sample that goes through the rad
[SPEAKER_03]: source?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, but this is what we saw from
our preliminary analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we saw from our preliminary
investigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So conclusions with this is gonna be that
QPCR and Grim Reaper QPCR yield higher
[SPEAKER_03]: amounts of total yeast and mold in
radiated cannabis products than plating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're definitely getting a higher
concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: What concentration is right, I'm still not
convinced by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Total yeast and mold is a pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're here to figure it out,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The addition of enrichment step can lead
to overgrowth in the pre-radiated samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you definitely don't want to enrich
your pre-radiated samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the post-radiated flour did not
yield a drastic increase, but it just
[SPEAKER_03]: makes me feel more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is something alive there,
if I give it a chance, maybe it'll grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes me, as a laboratory,
feel a little bit more confident in
[SPEAKER_03]: releasing plating results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then any viable cells that may be
present in radiated flour do not come
[SPEAKER_03]: cultureable for at least eight weeks after
treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we saw there is we treated
that, they were treated eight weeks later,
[SPEAKER_03]: we still saw no growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean they're not viable?
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I don't have the answer to that,
but I can say that I was not able to
[SPEAKER_03]: culture them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabinoid and terpene content can
decrease after a product is undergone
[SPEAKER_03]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether or not this is an outlier,
this is something that happens every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This could also change based on the amount
of time it's in the rad source.
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of rad source that it
experiences, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of variables here that,
in further studies, we're gonna need to
[SPEAKER_03]: better control.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna need to have more information
from our client of exactly how long
[SPEAKER_03]: they're being exposed to the X-ray,
what rate of X-ray they're being exposed
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can kind of better pinpoint,
is there a point where you're destroying
[SPEAKER_03]: the yeast and mold, but you're not hurting
the flour?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then more research is needed to
determine whether or not this remediation
[SPEAKER_03]: process is truly removing all of the total
yeast and mold, or if it's simply fooling
[SPEAKER_03]: the test.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the big takeaway here,
is remediation able to actually fix our
[SPEAKER_03]: product, or is remediation just figuring
out a way to trick the test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your presentation, very
informative indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, one of the health
concerns of this microbial contamination
[SPEAKER_00]: is related to the mycotoxins produced by
some of those species, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: fusarium aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that remediation might kill
those microorganisms, but what happens to
[SPEAKER_00]: those mycotoxins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they also eliminated?
[SPEAKER_03]: So mycotoxins are interesting because
they're not a living species anymore,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the microbes, so they're secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the mycotoxins, when you have a
microbial and it starts to break down,
[SPEAKER_03]: you form this secondary metabolite.
[SPEAKER_03]: From our experience, we have seen that
even when you extract something,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it previously had that contaminant,
and it allowed it to form, we've still
[SPEAKER_03]: seen mycotoxins present.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say that it doesn't get rid of
it, so you're still having a whole nother
[SPEAKER_03]: battle, which is why that mycotoxin
testing is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're able to eliminate the
microorganism, mycotoxin still is
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining in the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that they're self-picking these
samples, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The companies are self-picking the sample,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no state of...
[SPEAKER_03]: For final product, we do all of the
sampling ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once the product has been radiated,
if it's being sent for final compliance
[SPEAKER_03]: testing, it is already in its package,
and we go out and randomly select.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for this experiment, they sent the
sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, Florida is very strict about
their sampling procedures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a minimum or maximum to the lot
size that you get to pick from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it mandated on the volume?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 10 pounds that you actually pick
that sample from, or is it 20?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's based on the batch size.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to take 0.35% of the batch plus
10 grams for total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're gonna take a minimum or a
minimum of 15 grams plus 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're always, as a lab, bringing back a
minimum of 25 grams of flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 grams of flour from a maximum volume
of... That would be from a maximum of
[SPEAKER_03]: about 4,000 grams, and then after that,
it would increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's... So as your batch size
increases, once you reach that threshold
[SPEAKER_03]: of the 0.35%, you then have to start
collecting more sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's better than a lot of states.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, there's some samples where we
literally bring back like 250 grams of
[SPEAKER_03]: sample.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, great talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a... Well, I'm curious about
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I buy my weed, I don't bring it home
and soak it in a broth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I do I need to care about these
residual microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would care more about the
mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the microbes, the thing is that's
just allowing us to culture them and to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But standardly, they're still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just allowing us to quantify them
by adding them to that broth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're that hard to culture,
then they're probably... I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems like they're probably less
competent to infect me too, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you have some powdery mildew,
I don't think you wanna be inhaling the
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I don't want the toxins or the
residue from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you measure these irradiated
samples, I would love to see the error
[SPEAKER_01]: bars and stuff because we do this with so
much of our food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irradiation is brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen lots of data from RadSource and
other radiation companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people suck at using the
machines, but... I think RadSource and
[SPEAKER_03]: radiation is used differently in other
industries though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's used for shelf life purposes rather
than to kill bad things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, just the fact that the critters
were growing in the weed, that's the bad
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been crapping in my weed,
so that's why I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would find it hard to believe that used
properly, this RadSource is gonna do a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't do much chemistry with
x-rays.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we use it for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's why more research
ultimately needs to be done before we just
[SPEAKER_03]: put a ton of RadSource product on the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it doing to the product?
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure it's actually solving the
problem rather than just tricking the test
[SPEAKER_03]: because there are dangerous molds that
could be present.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aspergillus could be present and RadSource
could allow that colony not to grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the Aspergillus then broke down into
mycotoxins that now you're inhaling
[SPEAKER_03]: mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's so many different pieces to the
puzzle that I think that the whole picture
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
