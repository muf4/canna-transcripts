[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a child neurologist, it makes sense
that we don't really come into this
[SPEAKER_01]: profession with much information or
knowledge on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not part of our normal curriculum,
certainly not taught in medical school,
[SPEAKER_01]: nor through residency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do we learn this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a pediatric neurologist, everything we
learn that's decent usually comes from the
[SPEAKER_01]: moms that we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any of the good ideas that I've really
come across have typically come from moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some dads who've had ideas also,
and I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dad, so I can get away with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first experience here really came
from a mom who was absolutely brilliant,
[SPEAKER_01]: who came to me with her son with autism,
who was experiencing significant
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges with aggression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that time, he was coming to me with
reports from school.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was roughly eight years old at that
time, but he was coming to me with reports
[SPEAKER_01]: from school saying that they weren't
making no progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was having somewhere between 50 to 300
aggressive episodes per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those would include things like biting,
kicking, trying to run out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: classroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The teachers had to wear Taekwondo pads
just to protect themselves from the
[SPEAKER_01]: biting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his plan, his individualized education
plan was not able to be followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something that he simply could not
meet any of the goals that were being set
[SPEAKER_01]: for him because the aggression
overshadowed everything else that was
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about the standard
approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that time, it was a relatively
recent article from the New England
[SPEAKER_01]: Journal showing benefit for Respiradone
for aggressive behaviors and autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mom knew the article inside out.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had read it, and she'd reviewed it,
and she had her own criticisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: which were quite good, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of them was that it only enrolled
49 children in the treatment arm,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it only followed them over eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there really hadn't been, and there
still aren't, very good long-term data for
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This issue of aggression and autism is
something that is a major epidemic now.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think of when the autism epidemic
hit, it was something that really picked
[SPEAKER_01]: up 15 to 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're seeing 15 to 20-year-olds,
and through adolescence, we're seeing that
[SPEAKER_01]: the issues in autism do change over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the young children that we're seeing,
many times through adolescence,
[SPEAKER_01]: start to develop increased aggressive
behaviors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more commonly seen in boys,
but we do see it in girls as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the boys who I've seen with
this had a history of regression,
[SPEAKER_01]: autistic regression, when they were about
two years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them have a history of epilepsy as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at what this does to
families, to the individuals, to the
[SPEAKER_01]: schools, it's a major challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a minor thing at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens with a lot of the
kids, because I've seen many of these kids
[SPEAKER_01]: who've come from a background where they
were put on antipsychotics, is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: common side effect that you may know is
weight gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can think of another patient that
came to me who was, at that time,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had gone up, through the use of
antipsychotics, he had gone from about 150
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds to close to 300 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now he was not only aggressive,
but he could have actually played in the
[SPEAKER_01]: NFL, speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could have been an offensive tackle
himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only was he aggressive, he was a 300
pound aggressive kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was about six foot four, 300 pounds,
non-verbal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's like my lovable grizzly bear,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a little like a grizzly bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll give you a hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the sweetest kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got the greatest heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the aggressions, of course,
when you're 300 pounds, and most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: workers in many of the schools that treat
and deal with children with autism,
[SPEAKER_01]: many times you see mostly women at those
schools, and not many of whom are six foot
[SPEAKER_01]: four, 300 pounds to match this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's frightening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that patient's mother happened to weigh
about 100 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he became aggressive,
he would hit her violently in the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have other moms who are covering their
scars with makeup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have moms who come to me who are afraid
to bring their kids to the emergency room
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're afraid that their husbands
are going to be suspected for abusing
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's their sons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an epidemic now of women who
are abused by their sons with autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isolates a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings massive anxiety to the family,
massive dysfunction, can often result in
[SPEAKER_01]: divorce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, whenever that occurs,
it's the mother who's left alone to care
[SPEAKER_01]: for these challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you think of as children
transition towards adulthood, what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: placements for a 22-year-old violent or
aggressive, nonverbal, obese boy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there really are none that exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a major challenge now facing us
with what happens in the adult world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really a pediatric epileptologist
by training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see and treat epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my specialty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in doing so, I've sort of accumulated
a large population of kids with autism and
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressive behaviors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had found that my own experience in
the use of antipsychotics,
[SPEAKER_01]: antidepressants, was really limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still faced major challenges in terms
of improving those core symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most important thing to note is
that the use of antipsychotics,
[SPEAKER_01]: although they had been shown in those
trials to reduce the aggressive behaviors,
[SPEAKER_01]: they really did nothing for the core
symptoms of autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't improve social relatedness or
communication, which are huge parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, too, is the increased
appetite in many kids drives, because the
[SPEAKER_01]: child's hunger is driven, you actually
sometimes paradoxically increase
[SPEAKER_01]: aggression, because there are a lot of
aggressive episodes driven towards
[SPEAKER_01]: food-seeking behaviors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the refrigerator has to be chained
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first mom, we worked together on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was sort of a journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She came to me in about 2005, when this
whole field of cannabis was very unknown
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She presented many good ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started first with Marinol as a
treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually worked for a short time,
but started to lose efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we discussed whether she could
find a grower, which she did.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, I was seeing her in Rhode
Island at the time, which Rhode Island had
[SPEAKER_01]: medical legalization in 2006, 2007,
in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still didn't have dispensaries that
could work with children that were open.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, she's published.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mom has published on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she did a series for Slate Magazine
called Why I Give My Nine-Year-Old
[SPEAKER_01]: Autistic Son Pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the series has now been in four parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great description of her journey,
her personal journey with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's very honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a complete fix, and that's not
what she presents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's given her family and her life the
ability towards something approaching
[SPEAKER_01]: normalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to live in fear of those
violent, aggressive outbursts every
[SPEAKER_01]: moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her son's actually performing much better
in school, finally making progress,
[SPEAKER_01]: finally communicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really turned their lives around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as part of the experience in treating
patients with epilepsy, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: the epilepsy world really opened up very
quickly after Sanjay Gupta's documentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number of phone calls was
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, if you look at the rates of
autism and epilepsy combined, there's very
[SPEAKER_01]: common overlap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as many as 25% of children with autism
will have epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many kids, somewhere around 15% of all
kids with epilepsy have an autism spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder, depending on the study you look
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these two are shared in common,
very commonly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see two peaks in terms of when these
present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have some patients who first
present with epilepsy and later autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: A typical example would be a child with
infantile spasms or Dravet syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very common to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their seizures present at a very
young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have some who present with
epilepsy much later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some who first had autism and later
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a variety of different
situations where that could occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so of the children with epilepsy who
were medically refractory to treatment,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, by the way, roughly 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're looking at the total
epilepsy population in childhood is close
[SPEAKER_01]: to 1%, of which about a third are
medically refractory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of similar in autism,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the core symptoms we're trying to
treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The children are medically refractory.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't respond to the traditional
treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of overlap in these
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I start to see more epilepsy
patients, and I've now treated in the
[SPEAKER_01]: range of about 40% to 50%, for epilepsy,
within that population I have more than a
[SPEAKER_01]: handful that have also had autism and had
core symptoms of aggression as being one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the major components of what we were
trying to treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of those, as I compiled my data,
which I had slides for you, but we were
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at roughly 80% or more that had
seen some improvement in the behavioral
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects, not just in the seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're seeing a combined improvement
and this is a very important population,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, to look at for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that the autism and epilepsy
co-population, they share some
[SPEAKER_01]: underpinnings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are not two separate disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really, there's one single
unifying diagnosis here, and you're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: a variety of different diagnoses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it becomes increasingly important to
understand what the nature of that
[SPEAKER_01]: underlying diagnosis is and how each
individual may respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So examples, and there are many,
but one of the most common examples that
[SPEAKER_01]: we look at would be Fragile X,
which is really an issue of
[SPEAKER_01]: neurotransmitters, so M-Glory 3 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in those cases, in Fragile X in
particular, you see mouse models that have
[SPEAKER_01]: shown response in terms of some of the
features of anxiety to cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment, to cannabidiol as a treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there may be specific therapies
geared towards Fragile X in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: For other types of conditions,
you have mTOR conditions, such as tuberous
[SPEAKER_01]: sclerosis or neurofibromatosis,
another very common population that has
[SPEAKER_01]: both autism and epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, mTOR is listed on the pathways
that we had seen earlier today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have neuraminologic conditions,
things like NMDA receptor encephalitis,
[SPEAKER_01]: very rare condition, but there are many
other types of autoantibodies that might
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute to both epilepsy and autism,
things like antithyroid antibodies or
[SPEAKER_01]: antigad antibodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, looking at the, I mean,
interestingly, antigad antibodies,
[SPEAKER_01]: gad is an important component of GABA
synthesis, and antigad antibodies are
[SPEAKER_01]: causative for type 1 diabetes,
which we saw earlier today slides of
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but they can also lead to
refractory epilepsy in some patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as you go through these,
of course, DREV-A or SCN1A, there's a fair
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be more of a channelopathy
condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fair percentage of patients in
general who also have autism, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to become critically important to
follow those developmental outcomes as
[SPEAKER_01]: many of them are treated for their
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of what's needed for this,
so as we think about designing studies,
[SPEAKER_01]: it becomes critically important to look at
development as one of the outcome
[SPEAKER_01]: measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask many of the parents that I see
what is the single most important thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I could fix one thing, I'd say more
than half would say it's not the seizure,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the development that they'd want
fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we can improve development and
seizures, that would really be
[SPEAKER_01]: revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the medications we have for
seizures do nothing for development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to have anything that would
actually improve both would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: would really be a major change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to follow development in all
these studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not an outcome that's currently
being looked at, but it's an important
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that would be critically
important to follow would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of EG abnormalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we call spike wave discharges that
you see on EG when you're not looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: seizures, the frequency of those spike
waves and how that translates to
[SPEAKER_01]: developmental outcome and developmental
improvement would be another important
[SPEAKER_01]: outcome measure to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have enough data there,
but I have for my epilepsy population,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a fair number where I've done
before and after EGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm in the process of counting spikes,
which is not a very fun task to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit laborious, but it's,
I think, important to understand what are
[SPEAKER_01]: the effects of the EG, not just the
seizure counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those outcome measures coupled with
better detailed understanding of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and the underlying mechanisms of
each child so we can better understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what works best for each child.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing I'd leave you with is that
in autism, as well as epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_01]: we really, each child is completely unique
and is completely individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so think of snowflakes in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to think of a butterfly as a
great analogy because we hope to see that
[SPEAKER_01]: metamorphosis and see the child sort of
take hold and grow wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so development, again, remains a
critical piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: But each child is so unique and so trying
to determine that individualized
[SPEAKER_01]: medication for each child is something
that has become far more complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't really do that without that
understanding of their individual
[SPEAKER_01]: biological underpinnings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the synopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did have some really great diagrams
and slides and pictures, if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: believe me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciate it.
We
[SPEAKER_00]: have a couple minutes for some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a question, please step up
to the microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Kirsten Velasco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to specify when you say
you have results from, let's say,
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trials or just single trials,
you say CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think all of us want to know,
is this a whole plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it isolated 98%?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it synthetic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So OK, so what I'm referring to in my own
patients who I've seen and treated,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with the Slater Center in
Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the patients when I was practicing
in Rhode Island, I'm still licensed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with the Compassion Center very
closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily, many of the kids were,
for epilepsy, many of the kids initially
[SPEAKER_01]: started with AC-DC, usually in about a 20
to 1 ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are now using a strain
called auto number 2, which is a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more like a 30 or 40 to 1 ratio of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, in epilepsy, I'd say the
standard approach that we'd use would be
[SPEAKER_01]: to start them around a 20 to 1 ratio and
increase them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd start around a quarter milligram per
pound per day, do that for about a week or
[SPEAKER_01]: two, go to half, go to three quarters,
and then to one milligram per pound per
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, as you get to about one milligram
per pound per day, you start to see
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we bring that up to somewhere in the
two to three milligram per pound per day
[SPEAKER_01]: range for a lot of kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you get to those ranges,
depending on their response, you may
[SPEAKER_01]: choose to add THC to their regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just a rule of thumb
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, then we're checking their
levels of other anti-seizure meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're following EG data and also carefully
monitoring their seizure control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I talk about data, I'm just
talking about my own patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to compile what my own
experience has been.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the most refractory patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to understate the
importance of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Dravet syndrome, for example,
Charlotte Dravet went back and looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: her original patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somewhere around 20% had died by the
time they were a young adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not insignificant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a serious, serious condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to downplay that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have seen a better than 50% seizure
reduction in the majority of these
[SPEAKER_01]: patients who have responded literally to
nothing else that's ever come their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: As more of a lay person and listening to
you talk about an epidemic and autism and
[SPEAKER_00]: aggression related with autism and its
treatment, could you give me an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, though, of what you see as
the reason or basis or causation of this
[SPEAKER_00]: epidemic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a whole other talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gets so complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would just say, to simplify it,
we are a product of our genetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be silly not to explore both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our genetics is influenced by
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Epigenetics is a major factor in
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it would be foolish not to
think that both factors play a major role
[SPEAKER_01]: for most kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as to the specific environmental
causes, and we see a variety of genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: causes, that's complex enough as to what
environmental causes and environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: factors might be out there, that's a whole
other talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: The title of your talk also references
legal hurdles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if you could spend a moment
or two explaining some of those hurdles
[SPEAKER_03]: that you had and how you surmounted them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of a whole other talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll get into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to do something on autism
instead, because I actually think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a major growing area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the legal challenges to either
epilepsy or autism as a clinician are
[SPEAKER_01]: major.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because first of all, I have a DEA
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't practice or bill without my
DEA license.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEA is a federal agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm specifically prohibited from
recommending or prescribing any treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: that is Schedule I.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do so, I could lose my license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that means my language, even though
I'm really over, nobody here is from the
[SPEAKER_01]: DEA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have any agents?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I say this, so I can't,
I mean, ethically, how could I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: patient where, what we're being asked to
do from the state level is simply to say
[SPEAKER_01]: this patient has a qualifying diagnosis
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have no discussion further as to what
specifically to try, what dose to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to introduce it, what to do with the
other meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an expert in epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen and treated a lot of kids with
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of know how this goes in terms of
how you introduce a med.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you taper a med and how you follow
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be really unfair for me to put
that part of the management onto a
[SPEAKER_01]: compassion center or onto a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have to be directly involved in
that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the state doesn't seem to think that's
a good idea for some inexplicable reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing that's really important
to me as a clinician is that the hospitals
[SPEAKER_01]: are not on board with this at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hospitals also have DEA regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of federal regulations,
a lot of federal funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's zero interest in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the hospitals in dispensing or holding
or having anything to do with any cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that we're forced to,
you have a couple choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have a patient with intractable
epilepsy and suddenly take their meds away
[SPEAKER_01]: abruptly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which as an epileptologist I could say is
not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really risks harming the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what we're being asked to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if I actually actively recommend that
they use it in the hospital, I would get
[SPEAKER_01]: into quite a bit of trouble with
administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we could do a don't ask, don't tell
policy which is kind of where we've been.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't ask, don't tell really is not a,
I mean that's a temporary measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not gonna play out very well over
the long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need something better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nurses and doctors really need to know
what's going on with their patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this can influence our other
decision making if we're not aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what's being given.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need, obviously we need this whole
thing corrected and a schedule change
