[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Dr. Nicole Goche.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole is a professor and extension
specialist at the University of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her program focuses on disease management
of specialty crops including fruits,
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: In her extension role, she develops
educational and outreach programs to help
[SPEAKER_00]: growers manage disease through
identification, understanding of patho
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, and integration of management
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her research program focuses on a range of
hemp diseases including Fusarium head
[SPEAKER_00]: blight as well as stand establishment and
seed borne transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole's resources can be found at the
University of Kentucky website which I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: include a link in the show description so
that it's easy to find and she's also on
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook and Twitter at KY Plant Disease
and on YouTube at Nicole Goche.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole's team at the University of
Kentucky recently published a fact sheet
[SPEAKER_00]: about Fusarium and hemp plants which
caught my eye considering many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators we work with at medicinal
genomics struggle with that pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discuss the
financial impact of Fusarium on hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis crops, the public health concerns
due to Fusarium's production of harmful
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxins, how growers often misidentify
Fusarium head blight as botrytis due to
[SPEAKER_00]: similar symptoms leading to ineffective
management strategies, environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that increase the likelihood of
a Fusarium infection, challenges for
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention and management including a lack
of effective fungicides and resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars, and future research to better
understand Fusarium spread, genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, and management techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation with
Nicole, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Rare Earth Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare Earth Genomics is a dynamic
partnership formed with Texas A&M
[SPEAKER_00]: AgriLife, one of the world's leading
research institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: to accelerate hemp research and create
tools for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their mission is to increase the
likelihood of a successful harvest for
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers through genetic analysis and
rigorous environmental testing of vigorous
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more at RareEarthGenomics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Nicole
[SPEAKER_00]: Goche.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Nicole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to talk with you today
about the work that you and your team are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing to better understand plant
pathogens, pathogens affecting hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your team recently published a fact sheet
about Fusarium in hemp plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we are going to dive into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that's only one of many
pathogens that your team studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe to start, can you provide a brief
overview of the most common diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting hemp crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why did you decide to focus on
Fusarium this time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so hemp in Kentucky, most
everywhere, is grown outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I look at cannabis in general,
when I look at hemp or high THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: low THC, whether it's floral or grain,
or fiber, we essentially have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look at it from an outdoor
standpoint, what pathogens can infect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can go on the flip side and we can
look at indoor cannabis or indoor hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: however you want to phrase it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an indoor environment is going to have
its own set of pathogens because you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a very different climate system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in plant pathology, most of our
diseases are driven by not just the
[SPEAKER_01]: presence of the pathogen, but also the
climate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in an outdoor hemp, we see stand
establishment problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can have pythium root rot,
whatever the nature of the previous crop
[SPEAKER_01]: or the history of that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could see a lot of seaborne seedling
diseases like Fusarium crown and root rot,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not Fusarium wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Fusarium salonii-based Fusaria.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see a Rhizoctonia crown and root
rot, and we can also see some pythium root
[SPEAKER_01]: rots that can affect seeds or seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get into a larger plant,
everybody knows the leaf diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a history of kind of all those
leaf diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what interests everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And leaf diseases, Septoria leaf spot,
Anthracnose, Cercospora leaf spot,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the big one, Bipolaris leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those, we've been working on those for
many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working on hemp since 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we started seeing this head
blight in grain hemp, there was so much
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about Botrytis, Botrytis gray mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like always the talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everyone was seeing all of this
fuzzy growth inside of either their flower
[SPEAKER_01]: heads or their seed heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just automatically saying,
I've got Botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And knowing that pathogen, because it is
ubiquitous, it affects many different
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of plants, I knew it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we go a little bit deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we realized that we had a
very widespread disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just the blighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so blighting is when it kind of turns
brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just the blighting in the disease,
but also the potential for mycotoxins from
[SPEAKER_01]: those pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of took us down a road that
we've done a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just starting to publish that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we've been working with Fusarium
head blight since about 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was I hearing that correctly that
growers were misdiagnosing Fusarium as
[SPEAKER_00]: Botrytis?
[SPEAKER_01]: The danger of the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The danger of diagnosing by symptoms and
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was just kind of this blanket
understanding that if it's fuzzy and
[SPEAKER_01]: white, it must be Botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was not.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I rarely find Botrytis in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm in a more southern climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could definitely see a lot more
Botrytis in the northern states.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we overall see Botrytis more in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But any of that fuzzy growth I'm seeing in
Kentucky, Midwestern states, mid-Atlantic
[SPEAKER_01]: states, and definitely south of me,
it's almost exclusively Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that affect how one kind of
tries to manage the disease, if it's one
[SPEAKER_00]: or the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, both of the pathogens are true
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And overall, they need about the same
temperatures and humidity to complete
[SPEAKER_01]: their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Botrytis likes very high humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 85% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got to be very wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Botrytis is more of an opportunistic
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it infects, it's infecting,
it begins on something like necrotic
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a dying leaf or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of more opportunistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas Fusarium is pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's highly pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can invade a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus Botrytis is more of that kind of
humidity lover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it needs you to open the door for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can't just bulldoze its way into
those plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you describe how Fusarium affects hemp
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it infect and what is sort of the
progression?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's start with Fusarium is a
genus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very large genus with a lot of
complexes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of species within a Fusarium
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people, when they hear Fusarium,
they think of Fusarium wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's Fusarium oxysperum,
different special forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Fusarium oxysperum, or Fusarium wilt,
is a vascular disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts in the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's born.
[SPEAKER_01]: It moves its way up the vascular system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it causes wilt because of just
blocking water and nutrient uptake to the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the plant and necrosis of the
xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium headlight is a Fusarium
gruminiorum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is infecting flowers and grain
from the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very different pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember earlier, I talked about
Fusarium salani, a root and crown rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are three major Fusarium species
that affect hemp or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium headlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Fusarium headlight pathogens,
we have identified five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium gruminiorum is the common one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that you read so much that
affects wheat and cereal crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fusarium gruminiorum will infect
flowers and grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have found it to infect growing tips
and leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But primarily, it's going to be a flower
and grain disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different species of Fusarium will kind
of attack the plant from different angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to not just say Fusarium, because when
we started working on Fusarium headlight,
[SPEAKER_01]: the assumption was that it was the
Fusarium oxysperum, the Fusarium wilt
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very, very different,
even though that first name, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: that genus is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the economic impacts
of Fusarium on hemp cultivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fusarium headlight, as we call it,
will blight out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And blight is kind of a rapid necrosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what that kind of term means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium headlight will blight out a
flower head or a seed head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So early shattering, more brittle flowers
or grain heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can have it at very low levels as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, I mentioned mycotoxins
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fusarium griminierum produces two
different mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a mycotoxin is a toxin produced by a
fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mycotoxins, there's a history of
mycotoxins in Fusarium species.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trichothecines, for example,
that can cause vomiting, digestion issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: both in humans and in animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in hemp, I'm sorry, in any feed,
it's highly regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even low levels of disease can cause
high levels of toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we're not
regulating here in the U.S., not in hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: not in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone is really interested in
looking at aflatoxin or some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: other toxins, which we're not finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are finding those Fusarium
mycotoxins from the head blight pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, all the Fusarium out there,
but that's our focus because that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we feel is the most
important, especially as hemp as an animal
[SPEAKER_01]: feed is coming onto market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned that Fusarium could be
there in low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So might it sort of escape some visual
detection and have some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxins present?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to spill the beans a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My graduate student just came in with some
year one data from two different fields
[SPEAKER_01]: here in central Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had Fusarium head blight at about
five percent severity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about that whole seed head and
about visually five percent of that head
[SPEAKER_01]: had symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very low, something that a grower would
probably overlook, something that I might
[SPEAKER_01]: have said, oh, well, and he ended up
detecting Dawn, deoxynovalinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ended up detecting Dawn at levels that
are above the threshold for human
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption in other grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, we don't have that
threshold for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that that threshold, I mean,
that would have failed QC in a cereal
[SPEAKER_01]: grain market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're finding those high levels of
toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a year of drought and extreme heat
this year, we had low levels of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is not not being tested now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those mycotoxins aren't being tested for
in hemp products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was one of our delays in in
releasing some of our data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to double check and triple check
and quadruple check because we didn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to send a scare in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to make really sure that what we
were seeing was a trend and it wasn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated incidents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not we're looking at a lot of
microbial testing in hemp in some states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like there's a huge interest in
aflatoxin, right, and some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have we just don't have those
regulations in hemp anyway, unless it's at
[SPEAKER_01]: a state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are only a few states that are
regulating those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not talking about Fusarium
toxins, especially not the triclophesines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that was going to be my
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are those regulations coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they at a federal level or a state
level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, we could do a whole
podcast on hemp regulations, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know some states are testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we hope that we can get the data
out that's that's both going to help the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp industry, not hurt the hemp industry,
but also make sure that we are producing
[SPEAKER_01]: safe products for our end use or end
consumers, which could be animals or
[SPEAKER_01]: plants or humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've kind of set the stage for
the stakes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about prevention?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the best practices for preventing
Fusarium in different growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the million dollar question,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So so what we know about Fusarium
griminiarum is the most popular is the
[SPEAKER_01]: most common species that's causing
Fusarium headlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I say Fusarium griminiarum,
that's kind of the big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know what we know about Fusarium
griminiarum and other headlight producing
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know from wheat and barley and cereals
and corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we base a lot of things off of that
until we can generate our own data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in wheat, so I'm going to give you a
life cycle because, you know, nerdy
[SPEAKER_01]: pathologists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in wheat, wheat is a cool season crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really kind of infects during in
thesis, which is when that anther is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of poking out of that wheat flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when infection occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Kentucky, for example, that's
happening in May.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're harvesting wheat in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got a hemp crop that really
is not going in until July in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time hemp starts flowering and
is ultra susceptible to to Fusarium
[SPEAKER_01]: infection, it's July, August.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we having this two month or
more division between that that wheat
[SPEAKER_01]: infection and that hemp infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what our research has told us is that
in in fields where there was wheat or near
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat, we have a lot higher incidence of
disease and toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so there's a lot more Fusarium
griminiarum when there was wheat in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vicinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're finding out now is that
wheat cover crops, even though they were
[SPEAKER_01]: terminated before they flowered,
are still inducing a much higher amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't remember your question now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're trying to figure
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are all the roles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do know about Fusarium,
again, from the cereal grains research,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that those spores as knidia can get
really high up into the atmosphere and
[SPEAKER_01]: they can move very long distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one's safe, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No greenhouse is safe if you've got a
vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the closer we are, that proximity to
any wheat or any other any other host
[SPEAKER_01]: plant seems to be really inducing a higher
level of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is there any sort of sprays or
bioagents that can be applied to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent an infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, so I'm going to back up just
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we do have we don't have any
conventional fungicides or pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we definitely don't for high THC
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have any products anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of organics, we've been looking
at a lot of biologicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, we're not finding anything
that is that is effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few years of field studies and
we're trying lots of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're throwing a lot of things to see what
sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just don't think we're getting
anything right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my questions here, how does it
spread between plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like it's airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are these are spores that can
move long distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, think about when when disease
spreads anyway, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When those spores spread, it's usually
wind, wind driven rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you kind of think about it and we
can look at so kind of overlaying weather
[SPEAKER_01]: data with some of our spore dropping data,
we can see that when there's a rain event,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what we'll see spikes in disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that that's really making a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a drought year,
a calm year, we can have a lot lower
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we have a lot more rain,
we can have a lot more disease because
[SPEAKER_01]: remember, fungi need at least 70 percent
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need leaf wetness and they need
moderate temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things cool down when it gets cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though it's hot and dry in the
middle of the summer, if we got a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of cloudy rainy days, or even drizzly,
it's enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that goes back to what you were
talking about earlier of indoor versus
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these in an indoor environment,
these are sort of conditions that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: control for or you're not susceptible to
the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But greenhouses are a lot or indoor
environments rather.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just kind of lump those together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor environments are a lot more humid,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're not exchanging that air.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more we exchange air, the more we let
things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have identified Fusarium headlight in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've identified it in flowers,
by the way, for those of you who are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing only to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have identified it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also know that it can be seed
borne.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the beginning of it's the beginning
of a new research trajectory.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know that it can be seed borne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we're we're testing commercial seed
lots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not found it in commercial seed
lots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But coming from harvested grain in our
plots, we are finding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're kind of we're kind of at a
crossroads there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a few years before we have that
data.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the telltale signs of
Fusarium in hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are there early detection tools
available?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, there are no tools available,
but a really nice hand lens or a cheap
[SPEAKER_01]: hand lens or a magnifying glass,
if that that's what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to look inside that inside that
head, and I'm just going to use the word
[SPEAKER_01]: head in general for flowers or grain,
looking inside, kind of looking at that
[SPEAKER_01]: stem, looking at that rake is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it's going to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more dense the seed head,
the more the more humid it is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you kind of separate out those
flowers or those, it usually starts when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you kind of separate out those
flowers, just kind of pull it apart and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can kind of see that fuzzy white
growth in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really that's how we look for
it now to identify which species it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always got to come back to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always got to go into a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see that those fuzzy seed
head, those fuzzy growth that mycelia in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to have to pull that
those flowers apart and look inside
[SPEAKER_01]: between those racings.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do you do after that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've you've identified it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this this plant has Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's sort of the next steps?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're research, so we're trying to kill
our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our next steps are very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a grower, I mean, unfortunately,
we're in a place where there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have resistant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're looking at cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're kind of realizing that some are
more susceptible than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but really, if I'm working with a
grower, we're talking about next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do next year?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're making sure that we don't have a
cereal crop in the vicinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're definitely saying not to not to
rotate with a susceptible crop and not to
[SPEAKER_01]: use a cereal cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something very new because we
thought, OK, you know, we're burning it
[SPEAKER_01]: down and we're we're crimping it down long
before flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that infection is present,
even if it hasn't sort of emerged in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a lot more we have a lot more
research to do in that in that vein.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to mention before I forget,
we did a two year study to look at latent
[SPEAKER_01]: infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a latent infection is that dormant
infection, that time between infection and
[SPEAKER_01]: symptom development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were looking at floral hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we weren't going to grain stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we planted hemp every two weeks
from April until I think September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we sampled every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in theory, we had we had every growth
stage at every week through the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at weather data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at growth stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we found is that we can we are
detecting latent infection six weeks or
[SPEAKER_01]: more before symptom development.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're detecting it long before flower
initiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're finding it very early in the
season, I think as early as May for those
[SPEAKER_01]: early planted, early planted hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, that was the same time that
wheat was in the field, not in our plots,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and to overlay weather data,
what we're finding out is hemp does come
[SPEAKER_01]: become more susceptible as it gets older,
as it reaches maturity and as it starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce the interest as reproductive
phases, but also to layer those rain
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we see huge spikes of fungal
DNA within those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were looking at the DNA in latent
infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the moral of that story is it doesn't
matter when it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are times where it's more
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have more infection and pathogen DNA in
that plant, which ultimately becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: diseased.
[SPEAKER_01]: But any time infection can happen any
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really scary because in a lot
of your cereals that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're always targeting that in thesis
when those anthers start protruding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with hemp, it looks like latent
infection is a lot more common than we
[SPEAKER_01]: expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's going to take a lot of
rethinking on what a recommendation would
[SPEAKER_01]: look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when those symptoms at what stage
in the plants development, do those
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms tend to emerge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it during sort of the flowering
reproductive stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so it symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So disease is what we call symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the infection is when we can detect the
DNA inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that with qPCR?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, with qPCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody listening that's quantitative
PCR, it can detect really low levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA from plant tissue, whatever tissue we
choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that case, it was leaves growing
tips, male flowers, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can become infected and female flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what was your question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think we were talking about the
latent identifying a latent infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can just I can just skip to the next
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't all fall on a tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think just for the purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, now I remember we were talking about
when do the symptoms emerge at what stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of development of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we said it was during sort of
the reproductive stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the later you go into the reproductive
stages, of course, induced by a rain
[SPEAKER_01]: event, but the heavier and more dense that
seed head or flower head is, the more
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture it's holding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot more symptoms in
grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there must be something physiological
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I don't have any data to
back that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just observational.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely the bigger and denser and
heavier it is at a rain event or like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, when it starts cooling off late in
the summer and you kind of get those
[SPEAKER_01]: foggy, dewy mornings, that's kind of the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So add moisture and it really it really
gets worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the longer you go into the season in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think any of us in the Northeast
who have tried to grow hemp or cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that once the fall hits,
when you have those dense, dense flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and those cool mornings, cool,
wet mornings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the fuzz starts to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, going back to the latent
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can a plant with a latent infection infect
another plant or are they not infectious?
[SPEAKER_01]: That technically that answer is no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So infection occurs when a spore,
a Canadian, which is an asexual spore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a spore moves, so disease has to
develop, the fungus has to spore you late
[SPEAKER_01]: and release that spore and that spore land
on another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that spore lands on the other
plant, they must have moderate
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures and free water in order for
that infection to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a latent infection plant, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're finding is that if there is
latent infection, it means there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: spore deposition event in some at some
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we usually have widespread.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe one latent infection plant ends
up having disease symptoms in two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: and another one might develop symptoms in
four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what those connections are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not tracked individual spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not tracked movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you you touched on before genetic
resistance and that there are no resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics out there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are there certain strains or certain
physical characteristics of the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: can make them less susceptible to an
infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we we're accumulating data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of a multistate group that plants the same
group of cultivars across many states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have my working group has tapped
into that whole network.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to start trying to
understand which of those cultivars these
[SPEAKER_01]: are hemp cultivars, by the way,
which of those cultivars are more
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we have found anecdotally over
and over is that the more heavy and dense
[SPEAKER_01]: seed head is, the more disease you'll
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you've always got those
spindly ones with that spacing in between
[SPEAKER_01]: the race seems there must be more air
circulation going there and not having
[SPEAKER_01]: that humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bigger, chunkier seed heads are
definitely going to have a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: disease than the more spindly ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would imagine it'd be the same for
for flower as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I mean, that again, that kind of
goes back to those principles of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathology, that free water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That indirect, you know, not being able to
penetrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, with a flower, flowers are
are wet and sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when you get to the later season
with the seed, I mean, they're they're dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that infection event probably taking
place when you've got that higher
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess looking forward here,
what are your sort of your next steps or
[SPEAKER_00]: projects that you're working on to better
understand this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my graduate students,
it has transformed the fungus with green
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorescent protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he is going to track infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking to see whether an
infected seed can actually carry the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen and if it can move its way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are a couple of the things that
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking for connections and
better identification of DOM, the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycotoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's especially hard and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking at other mycotoxins as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've completed some surveys,
those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to look more into the animal
feed market, because it seems like that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're going to have that bulk of of
hemp product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could really be taking some of this
Fusarium far and wide and have probably
[SPEAKER_01]: the most effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are kind of our big our big
projects in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're continuing a lot of our research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a lot of our field studies,
the spore trapping, those types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have looked at we've done some genetic
analyses on the Fusarium that's infecting
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp, and it is the same one that's
affecting wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that those populations are the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that's our immediate look forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot more questions,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if you're using spent hemp,
like after the oil's been pressed from
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using byproducts like animal
feed, you know, do you have that movement
[SPEAKER_01]: of those mycotoxins from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is what a stored hemp look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done some stored hemp studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is stored hemp look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is that timing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you dry down those seeds or those
flowers first, to a certain degree,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, less than, you know, 15 or 10
percent moisture, do you stop that dawn of
[SPEAKER_01]: toxin production?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what's happening in wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can we dry it down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we dry it down more quickly and stop
that toxin production?
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of questions, a million questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to prioritize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an extension professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my my questions connect directly to
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always trying to solve those grower
problems first and then doing the fun
[SPEAKER_01]: curiosity science in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, winding down here, Nicole,
please share any other links or studies or
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that you think would be helpful
to the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to put the links right in the
show description so people can easily find
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, definitely will.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some new publications in the
pipeline right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check back on some of these resources
and these links that I'm going to send.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way you'll be able to see kind of
as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Nicole.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for taking the time to talk
to us about Fusarium and hemp diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for doing this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
