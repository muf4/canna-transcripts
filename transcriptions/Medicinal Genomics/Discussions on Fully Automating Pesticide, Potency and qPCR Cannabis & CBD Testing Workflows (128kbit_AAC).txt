[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand I can kick off shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Toby Astle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for Perkin Almer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the global market manager for cannabis
and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my job to listen to our clients to
understand the challenges they're facing
[SPEAKER_00]: in testing cannabis and hemp and hopefully
deliver technologies and the support to
[SPEAKER_00]: get better data quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not a testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a technology provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by a quick show of hands in the room,
who is currently testing their own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or outsourcing their cannabis to
a third party lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do some science 101
probably in this talk, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably keep this to be a little
shorter than 30 minutes, but my goal here
[SPEAKER_00]: is to show you some of the technologies
available to testing labs or quality
[SPEAKER_00]: control labs to help get better data
quality in more time-efficient manners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, what you heard Jeff just
speak about is understand where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: standardize some of the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of activities out there,
but they're not always public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've all gathered in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from various continents and parts
of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, cannabis and hemp is an
exciting space for us to all be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are now global markets available for
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, some of them very different to
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we've seen is our international
team really embrace this and share
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge to deliver answers faster than
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a chemist, cannabis is one of the most
challenging matrices to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no plant that is the same as its
neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that presents challenges in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have seen a huge amount of
variety of products derived from cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: oil and hemp oil, which in itself can pose
testing challenges once it gets to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal is to understand what these
product types look like and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: behave differently as they are tested and
provide guidance so that we can generate
[SPEAKER_00]: better data so people can make the right
decisions, particularly when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: administrative medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to talk to you today is
very much focused on the laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think this can be looked at in other
areas of the vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we'll look at today is optimizing
the core foundations in a lab to generate
[SPEAKER_00]: good data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my eyes, that looks like the three
we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the choice of the soft goods,
the reagents and consumables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all suppliers are created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these assays or statements with
compliance requirements are incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: demanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need sensitive equipment and
instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, cannabis labs are reaching a
maturity where we're seeing thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: samples being tested a month, and that's
generating huge amounts of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, as Jeff just mentioned,
that data needs to be made available if
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So managing that data in a timely and
qualified manner is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'll also say is, particularly as
we come out of the pandemic, we've seen a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of challenges around the staffing or
the personnel in labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a lot of delays
ultimately in getting samples processed or
[SPEAKER_00]: data produced because the staffing hasn't
been available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd like to add at the end is how
we've adopted automation to take some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the burden off the staff and generate
quality data in a timely manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, cannabis is a complex
matrix, and it's full of fats,
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll, terpenes, cannabinoids,
and contaminants like heavy metals and
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a scientist, it's key to really
understand what's gonna maybe catch you up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lab or work with a partner that's
already encountered and developed
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies to overcome them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know testing is essential,
and depending on what market you're
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on, or what you're looking into,
we know it's key and core to generating a
[SPEAKER_00]: safe product for the consumer,
both in the medicinal and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not hard to look at some of the
press releases or the media or the data
[SPEAKER_00]: available to show that bad samples are out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the responsibility of the
industry to accept that testing is
[SPEAKER_00]: essential and empower the labs to be able
to do that effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an exciting time for us to
understand how these regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements differ and support each of
them in the various states and countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will focus on for the next few
minutes is the pesticide and mycotoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: testing requirements in cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on where you're coming from
or what you're testing, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: patchwork of requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, for pesticides and
cannabis in all the markets across the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have different regulatory
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may think you have it easier in a
state that has a lower number of total
[SPEAKER_00]: analytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the detection requirements of
those could be quite a lot lower than,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, a lot of time has to be spent
on these methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a new lab, that's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be generating COAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've taken that responsibility on and
developed these methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fit for purpose for these various
state markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll focus on California because it
does still, to this day, have one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most comprehensive lists in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get to the instrumentation,
I just want to take a step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of discussions in the
field where ultimately the data isn't what
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab or the client expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this means is there needs to be a
robust quality control or compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: framework in that lab to understand where
potentially an error was introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't just for cannabis labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for all labs in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see is that a huge amount
of time is associated with preparing the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample for the analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we see a lot of
cumbersome steps typically done by
[SPEAKER_00]: inexperienced personnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a small slip at the beginning can have
a significant impact on the final data
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done is looked at this
workflow, taken one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging assays to date, which is
pesticide analysis, and tried to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab's chances of success by bringing
technology to their lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at the incumbent or the
legacy scenario for sample preparation,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we see as the norm is labs having to
utilize a large number of suppliers to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet their soft goods needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to source reagents, consumables,
lab ware for multiple vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also have to spend
considerable time on the bench preparing,
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing, diluting, transcribing,
recording, inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, for a busy lab, can take up a
significant amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw this paradigm and wanted to
change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we were able to do is put all
those steps into one kit, take a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the heavy lifting and the wet chemistry
that's typically done in that sample
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation procedure, and do that at the
factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that now we can supply an ISO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a certified reference material
reagent kit to cannabis labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have more confidence in the
calibration and the quality control
[SPEAKER_00]: standards they're going to use for the
final determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen a lot of interest in making
lives easier and starting with the
[SPEAKER_00]: reagents, which are instrument agnostic
has been a great step forward for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to talk about this offline
at the booth after my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'll say is we've tried to
aggregate all the pesticide and mycotoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements in this one kit for the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently we have 77 pesticides and
five mycotoxins down to one parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: billion, all the way up to 250 parts per
billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at your state requirements
and see that it includes all or some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these pesticides, you know you can use
this kit out of the box with really no
[SPEAKER_00]: prep time to improve your data quality and
improve your lab efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have included internal standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those that maybe aren't as
familiar, because of the challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix cannabis is, we often use a number
of analytical techniques to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: data quality or understand where we'll see
suppression effects from the matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those that we suggest and
recommend is the use of internal
[SPEAKER_00]: standards, which are similar molecules,
but they are isotopally labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a little bit heavier in their
mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can identify them more specifically
in the assay and account for any
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations in that test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is ready to use out of the
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to see the feedback from
various labs that have struggled in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past in getting their reagent prep
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: No lab is equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we've summarized the time savings
from a kit like this, and you see up to 90
[SPEAKER_00]: plus minutes of time savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a busy lab environment running 500
samples a week, this ends up helping them
[SPEAKER_00]: out a lot in getting through to the more
important steps like data review or COA
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together with our instrumentation,
we're excited to provide the complete
[SPEAKER_00]: workflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get into the instrument
per se, but we have established these
[SPEAKER_00]: verified methods that work side by side
with the reagents and the hardware to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: the testing needs in cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very confident in the method,
and I want to be able to demonstrate that
[SPEAKER_00]: where possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We participate in the emerald proficiency
test yearly, and last year received our
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021 badge for this assay in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I was mentioning earlier,
is that we're seeing a maturity and the
[SPEAKER_00]: volumes across the US and in Canada get to
be quite sizable for labs trying to handle
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of samples per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having cannabis being deemed essential
during the pandemic has only increased the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of samples that have needed to be
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an exciting time to be a scientist
in this space, as every day, new samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: new product types are being manufactured
and sold, and they have to be tested
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we saw this as being a challenge
because as I mentioned, during the
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic in particular, labs were
struggling to find the right personnel or
[SPEAKER_00]: the right amount of personnel,
and they were really looking to leverage
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to get them ahead of the sample
preparation challenges they were seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perconel was a big company, we do a lot of
work in the diagnostics clinical side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, and we were able to leverage a
very mature automation platform and
[SPEAKER_00]: develop something specific for cannabis
labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been working with labs and the
team for the last year and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm very excited to be able to provide
a fully autonomous workflow to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: labs now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before where they may have had two,
three, four people preparing samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: preparing reagents, that can be now
replaced by a machine, an instrument,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll share some slides on what it does
shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that if we can take some of
the human influence or human error out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the workflow, the data quality is likely
gonna go up, and it's gonna be far more
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The instrument doesn't get hung over,
it doesn't get tied, it does the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing every day, day in and day out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this development we believe is gonna
be important for the sustainability of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hemp testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to make sure we weren't just
tackling the hard goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the instrumentation now,
we have the automation, but that data is
[SPEAKER_00]: essential in maintaining the credibility
of that data that results and also
[SPEAKER_00]: communicating that data to the client or
the lab manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at this holistically and
realized we needed to develop software to
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate digitally between each
platform in the workflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that starts with weighing the sample
on the balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll talk to a number of labs where
they'll tell you that, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we wrote down the wrong weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a massive cascade into the
quality of the data at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to now take the data off that balance
automatically with the right value offers
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more security in that lab workflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to summarize what the platform
does, if you've been around a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: testing lab for pesticide and microtoxins,
you will have seen samples be homogenized,
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted, centrifuged, vortexed,
filtered, diluted, all very manual steps
[SPEAKER_00]: up until now, but they can now be
accommodated on this platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is you put your flower sample
in at the beginning press go and you come
[SPEAKER_00]: back and take your small LCMS file off at
the end and run the quantitation after
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our turnaround time is about 48
samples in two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very happy as we're seeing that
being a lot faster than what it typically
[SPEAKER_00]: takes labs to prepare that amount
manually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a quick snapshot on the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just showing the reproducibility
of the automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's far more consistent than a human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which gives us the confidence to meet some
of the stringent state regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements that are in place for
cannabis and hemp testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we know that every state has a
different testing requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was important for us to make sure we
were running the technology on the right
[SPEAKER_00]: application to meet the right
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a summary of the various
states and some of the differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: their action limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are higher, some are lower,
but collectively we can support all these
[SPEAKER_00]: as needed in your market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an eye chart,
but this gives you the data for the
[SPEAKER_00]: California list, showing that we can
successfully use an automation platform to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet the DCC's requirements in a busy lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I focused on pesticide and micro
toxins, but we appreciate that a busy
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hemp lab is gonna have a
number of workflows or testing assays that
[SPEAKER_00]: could also be automated We have had a lot
of success looking at the molecular QPCR
[SPEAKER_00]: prep using a similar platform as I just
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can work with the kit providers like
medicinal genomics and the QPCR
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumentation providers to integrate
that automation into the software as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For myself, on the platform I just showed,
we are automating the pesticide and micro
[SPEAKER_00]: toxin and now the potency prep shortly
this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So giving labs a lot more options into
improving their throughput and their
[SPEAKER_00]: workflows with technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, I just wanna touch on
software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that went to grad school or those
that have been around labs recognize lab
[SPEAKER_00]: notebooks being stacked to the ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that in a compliance
environment that's not ideal or really
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took a lot of the work we've done in
the farmer and the food and the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceutical space and looked at the
frameworks for ISO, GMP compliant
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that are now being required in
certain cannabis markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: ISO being the more predominant one in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMP being very common now in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were able to use that framework and
apply it to the state's specifics of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hemp to deliver a software
that now manages and controls access to
[SPEAKER_00]: that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a software as a service from
Perkinoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a cloud-based software that
really starts at the beginning where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can take your order entry, look at your
inventory, your samples you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: process that day and then follow that data
completely through the workflow to the
[SPEAKER_00]: final certificate of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've looked at the entire regulatory
requirements which is typically four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five chemistry assays, one microbial assay
and then foreign matter and moisture and
[SPEAKER_00]: included those workflows in the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may or may not have instrument
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have instrumentation already,
you can work with the Perkinoma software
[SPEAKER_00]: to improve the data transfer across your
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the certificate of analysis and the
reports have been developed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: configurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we started with our best attempt
at looking at that specific state
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement, looking at the font size,
the colors that have to be used so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are gonna be in a good position to
submit your data for the state for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we're very excited about the
science in cannabis and hemp and helping
[SPEAKER_00]: labs across the globe get or produce
better quality data so that the right
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions could be made for these markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that looks like from our team is
having a dedicated cannabis team that
[SPEAKER_00]: starts at the very beginning on the
installation of any instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: We perform a specific cannabis suitability
test so we know that the matrix you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to test ultimately is the one that
is being validated by us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we train with a dedicated
cannabis application team and let you
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously go through the validation
process yourself, but then you're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: position to run client samples and
generate COAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like myself and the extended
team are always available to listen,
[SPEAKER_00]: understand challenges or opportunities
where we can always work together in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to learn more, please stop
by the booth or check us out on social
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are global.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very strong presence in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to introduce you to the local
Perkinomba representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those that like virtual reality,
we have a new VR demo lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very cool because you get to pick up
the cannabis, walk through the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: touch the technologies, learn about it and
interact with myself and the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to schedule that after this
meeting by reaching out to me on my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in summary, we're excited to have this
portfolio to support cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We strongly believe in automation,
whether it be hard technology or software
[SPEAKER_00]: to improve the data quality so that
regulators, medicinal discussions can be
[SPEAKER_00]: supported with the right data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, no matter where you are,
if you're in a legal market, we're there
[SPEAKER_00]: to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach me on the email shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to take one or two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I know, we're tight for time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be available at the booth after
this for about the next hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time.
