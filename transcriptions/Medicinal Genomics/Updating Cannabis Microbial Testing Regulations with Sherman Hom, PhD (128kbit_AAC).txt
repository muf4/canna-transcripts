[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_01]: puts on the CanMed conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are getting closer and closer to the
CanMed 23 Innovation and Investment Summit
[SPEAKER_01]: with each podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already in February, which means
CanMed 23 is a little over three months
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you are as excited as we are and I
hope to see you down in Marco Island this
[SPEAKER_01]: May.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are new to the podcast and you
aren't aware of CanMed 23, it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusive three-day event designed for
Candice industry thought leaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: CanMed provides an immersive forum where
cannabis researchers, physicians,
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, entrepreneurs, and investors can
collaborate and share their latest
[SPEAKER_01]: innovations and insights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day one kicks off with four intensive
professional development workshops,
[SPEAKER_01]: including a full-day medical practicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The following two days will feature 30
oral presenters curated by our advisory
[SPEAKER_01]: board covering the latest innovations in
cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this all takes place at the Marriott
and Marco Island Beach Resort,
[SPEAKER_01]: May 15th through 17th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out all the latest information at
canmedevents.com and request your
[SPEAKER_01]: invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're adding new information every day,
so be sure to sign up for email alerts so
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't miss out on any big
announcements.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dr. Sherman Holm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sherman is the director of regulatory
affairs at Medicinal Genomics,
[SPEAKER_01]: where he provides recommendations to
regulatory officials that are tasked with
[SPEAKER_01]: drafting or modifying microbial testing
regulations for cannabis, hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: and psychedelic mushrooms to ensure safe
products for patients and consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before Medicinal Genomics, Sherman worked
for the New Jersey Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: While there, he led teams that started the
Cannabis Testing Laboratory, the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbial Testing Unit, and he created the
All States Medical Cannabis Program
[SPEAKER_01]: Requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: At CanMed 23, Sherman will share the
latest updates to his compendium to
[SPEAKER_01]: elucidate the present microbial testing
landscape and identify a consensus set of
[SPEAKER_01]: tests to lower public health risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: During our conversation, we discussed how
concerned cannabis consumers should be
[SPEAKER_01]: about microbial contamination,
how microbial regulations differ from
[SPEAKER_01]: state to state or jurisdiction to
jurisdiction, how growers in certain
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions struggle to meet microbial
regulations, the difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: presence-absence tests and total count
microbial tests, and the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between plating and QPCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Sherman, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Labware.
[SPEAKER_01]: Labware is recognized as the global leader
in providing enterprise-scale laboratory
[SPEAKER_01]: automation solutions with over 40 offices

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sherman Hom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Sherman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be here, and I'd like to express
my appreciation for this opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: share my knowledge concerning various
cannabis regulatory issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and specifically, let's talk about
microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As some listeners may know, microbial
testing is a topic that's near and dear to
[SPEAKER_01]: our hearts here at Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our flagship product line, Pathoseq,
is used by many of the top cannabis labs
[SPEAKER_01]: to test products for microbial
contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: But although we're well versed in the
micro world, I know that not all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Sherman, I was hoping we could start
off with the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first and foremost, how concerned
should consumers be of microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination in cannabis products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in my mind, cannabis consumers
should be concerned about microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some consumers are patients with
illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these patients are
immunocompromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've done is I've collected over 25
clinical case studies from the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: literature of people becoming infected
with microbial pathogens affiliated with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is even one clinical case study of
an immunocompetent person using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that got valley fever, which is caused by
a fungus called cryptococcus, and this
[SPEAKER_00]: illness can be quite severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cases may be just the tip of the
iceberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So valley fever and cryptococcus,
I mean, I have to admit that's new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cryptococcus, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a bacteria, a fungus, and how are
labs testing for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are they, I guess is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cryptococcus is a fungus that's found in
the soil, initially found in the soils of
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States and the Southwest,
and it's spread in actually in wind
[SPEAKER_00]: storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cannabis cultivation sites that
either grow outdoors or even these fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: spores can get inside indoor grows through
the HVAC system and be in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this time, there are no states that
require testing for cryptococcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to talk later concerning the
expansion of the microbial testing rules
[SPEAKER_00]: of specific pathogens from now into the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now what is or what are the most
dangerous microbial pathogens that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: found in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most dangerous microbial pathogens
that are required for testing presently
[SPEAKER_00]: are the four aspergillus species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are specifically aspergillus flavus,
aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus niger,
[SPEAKER_00]: and aspergillus terius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another pathogen are bacteria,
and these are the salmonella species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practically all salmonella species are
pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the literature shows there are
only two that are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also include the Shiga
toxin-producing E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, the most pathogenic of the six
pathotypes due to as a check for sanitary
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes or detection of untreated
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sanitary practices in cultivation
sites or processing sites or product
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also continue to monitor the medical
literature for other pathogens that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been affiliated with cannabis use as
possible candidates in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to ask you a little bit
more about aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're saying you were reviewing
the clinical cases, how many of those
[SPEAKER_01]: involved aspergillus contamination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a vast majority, you know,
well over a couple of dozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are respiratory illnesses,
the prevalent one being aspergillosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can cause severe illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of the clinical case studies
indicated death unto the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be quite dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually found two epidemiological
studies that showed salmonella outbreaks
[SPEAKER_00]: affiliated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going back to aspergillus again,
sorry, but I think it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: clarify that, am I correct in my
understanding that the risk is really an
[SPEAKER_01]: inhaled product?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because aspergillus, these aspergillus
microorganisms produce these spores that
[SPEAKER_00]: are readily emitted into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one could be simply handling
cannabis flowers to make, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a joint, for example, can be
inhaling these spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I have a study, a research study
that shows that under certain conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: of vaporization, temperatures like a
volcano, for example, which is a device
[SPEAKER_00]: for inhaling cannabis flower, the spores
actually survive those temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hadn't, I hadn't thought of it,
I guess, until now that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus is really a concern for the
processors as well, or those who are
[SPEAKER_01]: working in a cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were handling, trimming any flower
that were contaminated, they could be
[SPEAKER_01]: breathing it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the workers who are diligently
supporting this industry may be patients
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves that have, you know,
there are immunocompromised people that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't consume cannabis that work in these
cannabis sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be another important thing
to point out as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The risk of developing aspergillus,
it's, is it only amongst immunocompromised
[SPEAKER_01]: people, or is it just much, much more
likely that it would develop in those
[SPEAKER_01]: folks?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be much more likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'd like to qualify I'm not
a clinician, but as far as I've read in
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature, the persons that are
immunocompromised are more likely to get
[SPEAKER_00]: this respiratory infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move on a little bit to the
regulatory landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you describe the regulatory landscape
when it comes to microbial testing on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to focus just on the
United States and to date, there are 37
[SPEAKER_00]: states, Washington DC, and one major U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these jurisdictions have adopted,
believe it or not, 41 sets of microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: testing rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 22 different required microbial
tests from all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten are what's called total count tests,
such as total aerobic bacteria or total
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast and molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 12 are specific pathogen tests,
in which earlier I named five of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we have 37 states,
Washington DC, and one territory and 41
[SPEAKER_01]: sets of microbial testing rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this cover both medical and adult
use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that why there's so many?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very astute, fast calculator person can
see that there actually are 39
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions, but one sets of microbial
testing rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because two states, Arizona and New
York, have separate microbial testing
[SPEAKER_00]: rules for the medical and the adult use
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to do the math quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think that was adding up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I would never ask you to speak for
the regulators, but why do you think that
[SPEAKER_01]: there is really apparently little to no
consensus when it comes to the regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: from state to state?
[SPEAKER_00]: The lack of consensus, I believe,
can be viewed from a more historical
[SPEAKER_00]: viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became the project manager to lead a
group of chemists to start the first
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis testing lab in the state of New
Jersey under the auspices of the New
[SPEAKER_00]: Jersey Department of Health, Public
Health, and Environmental Laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And subsequently, I was involved in this
Association of Public Health Laboratories,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Community of Practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were government official from
different departments, some who were
[SPEAKER_00]: tasked to draft the testing rules for
their cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were few subject matter experts
concerning testing rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard the pain in their voices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew as little as they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what occurred is what I... Well,
I feel that there's different factors that
[SPEAKER_00]: were involved in how this lack of
consensus occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the lack of subject matter experts
and cannabis testing rules being an
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the time pressure of implementation
of the cannabis program caused what I call
[SPEAKER_00]: cut and paste syndrome, whereby the
regulatory officials simply looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: another or a few other states' microbial
testing rules and simply picked theirs
[SPEAKER_00]: without sufficient scientific due
diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, just how wide... We've talked
about all the different sets of microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How widely do these regulations differ
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations differ widely in several
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One would be the number of required
microbial tests, where I have observed a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of one test to 10 tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, for each of the tests, each test
type, you might say, the action levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take the example of total yeast and
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The action level can vary up to 1,000-fold
difference between one state and another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, 100-fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also, the test combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a vast majority of the
microbial testing rules for plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst all the jurisdictions are unique.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to imagine if you were a
multi-state operator, if you were a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator operating in several different
states, that would be difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: standardize your procedures or anything to
be able to meet all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is a challenge, and one must have
an excellent chief compliance officer to
[SPEAKER_00]: examine the regulations for the microbial
testing regulations in each state,
[SPEAKER_00]: understand them very, very well,
note the differences, and recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: modifications to one standard operating
procedures, if needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cannot just do a cookie-cutter type
process and just carry it from state to
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they need to know the differences in
the state regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick plug for medicinalgenomics.com,
where we have a tool that Sherman was very
[SPEAKER_01]: instrumental in putting the information
together on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have an interactive tool on our
website that shows the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations for all the different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: If folks are interested in checking that
out, I'll put a link in the show
[SPEAKER_01]: description.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a great tool to really get a
sense for all these different regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: and what they mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've talked about how the
regulations are very varied from state to
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does microbial compare to other
compliance tests like pesticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals, and potency?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a similar problem there or is
microbial unique in that sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Off the top of my head, I can say that the
similarity or diversity of required tests
[SPEAKER_00]: for these other chemical classes depends
on which one we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the cannabinoids,
you've got the metals, and mycotoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: testing show similarity amongst the
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the cannabinoids, many states require
quantification of four, which is the THCA,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, CBDA, and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: For metals, many states require what
everyone calls the big four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arsenate, cadmium, lead, and mercury.
[SPEAKER_00]: For mycotoxins, most states require a
family of aflatoxins and a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: ocrotoxin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, in 2019, I counted over
500 unique pesticides that were required
[SPEAKER_00]: by at least one jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states had very short lists of
pesticides and other states had very long
[SPEAKER_00]: lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have is similarity as well as
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots to navigate with all of these tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going back to microbial specifically,
I think you had touched on this before
[SPEAKER_01]: when you were talking about the diversity
of the different regulations that are out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but I was hoping if you could
describe the difference between what we
[SPEAKER_01]: refer to as total count tests and specific
pathogen tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the obvious difference between a
total count test and a specific count
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen test is that the total count test
simply counts the number of cells per gram
[SPEAKER_00]: or per milliliter of cannabis sample,
while the specific pathogen test detects
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence or absence of the human
pathogen that can cause illness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these total count tests, there is an
allowable limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have X amount of this family,
whereas the pathogen is we don't want any
[SPEAKER_01]: of that in the product at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, what are sort of the pros and
cons, benefits and drawbacks of each of
[SPEAKER_01]: these types of tests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to start with the total count
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example is total yeast and molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I see is the primary drawback for a
total count test is that a result
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed as colony forming units that
exceeds the action level carries a
[SPEAKER_00]: financial consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The damaging result that the cultivator or
product processor or product manufacturer
[SPEAKER_00]: receives does not provide the submitting
organization any information that any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the yeast or molds counted in the sample
were human pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a jurisdiction is debt set on
keeping a total count test, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend that a second test be required
that looks for the presence of specific
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial or fungal pathogens that may
hurt or cause illness in human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on the other hand, for specific
pathogen tests, the primary benefit is
[SPEAKER_00]: that one detects a bacterium or a mold
that might cause a patient or a consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: to get sick or even die.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, the drawback or what's
missing is there are probably other
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens besides the 12 that are required
presently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why I constantly monitor the
medical literature for other candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens to possibly consider testing
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: An example of that could be one that we
brought up earlier, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cryptococcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you pointed out, the total count
tests aren't necessarily going to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: people from that because if your state's
allowing 10,000 CFUs of total yeast and
[SPEAKER_01]: mold and isn't looking specifically for
Cryptococcus, I mean, that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: included in that number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's below the threshold that's getting
out there, but potentially could be
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I entered the cannabis microbial
testing space as a traditional as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular microbiologist with five decades
of experience and observed these required
[SPEAKER_00]: total count tests, I asked regulatory
officials and other subject matter experts
[SPEAKER_00]: in the microbial testing world why these
total counts, what value these total count
[SPEAKER_00]: tests had or why were they adopted?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the primary answer I got was,
well, we're requiring this on the side of
[SPEAKER_00]: caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why I recommend if you exceed,
if you're dead set on keeping the total
[SPEAKER_00]: count tests, I feel that a second test
should be done seeking specific pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I understand from networking
with multi-state cultivators, millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars of cannabis is being diverted into
concentrate or destroyed due to laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: results that do not provide any real
information about the danger of the sample
[SPEAKER_00]: to human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think you touched on a great
point there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of the questions I had here
to ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I think you kind of answered it
here, but maybe to reiterate, these
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial testing regulations have a real
effect on growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So although it's nice that the regulators
are erring on the side of caution,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be a real financial toll or can
lead to this diversion to concentrate if
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulation are hard for the growers to
meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you could just kind of reiterate,
how do these microbial testing regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: affect growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, I'll try to summarize my answer
in a succinct manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with the total count tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always have an action level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a common 10,000 colony
forming units per gram of flour sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the number of colonies per gram exceeds
the action level, the consequence in many
[SPEAKER_00]: states is diversion to produce concentrate
with a retest of the total yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I understand it, that's a financial
loss because the value of flour versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: value of concentrate flour is more
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a grower, processor, or product
manufacturer, if I was such an owner,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have no information whether the
diverted batch of cannabis flour had any
[SPEAKER_00]: human pathogens that may cause illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, a grower that knows one
has the pathogens in the flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I was the owner, then I would want an
opportunity to divert the batch to make
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a retest instead of destruction,
which is required in some states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, at least get something out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of reasonable, are there certain
jurisdictions where growers have a really
[SPEAKER_01]: hard time meeting the requirements?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one state, and that is Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the only state where growers have an
almost impossible time getting underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: a particular action level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the action level for total yeast
and mold tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 1,000 colony forming units per gram,
which is 10 to 100 times lower than all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other states that require that
particular test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to elaborate a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have laboratory testing evidence that
perhaps many Illinois growers are using
[SPEAKER_00]: various remediation technologies to lower
the number of yeast and molds and other
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms before testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some remediation technologies degrade
the beneficial chemicals in the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: while other remediation technologies may
cause the formation of viable but not
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural microbes that will resuscitate
and multiply on dispensary shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was exemplified by last year's
Chicago Sun Times investigative report
[SPEAKER_00]: that a vast majority of the dispensary
bought pre-rolls had total yeast and mold
[SPEAKER_00]: levels above the action level,
but the certificate of analysis showed
[SPEAKER_00]: levels under the action levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one can make a parallel concerning the
dangerous aspergillus pathogen whereby a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower could perform a remediation method
on the cannabis flower, cause the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of viable but not culturable
dangerous pathogenic aspergillus species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would pass the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't be able to detect it,
let's say on a agar plate, and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: would grow on the dispensary shelf and
possibly cause harm to a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I think it's important to clarify,
too, that, you know, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of an allowable limit, which,
you know, again, for someone who's not in
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbial world, do the thing like,
well, why is there any?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is there any yeast and mold on my
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is is it feasible?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know the answer to this
question, but maybe we should kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: spell it out that, you know, it's not
possible to really have cannabis flower
[SPEAKER_01]: that is devoid of any microbial life just
because of the nature of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microorganisms are ubiquitous in all
environments, and there are beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's what I call benign ones that are
neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are those that are
pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a microbiologist, most of the
microorganisms on our earth are
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial, and there are a few pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did bring up another point,
and I'd be remiss if I didn't address
[SPEAKER_01]: this, but I was wondering if you could
speak a little bit about the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between microbial testing techniques,
specifically plating versus QPCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is a very hot topic and very
important topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have dialogue upon because the other
major regulatory issue when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis microbial testing is not only
what test is required or action level that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have, but also what rules that you
have and what I call allowable methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started examining microbial
testing rules for allowable methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: I noted that some states were very
one-sided, which is what is termed the
[SPEAKER_00]: gold standard or historical standard,
and that is the culture or agar plating
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were some states that
allowed both, which is more fair because
[SPEAKER_00]: one has to know the advantages and
disadvantages of these two primary
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have performed over decades both
types of technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sincerely feel that there are
multiple drawbacks concerning plating
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first that comes to my mind is
that not all microorganisms, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to pick one growth medium for
your counting or enumerating a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms and not, there is no one
medium that will count all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generically, close to 95% of the
microorganisms on the earth do not form a
[SPEAKER_00]: colony on a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're missing a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another feature of the cannabis matrix are
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very unique matrix because the
cannabinoids have antibiotic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that will alter your results
because many bacterial species and fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: species, they are sensitive to
antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also both bacteria as well as fungal
species have been found to be what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of their life cycle is inside the
plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any method that tries to isolate those
microorganisms within the plant tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: will destroy all the microbial cells and
really alter ones or many of the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: cells which will alter your test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the culture or plating methods
are done at a single temperature and some
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, microbial pathogens grow at
lower temperatures than the usual 35 to 37
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, the quantitative
polymerase chain reaction test for
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial detection avoids all these
drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also known in many industries
especially the clinical diagnostic
[SPEAKER_00]: industry to be the most sensitive,
the most specific, also to have the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: limit of detection and the fastest
turnaround time which is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the four advantages I see
with quantitative PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, everyone is just waiting me
to finish my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happened to me just yesterday where
there was a microbiologist that said to
[SPEAKER_00]: me, well, there is one big problem with
QPCR tests and that is one might detect
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic material from dead pathogenic
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore, a positive which would
cause a consequence is a false positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to simply share with everyone
that multiple test developers have
[SPEAKER_00]: developed methods to eliminate the DNA
from dead cells before the detection of
[SPEAKER_00]: the DNA from live cells which is quite an
advancement for the diagnostic testing
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And medicinal genomics is one of those
developers, Grim Reaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of our products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check it out on medicinalgenomics
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Sherman, we're winding down
here but before I let you go, one more
[SPEAKER_01]: question that I wanted to ask you because
we did call out Illinois for their overly
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictive regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was curious, in your opinion,
what jurisdictions have done a good job
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating cannabis microbial testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are four states I'd like to
give a shout out to and that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: California, Oregon, Montana, and Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are examples where these
jurisdictions follow what I believe is the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate or the correct approach at
this time and that is requiring for the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing of specific pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'd like to give a shout out to the
states such as Oregon, Vermont,
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana, and Connecticut that for
allowable methods require the AOAC
[SPEAKER_00]: performance test methods that follow the
guidelines of the standard method
[SPEAKER_00]: performance requirements that AOAC issued
for the test developers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Sherman, thanks again for
joining me on the podcast.
