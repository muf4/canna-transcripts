[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I was curious, how are people
using cannabis kind of to treat their
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sort of like a preventative thing or
like a kind of daily usage just to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: keep symptoms at bay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do they actually use it in an acute
situation where, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a panic attack or having an episode
ingesting cannabis to kind of get back to
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, for the research study,
we just started collecting patients in
[SPEAKER_01]: October.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still in the data collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't even have any data yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still in the patient recruitment
part of that study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we get all the patients and
we sort of close off, which I think we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing January 1st, then we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have that like six months is the
survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my practice, so I am independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work as a consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a registered nurse and I coach people
and work with people alongside of their
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor as a bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite thing to say about nursing and
cannabis is, well, holistic and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine overall is we are the bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the bridge between the provider and
the dispensary for the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the bridge between like traditional
medicine and then holistic and integrative
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm writing a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nurses are the bridge coming soon,
hopefully by Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as that nurse coach, nurse educator in
my practice with patients, I have many
[SPEAKER_01]: people that have suffered from like sexual
trauma, domestic violence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of them are women and many of
them have like an overwhelming sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: doom every day and that there really
aren't a good group of or a good protocol
[SPEAKER_01]: for prescription medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a plant medicine nurse, but I'm very
much also for integrating traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't have a lot of traditional
pharmaceuticals that work or that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to take so many or the side effects are so
much that that can relieve the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have people getting back to your
question that take a low dose of just
[SPEAKER_01]: something routinely, which we have some
pretty good data and some of our friends
[SPEAKER_01]: that are very involved with CanMed and
medicinal genomics would share that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one-to-one equal amounts of CBD
and THC have been known in low doses to be
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do have some people that utilize
those types of routes of administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting more data, more research
recently about another cannabinoid CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: being really helpful also for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to your point, depending on when their
symptoms are worse generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's not that they just wake up
every day with that impending doom and
[SPEAKER_01]: need something, if it is more about being
in the world and being triggered,
[SPEAKER_01]: like potentially somebody that was in a
traumatic car accident might have anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: just every time they have to get in the
car and drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to encourage people to
smoke a little bit before they get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: car and drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be thoughtful, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that case, we definitely would be
considering a less intoxicating route,
[SPEAKER_01]: less cannabinoid and less intoxicating
route.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want people to be safe on the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it is that they're going to be home
or they're in an environment where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not the driver, then potentially if they
are triggered, having an inhalation option
[SPEAKER_01]: available, whether that is in inhaling,
like a lot of times, honestly,
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell people with post-traumatic stress
disorder and like panic attacks related to
[SPEAKER_01]: it to consider carrying a vape pen like
it's an EpiPen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have it on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to, again, in a legal state
where you legally can use it, have it
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just knowing you have it might help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not even need to use it,
but it's easier and more accessible than
[SPEAKER_01]: having to actually light something and
smoke it in environments where with the
[SPEAKER_01]: state of our country, we still not be able
to do that everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have had experience with multiple
patients where just having it in their
[SPEAKER_01]: purse, on their person, just knowing they
have it has been enough for their brain to
[SPEAKER_01]: release the sympathetic nervous system,
get back to a more natural response and
[SPEAKER_01]: feel better and or they can take a puff or
two and immediately have some relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it can be used and I'm
interested to see the survey responses
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think it can be used in the
moment, but we would be looking,
[SPEAKER_01]: my goal for most people is hopefully to
prevent having to even get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having to prevent those feelings because
when our body is releasing all that
[SPEAKER_01]: cortisol and going through that triggered
response, it's unhealthy for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, on panic attacks, it doesn't feel
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would prefer it if we could just keep
the edge off that and utilize the tools of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis medicine, plant medicine,
and maybe entheogenic medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: some psychedelics to do the work,
do the therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Retrain our brain to learn a new response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining us.
