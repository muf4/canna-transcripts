[SPEAKER_01]: On this episode, we welcome Dr. Peter
Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Grinspoon is a primary care physician
at Massachusetts General Hospital and an
[SPEAKER_01]: instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical
School.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a contributing editor to Harvard
Health Publications and the Harvard Health
[SPEAKER_01]: Blog, where he frequently writes about
cannabis medicine issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Grinspoon also writes about addiction,
from both the perspective of a clinician
[SPEAKER_01]: treating the disorder and as someone who
is in recovery from opioid addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spoke a lot about how cannabis can be
used to treat addiction in our
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation, as well as why Dr. Grinspoon
believes all primary care providers should
[SPEAKER_01]: be knowledgeable about medical cannabis,
how medical cannabis offers a safer
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative to medications used to treat
chronic pain and insomnia, how years of
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-cannabis propaganda has tainted the
medical cannabis conversation,
[SPEAKER_01]: why both sides of the cannabis issue need
to behave better when discussing the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits and risks, the five ways cannabis
can help with the opioid crisis,
[SPEAKER_01]: how prescription drug usage tends to drop
in legal cannabis states, whether cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: itself is addictive, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Peter, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Mace Media Group, who is hosting
the original CBD Expo Midwest 2021,

[SPEAKER_01]: Peter Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to talk with you today about
how you incorporate cannabis into your
[SPEAKER_01]: primary care practice, particularly when
it comes to treating addiction,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know you have a lot of
experience there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe a good place to start is to have
you describe the types of patients and
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions you treat, and then we can get
more specifically into cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I incorporate cannabis in my primary care
practice, and then I have a private
[SPEAKER_00]: practice that I, on the side where I do
consultations and certifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be great if all primary
care doctors is certified and advise
[SPEAKER_00]: people on medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of my vision for the future
where all doctors are conversant and
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable discussing cannabis with
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all know about the endocannabinoid
system, and they all can give their
[SPEAKER_00]: patients good and helpful advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we're not quite there yet
because of the 80 years of drug war
[SPEAKER_00]: mentality and the fact that the
endocannabinoid system hasn't been really
[SPEAKER_00]: taught much at all in medical schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: The irony is that medical cannabis makes
my life as a primary care doctor much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier because it offers me tools that I
wouldn't otherwise have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the most difficult things to treat
as a primary care doctor are chronic pain
[SPEAKER_00]: and insomnia, and the alternatives for
these are often much more dangerous than
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say two of the most common things
I treat in my primary care clinic are
[SPEAKER_00]: insomnia and chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: For insomnia, I'd be using Ambien or
sedative or amitriptyline, some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: tricyclic, and those can affect your
memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make you groggy, and you compare that
with maybe a drop or two of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture, and the person has a slight
euphoria and gently falls to sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not groggy the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's sort of a nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a no-brainer to try cannabis,
and it's much less habit-forming,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, than the benzodiazepines like
Valium or Klonopin, and then for chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, what are your options?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to be on opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tylenol doesn't do anything, and then the
non-steroidals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see so many patients with their kidneys
dying in their 50s, 60s, and 70s,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they haven't died of a heart attack or
an ulcer first, just from using chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: Aleve, Naperson, Ibuprofen, Advil,
cannabis can be a much safer and healthier
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative as Americans get bigger,
portlier, and more arthritic in their
[SPEAKER_00]: knees and hips and backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chronic pain and insomnia are two
examples of things that not only do I
[SPEAKER_00]: treat frequently in my primary care
practice with cannabis, but I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis would help primary care doctors
across the board if they incorporated it
[SPEAKER_00]: as a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make their lives a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, agreed, and I think we all share
your vision or your goal of educating
[SPEAKER_01]: primary care physicians and helping them
understand the benefits of using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that trend starting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see more primary care physicians or
even physicians in general opening up to
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea of using cannabis and learning
more about the endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, among younger doctors,
they're very and doctors in training are
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of outraged that it's not being
taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are very much more educated about
the war on drugs and the social history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the younger doctors are like,
I can't believe you guys aren't teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system is sort of the
control system for all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotransmitter systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you leave this out of the
medical school curriculum?
[SPEAKER_00]: But also in general, doctors are becoming
so much more accepting of cannabis as the
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback from patients of positive
clinical outcomes reaches them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that doctors are taking the
lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: With few exceptions, doctors have sort of
been on the wrong side of the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to their credit, doctors are following
the patients, but they're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think generally doctors are getting
on board, but doctors generally have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty big task in terms of not only
learning how to incorporate medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis into their practice, but they
have to sort of unlearn some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nonsense that they've been taught about
cannabis along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about having to unlearn
stigma, unlearn nonsense, and then learn a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole new treatment modality, it is a
pretty tall order.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's doable and doctors have an
obligation to do it because they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it wrong thus far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really critical way to help
patients navigate a whole host of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is going to take some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you mentioned was
following the patients and that oftentimes
[SPEAKER_01]: patients will come to their doctors
interested in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find that a lot in your practice or
are you suggesting it to your patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a little bit self-selecting
because once you get known as a physician
[SPEAKER_00]: that's sort of interested and advocates
for cannabis, people do sort of seek you
[SPEAKER_00]: out for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my colleagues refer patients to
me for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the one hand, quite a few patients
come to me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, just for my routine
primary care patients that really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know anything about me aside from the fact
that I'm their doctor, I will definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A perfect example of a patient that I
might bring it up to is the patient with
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate chronic pain whose kidney
function is starting to go after being on
[SPEAKER_00]: non-steroidals.
[SPEAKER_00]: For several decades, this might be a
patient that I've adopted, inherited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctors retire, they leave, you inherit a
patient from someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it had been my patient all along,
it wouldn't have been on non-steroidals
[SPEAKER_00]: all along and their kidneys wouldn't have
been dying in the first place because I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have had them on medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I adopt a patient whose kidneys are
slowly dying because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-steroidals, that will be someone that
I will say, hey, you can control your
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic pain with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could use low doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably won't have very much of the
high at all if you don't want to because
[SPEAKER_00]: we could use CBD or we could use low
dosage or we could use topicals and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could experiment with different
modalities, different doses, different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, and we could really make a go at
protecting your kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people are open to trying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're elderly, if they're
conservative, they might have too much
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma still internalized from the 80
years of drug war propaganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more and more people are open to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are very enthusiastic about it
and more and more people are open to
[SPEAKER_00]: trying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you try it, it's not a
success for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people, it doesn't help their
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people, they have side effects
like anxiety or they just don't like how
[SPEAKER_00]: it feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say for most people,
it helps them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we're talking about using
cannabis to treat chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another drug that's commonly used to
treat chronic pain is opioids,
[SPEAKER_01]: which kind of brings us to this whole idea
of addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can cannabis be used to treat
opioid addiction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I view it as there are five ways in
which cannabis can help with the opioid
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis, four of which I support and one of
which I don't support yet because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis can be used instead of opiates to
treat chronic pain for new patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you fewer patients that are on opiates
that could potentially get addicted to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take patients that are on
opiates because we over prescribed opiates
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a ton of people on opiates
that don't need to be opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could offer to transition them from
opiates to cannabis and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: get them off of opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this has to be done voluntarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe in forcing anybody off
opiates if they're on opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third way is if you add cannabis to
opiates, the dose of opiates can often be
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 percent of what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could lower the dose by 80 percent
because cannabis and opiates work on very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and a lot of the mischief you get in
with opiates in terms of addiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: dependence, overdose is dose related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get someone from like 100
milligrams to 20 milligrams of morphine
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent, that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fourth way is that cannabis can be
really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some studies that show this
and I can tell you this from personal
[SPEAKER_00]: experience because I'm in recovery from
opiate addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is probably the most effective
medication for opiate withdrawal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're getting off opiates or
transitioning onto buprenorphine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, suboxone, cannabis can be really
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are four ways in which cannabis
is extremely helpful in getting people off
[SPEAKER_00]: their opiates for chronic pain,
cutting down their dose for chronic pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: or helping them transition off street
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fifth way, which I can't quite
recommend yet, is can we use cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: drug like buprenorphine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Suboxone or methadone as a replacement for
opiates in terms of medication assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know of thousands of patients that
have vouched that they've used cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: get off opiates and have used cannabis as
a replacement for heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I truly believe that in the future,
this may be the case that you're not just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have buprenorphine, methadone,
you're going to have buprenorphine,
[SPEAKER_00]: methadone and cannabis to get people off
of opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at the moment, the data is that
buprenorphine and methadone have been
[SPEAKER_00]: shown to reduce overdoses and death by 50
to 80 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't shown that yet with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel uncomfortable recommending
cannabis for this because it just hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been shown yet to reduce overdose and
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, say you're my patient and you have a
migraine and I treat you with medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst case scenario is you get a
migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I treat you for opiate addiction
and it doesn't work, you overdose and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can die.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for that particular indication,
you have to stick with the data just
[SPEAKER_00]: because the consequences of overdosing are
so dire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It desperately needs to be studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, again, in the future,
we probably will be using cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: medication assisted treatment for opiate
use disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for right now, I stick with
buprenorphine and methadone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do prescribe buprenorphine to my
patients that are addicted to opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not allowed to prescribe methadone
in clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are for chronic pain, but not for
addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really an old fashioned law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is sort of the course of treatment
if, you know, I'm addicted to opioids and
[SPEAKER_01]: I come with you, I come to you sort of
what's your what's your plan of action?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have a great team at MGH.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a fantastic team and we do just an
unbelievable job with opiate addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a recovery coach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an addiction psychiatrist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a social worker that links
everybody together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the primary care doctors,
all of them prescribe suboxone or
[SPEAKER_00]: buprenorphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're sick, we have a great addiction
consult team in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a bridge clinic that bridges
people from the inpatient to the
[SPEAKER_00]: outpatient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one gets lost in the cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single one of our ER doctors is
certified to prescribe suboxone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter where you come in my
hospital, you get hooked up with suboxone
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get hooked up with a primary care
doctor to follow up with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get hooked up with a recovery
coach, someone who's not going to judge
[SPEAKER_00]: you, who's in recovery, who's going to
connect with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a complicated case, you get
hooked up with a addiction psychiatrist
[SPEAKER_00]: who could also help with the, you know,
people who are addicted also very
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently have untreated anxiety and
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone who could help disentangle that
or childhood trauma help you with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very coherent and
comprehensive addiction team in my
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can add is I can add medical
cannabis to patients, which in some
[SPEAKER_00]: studies has been shown to increase
retention in buprenorphine programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it certainly can help with the chronic
pain, the anxiety and the insomnia as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not technically an official quote
unquote part of our addiction team because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addiction physicians are, there's a
continuum among how accepting doctors are
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And addiction physicians and psychiatrists
in general tend to be less accepting than
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas oncologists, for example,
tend to be extremely accepting because the
[SPEAKER_00]: oncologists see that all their patients
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very complicated and a whole nother
discussion why addiction psychiatrists are
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could come up with a very cynical
explanation or you could come up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: less cynical explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they tend to be a little bit less
supportive of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the team that I work with,
the teams that I work with at MGH are very
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just had a lot of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like cannabis is sort of a
supplemental drug in this whole program
[SPEAKER_01]: that you guys have put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's supplemental.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are accepting of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I would have to say that in my
hospital, just like everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: it depends who you talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you talk to certain doctors,
cannabis is a helpful wellness tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you talk to other doctors,
it's like the devil's lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a split just like you have
everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking to me and I'm a
supporter of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other doctors in my hospital
that you could talk to that would
[SPEAKER_00]: completely disagree with what I just said
over the last five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like all doctors have this
monolithic acceptance of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wide variety of opinions,
some of which is very negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have a long way to go towards
universal acceptance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we break through there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just we need more data?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more clinical trials?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acceptance is heading in the right
direction across the board with patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: with doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: With nurses, with health care
professionals across all age groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we legalize, the sky doesn't fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: As people get more clinical experience
with it, it gets less stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_00]: As people see relatives that benefit from
medical cannabis and they use it and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't become a motivational and
irresponsible and they don't just sit in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sofa and eat Doritos all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually go on with their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually, you know, their lives can
actually be enhanced if they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering from insomnia and chronic pain,
they actually can be more active and more
[SPEAKER_00]: engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think with time, this is just getting
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also need people to like counter
the propaganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot of propaganda out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just yesterday, there was a very
disappointing piece in the New York Times
[SPEAKER_00]: that was based on a very disappointing
book that was sort of dressed up to look
[SPEAKER_00]: like a medical textbook, which I've
actually been reading and tweeting and
[SPEAKER_00]: making fun of for the last three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just causes self an evidence based
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's dressed up for doctors and
it looks like a textbook, but it just
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry picks all the evidence that's
against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it is an evidence based approach,
but it's not really a balanced evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: based approach if you just take all the
evidence against cannabis and put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: book and ignore all the evidence in favor
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really do need people to be
vigilant, to look at the studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the studies about cannabis are
really helpful and really valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people that are pro-cannabis need to
accept the valid studies that show
[SPEAKER_00]: negative things about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like people who are anti-cannabis
need to accept the valid studies that show
[SPEAKER_00]: things about the medical benefits of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both sides need to behave better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the studies are still these
propaganda attack studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just trying to show harm just
as part of like a social statement,
[SPEAKER_00]: not as part of advancing our science base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just need neutral, skeptical people
to look at the studies to contextualize
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're helpful to say, this is
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we shouldn't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making this up during pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other people to look at the studies
and say, all right, look, teen use hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: gone up 50 times in Colorado since they
legalized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is BS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to really evaluate the
literature objectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to educate people, accept the
harms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to, I think, not have
self-inflicted injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's no reason to make cannabis
into gummy bears that pets and little kids
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a self-inflicted injury and is
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If cannabis is medicine, make it look and
taste like medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people got upset when I
wrote a blog about this, but I really
[SPEAKER_00]: firmly believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think with time and with people
being responsible and with good
[SPEAKER_00]: information out there, this is all going
to fall into place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a great point to say
that we do need to be accepting of the
[SPEAKER_01]: harms of cannabis because they do exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay, as long as we know what
they are and can act responsibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, especially being in this
industry, people get kind of wrapped up
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of presented as this panacea and
with no downsides.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's particularly difficult because
the government spent 80 years only funding
[SPEAKER_00]: studies about harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the studies were just BS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give a monkey like 80,000 times the amount
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember exaggerating a little bit that
a human would take and then the monkey's
[SPEAKER_00]: unconscious for four days and they'll be
like, cannabis makes you unconscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just do these ridiculous studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people don't trust the anti-cannabis
literature because it really was abused by
[SPEAKER_00]: the government and it was misused or
parroted sort of unreflectively by the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of distrust and I think
the medical establishment and the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific establishment needs to regain
the trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great if they acknowledged
their role in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would really help to regain
trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is that none of the
pro-cannabis people trust with good reason
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the anti-cannabis studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that leads to another problem is that
some of these studies that are coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: are really good and you can't just ignore
these good studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand the distrust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a complicated situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that you mentioned
before is that when cannabis is legalized
[SPEAKER_01]: in these states that the sky doesn't fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that does fall and
that I know you've written about before is
[SPEAKER_01]: opioid prescriptions and opioid overdoses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there definitely is something going on
there with cannabis and opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in Colorado, Medicare D
prescriptions across the board fell,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just for opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people were just taking a
puff instead of waiting to see their
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor and getting a muscle relaxant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of trying to get a prescription
for Viagra, they take a puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of getting an opiate, they just
take a puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people were self-medicating with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of trying to get an ambient
prescription from their doctor or
[SPEAKER_00]: benzodiazepine, they take a puff off their
vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people were self-treating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they were realizing that
cannabis does so many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the endocannabinoid system is involved
in so many different aspects of our body
[SPEAKER_00]: that it really does have a lot of
different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know how to use it,
you can treat many things that these
[SPEAKER_00]: different pharmaceutical agents that do
one thing can treat, which is why I think
[SPEAKER_00]: initially, at least, the pharmaceutical
companies donated so much money to the
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-side of the cannabis referendums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with opiates, one study showed that
the opiate overdoses dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then another study reevaluated it
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's questionable whether the opiate
overdoses dropped yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that they will be dropping
because so many people are using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it might be just too early to show
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, the opiate prescriptions
are dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been shown in so many studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it follows that if people are using
cannabis instead of opiates, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine that the opiate overdoses won't be
dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, at least three states
have these exchange programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could exchange your opiates for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, it's hard to overdose an
opiates if you're using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like apples and oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I honestly think it's going to be
extremely valuable in helping us work
[SPEAKER_00]: through the opiate overdoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the opiate crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the opiate crisis has gotten
much worse in the very short term because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the COVID pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of all bets are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be impossible to sort of
evaluate what's contributed to what last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, this year, and probably the next
year, because everything's out of whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really compare this year to
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the overdoses are up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be really hard to sort of
analyze what happened to what and what
[SPEAKER_00]: role cannabis played.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that you mentioned
too was it's not just opioids that people
[SPEAKER_01]: are substituting with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's other medications as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoid system is involved in
so many different body systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like, why not try cannabis
responsibly and see if it helps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these days, it's such a pain to like
see your doctor and go to the pharmacy and
[SPEAKER_00]: get a prescription and pay a co-payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these drugs have side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Ambien, people drive on Ambien and
don't remember they were driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like 10% of traffic accidents
have Ambien in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they wake up and they're like,
who ate all the food in the refrigerator
[SPEAKER_00]: and left all the wrappers in the table?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out it was like them and they
don't remember it because they were on
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambien and they were in this weird
dissociative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ambien might even affect your dementia
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to argue the cannabis for an
adult is not a thousand times safer than
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambien, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is it more convenient in the
legal state, but it's probably a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the opponents of cannabis go on
and on and on about the harms and the
[SPEAKER_00]: risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are harms and risks,
unquestionably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got to compare it to what else
we'd be using You can't just talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the harms and the risks in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to talk about the relative
harms and risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And melatonin is good for sleep and that
seems pretty risk free, but melatonin
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't work for that many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once you move beyond melatonin to
the Ambien's, the tricyclics, which can
[SPEAKER_00]: give you arrhythmias, the benzodiazepines
like Valium, which are so addictive,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Ambien, which we just talked about,
it's really hard to make an argument that
[SPEAKER_00]: those are safer than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked a lot about using cannabis
for opioid addiction, but can it be used
[SPEAKER_01]: for other addictions as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think CBD is going to have a huge
role in addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is preclinical research and some
clinical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD can help with cravings,
Q-induced cravings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They studied it in animals for cocaine
addiction, for methamphetamine addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some preliminary research
actually for cannabis addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's been human studies for
tobacco addiction and some for opioid
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD really shows a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of studying that we still
have to do, but CBD preliminarily seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like it has a lot of potential to help
people with the cravings and the
[SPEAKER_00]: rumination and the urges to continue using
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think CBD is going to have a huge
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for cannabis in general,
I think for withdrawal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for many drugs, when you withdraw,
you have anxiety, you have insomnia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have this general feeling of
ill-ease and discomfort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think cannabis is going to prove to
be very helpful for the withdrawal
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with opiates, it co-works on some of
the same receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's particularly helpful for
opiate withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in general, you're withdrawing
from nicotine, you feel grumpy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel irritable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis can be very helpful for that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think cannabis is going to be
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think on a kind of neurochemical
level, CBD is going to target the
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction very specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm understanding correctly,
it's almost like cannabis is used more to
[SPEAKER_01]: quell the unpleasant trees of withdrawals
and less as sort of a replacement for the
[SPEAKER_01]: drug itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with opiates, it might turn out to be
enough of a replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so many people say that it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just hasn't been shown yet officially
to reduce overdoses and deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't feel comfortable using it in
that manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it's something that serious,
you have to go with the evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we understand sort of which
cannabinoids or compounds within cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: are really kind of doing the heavy lifting
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it THC, CBD, a combination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you mean for the opiate replacement?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think certainly THC is a big part
of it because
[SPEAKER_00]: the short answer is we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medium answer is that THC plays a role
and CBD plays a role because of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different receptors that they hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some overlap with the opiate
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD is really complicated in how it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of theories about how
it can potentially help with addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not quite sure how it works
yet because CBD affects like a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think they're quite sure how
it affects addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not quite sure how to explain how CBD
would in particular affect addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read a bunch of articles on it,
but it's very complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so winding down here, we talked
earlier about sort of acknowledging some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the downsides of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to ask you, is cannabis
addiction a real thing or at least
[SPEAKER_01]: dependence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can get very dependent on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can overuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can have a hard time getting off
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be very difficult once a person
has been using cannabis for a long time to
[SPEAKER_00]: know whether cannabis is helping them
sleep or whether not using cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping them awake because if they don't
use it, they can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be a fine line between cannabis
is treating their insomnia or not using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is causing their insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a very fine line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get physical dependence and you
could definitely have withdrawal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they could be they're not
anything like opiate withdrawal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're not like feeling like you're
going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as I like to say, no one robs
pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's like breaking into dispensaries
because they're that sick from a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, people do not try to
stigmatize any addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, people get so sick with
opiate withdrawal, they do the craziest
[SPEAKER_00]: things to get drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you know,
if you use cannabis every day,
[SPEAKER_00]: your receptors down regulate because
you're always bombarding them with
[SPEAKER_00]: external cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're fewer and farther between.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then if you stop using it, your natural
endocannabinoids have many fewer receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have a relative endocannabinoid
deficiency and you have withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have grumpiness, insomnia,
lack of appetite, irritability,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably pain sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people do have withdrawal and they do
have tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, people, you know, use more as
they go along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can definitely get dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I view addiction is continued
use despite negative consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know people that should stop
smoking for one reason or another and just
[SPEAKER_00]: can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they have a drug test coming up for
work, but they can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I have a patient who I'm pretty sure
has cannabis hyperemesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ends up in the emergency room every
month barfing and having to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, can you let's just stop
smoking for three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you still end up in the emergency room
every night, then it's cyclic vomiting
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stop vomiting and don't end up in
the emergency room, then by definition,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's cannabis hyperemesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes away if you stop the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's literally the only way to
distinguish between cyclic vomiting
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome and cannabis hyperemesis is to
take the cannabis away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my patient's having a really hard time
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would call that continued use
despite negative consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call that an addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I certainly would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned cannabis hyper emesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the correct pronunciation there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Emesis is barfing and hyper emesis means
barfing a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how doctors use Latin words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I first became aware of that
condition at the last CanMed event where
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually had a panel about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a condition not a lot of
people know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you wanted to speak a bit
more to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was under diagnosed because when
cannabis was illegal, no one would mention
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're using cannabis because they
didn't want to have their kids taken away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's over diagnosed because it's like
a trendy diagnosis that all the emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: room doctors are making any time that
people come in vomiting and cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere on their list or they mentioned
cannabis using.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, it's a fairly rare but
real and significant condition where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that cannabis suppresses nausea,
for example, with chemotherapy patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you use a lot of it over a long
period of time, and this is the theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can over stimulate the receptor,
probably the TRPV receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a paradoxical reaction
and it causes uncontrolled vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not responsive to your traditional
medications for vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically, it's sometimes responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's responsive to like a hot shot of
water or a hot bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Haldol, that anti-psychotic that is
just awful, can make it go away as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very hard to distinguish from
something called cyclic vomiting syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just vomiting for no reason every
once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to distinguish it,
again, is to take away the cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: like a couple months and see if the
vomiting goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually a really good test to
see if someone's dependent on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they could stop or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if your doctor, who, for example,
is a very pro-cannabis doctor,
[SPEAKER_00]: says you have to stop for three months,
there's no stigma, there's no shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just, we want to see if your
vomiting is because of cannabis and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be an example of someone who
has a real problem with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we had a few people on the
panel who had actually experienced the
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms and described them on that panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, if stopping cannabis couldn't
prevent some of the things that were
[SPEAKER_01]: described, then I would definitely call
that an addiction because it sounded
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty awful to go through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I've seen it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person was barfing like for hours
uncontrollably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like there was nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried Compazine, I tried Odancetron,
literally nothing worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for hours, like they were so
miserable.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's not really where I'd
like to end the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you did mention that you want to
talk about a few of the harms to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every medicine I prescribe has
potential harms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's no medication that I
prescribe as a primary care doctor that
[SPEAKER_00]: might not have a bad reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, thank you for saving
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for doing that.
