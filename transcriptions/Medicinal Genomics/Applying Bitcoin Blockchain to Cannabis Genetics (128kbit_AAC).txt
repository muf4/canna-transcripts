[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everybody today we're going to be
talking about blockchains and how these
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to transform the cannabis
industry and why we're using them with our
[SPEAKER_00]: strain seek product offering blockchains
present tremendous amount of opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to the field and in order for you to
really I think understand blockchains you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to suspend some of your identity
politics you have to put all that aside
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask yourself you know largely identity
politics is arguing over what a
[SPEAKER_00]: centralized piece of power should do and
with blockchains you have to stop and ask
[SPEAKER_00]: do you need it anymore do you need a
centralized a command and control center
[SPEAKER_00]: governing this part of the economy or can
it be made obsolete just like monarchs
[SPEAKER_00]: were made obsolete hundreds of years ago
so suspend all of your prior thinkings on
[SPEAKER_00]: socioeconomics if you can for just a brief
moment and try to understand the magnitude
[SPEAKER_00]: and the gravity of what this technology
can do for people and it'll be much easier
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to I think to understand and
grapple with what's going on here so what
[SPEAKER_00]: is Bitcoin well I view things through a
biological lens and I view Bitcoin as
[SPEAKER_00]: basically an internet immune response it's
an immune response to something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved over the growth of the internet
the growth of the internet has over time
[SPEAKER_00]: created very large centralized power
brokers in the internet that control
[SPEAKER_00]: information and nothing's more true about
that when it comes to the actual banking
[SPEAKER_00]: system we have large centralized databases
now that are dangerous by design okay they
[SPEAKER_00]: are what we call honey pots for hackers
because they collect large amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: personal identification information credit
card information zip codes and social
[SPEAKER_00]: security numbers all of these things which
contribute to over 40 billion dollars in
[SPEAKER_00]: credit card theft every year and of course
digital identity theft is happening at
[SPEAKER_00]: record paces and creates a tremendous
amount of distraction and waste in the
[SPEAKER_00]: economy much of this is because there are
economic incentives to centralize this
[SPEAKER_00]: information and Bitcoin is changing that
it's creating an economic incentive to
[SPEAKER_00]: decentralize information and by doing so a
currency has emerged out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting technology okay so this honey
pot problem is critical to resolve in
[SPEAKER_00]: order for us to move money around the
internet if we cannot be certain of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trust of where data stays or stored we can
never be trusting a global internet ledger
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say all right so Bitcoin solves this
problem by making a global ledger but but
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a competition for people to keep
it alive and accurate all throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: globe the other the other key thing that
does is it solves something that's known
[SPEAKER_00]: as a digital or a double spend problem
just like with internet music it's easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: copy internet music over and over again
well how are we gonna make digital money
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's easy to copy it if it can be
copied over and over again it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to attack like the Federal Reserve
which has been printing boatloads of money
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last five years and that only
leads to hyperinflation and very dangerous
[SPEAKER_00]: economic circumstances and fundamentally
robs the middle class and makes people
[SPEAKER_00]: poor and enriches folks that are really
close to the printing press okay so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't have that in order to have a good
currency you need to have a regulated or
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated by code issuance if you will and
that's what Bitcoin is built into the
[SPEAKER_00]: program it's going to emit over 21 million
bitcoins as rewards for people who mined
[SPEAKER_00]: them all right we're already at 16 million
of these bitcoins which is why the price
[SPEAKER_00]: is going up exponentially because there is
reaching a scarcity part of the the
[SPEAKER_00]: printing process but the printing process
won't complete itself until 2140 okay and
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point there will be transaction
fees that will keep miners incentivized to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep mining this so what are miners you
have to understand why do miners mine and
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason miners mine is because Bitcoin
is a competition for computers to solve
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that and those and the proof of
those problems weave a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cryptographic safety into the ledger if
you will we'll touch on that momentarily
[SPEAKER_00]: but you also have to step back a little
bit more globally and realize what this
[SPEAKER_00]: has become ever since 2009 has been the
best performing currency globally for ever
[SPEAKER_00]: since its existence and it's now the
largest computer network in the world it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand times larger than the top 500
supercomputers combined and that number is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably old it seems to be keep going up
every year in terms of the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: computers that are turning to this you'll
see the network is measured in petahashes
[SPEAKER_00]: and hexahashes and more and more the
computers are turning their attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: solving this problem because there are
very interesting economic circumstances to
[SPEAKER_00]: be had from this what you will find in
this map are some interesting nodes in
[SPEAKER_00]: Iceland and in China and these are places
where energy is cheap because energy is
[SPEAKER_00]: really the core ingredient behind Bitcoin
mining and this is what drives most the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost so this has created a very
interesting symbiotic relationship that
[SPEAKER_00]: people have to keep their eye on that
power plants that oftentimes would have to
[SPEAKER_00]: over produce energy to match demand cycles
because you can't actually predict the
[SPEAKER_00]: future you can't during surge times
produce perfect synchrony a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons to your demand cycle you have to
always over produce energy according to
[SPEAKER_00]: what you think your demands going to be
and a lot of times that energy is wasted
[SPEAKER_00]: in heat and off gassed and into the
environment well Bitcoin miners have found
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice symbiotic home with many power
plants in which case they can return some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that wasted energy and thread it
through ASIC cards to mine bitcoins and
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively produce a form of digital cash
so this is waste getting turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: internet security and this symbiotic
relationship with our energy sector and
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet economy is creating the
largest trusted network of information in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world so this is an evolutionary force
we've never seen before and the rate at
[SPEAKER_00]: which it's growing is quite hyperbolic it
is an exponential growth pattern that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeing in Bitcoin and we see no
signs of this stopping now you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider if you're a hacker how are you
going to attack this thing right there's
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 nodes around the world they have a
tremendous economic interest in making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure all the data is exactly the same on
all of these nodes so for you to hack them
[SPEAKER_00]: you would have to hack all of them
simultaneously you're not going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to go down to Janet Yellen and convince
her to move the interest rates one way or
[SPEAKER_00]: the other to help your cause this is not a
group at the SEC that might have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies that used to work at a former bank
and they sometimes have a revolving door
[SPEAKER_00]: between those roles and people start to
wonder whether the regulation is really an
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerant to corporate power whether it's
in fact doing its job as a regulator who
[SPEAKER_00]: regulates the regulators when these things
get overly centralized well there's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: case of Bitcoin the decentralization means
there's no one to bribe lobby or coerce
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to just earn your merit on the
network according to your CPU cycles so
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing has a heartbeat this is how it
works basically every 10 minutes you get
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of global transactions get pulled
into a block and this block is not
[SPEAKER_00]: officially part of a chain until some
magic is done on it and this magic is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call a cryptographic online Sudoku
competition okay so this is a process
[SPEAKER_00]: where all of these new blocks if they want
to be joined to the chain they have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cryptographically woven into that chain
and the way that weaving happens is
[SPEAKER_00]: through a hashing process where the
computers compete to solve a hash with an
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown set of characters added to it so
this is kind of like a Sudoku puzzle where
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers of rows and columns can be
dynamically extended according to how many
[SPEAKER_00]: computers are competing on the problem so
if let's say a block happens to be solved
[SPEAKER_00]: in 15 minutes the computer code knows okay
make it a little easier so we try and aim
[SPEAKER_00]: for 10 minutes and if it goes faster down
to down to six minutes it says okay the
[SPEAKER_00]: computer capacity of the network is is now
too high we have to adjust the difficulty
[SPEAKER_00]: add some rows and columns to the Sudoku
puzzle and see if they can solve the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and the first one who does gets a
reward now the reason the Sudoku analogy
[SPEAKER_00]: is used in here it's not exactly what's
going on but the reason the analogy
[SPEAKER_00]: resonates with a lot of people is that
this is an algorithm with a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic that it is difficult to
solve but easy to verify so Sudoku puzzles
[SPEAKER_00]: can take a long time to solve but you just
check the rows and columns that they add
[SPEAKER_00]: up and you know that you can verify them
very quickly that's incredibly important
[SPEAKER_00]: for the game theoretics of the network the
moment the first person finds a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the other miners on the network
confirm that that solution is correct and
[SPEAKER_00]: since it's easy to verify they quickly
move on to mining the next block because
[SPEAKER_00]: the next reward the existing reward
they're working on has already been
[SPEAKER_00]: claimed they have to go now compute the
next one now the reward is very important
[SPEAKER_00]: the reward right now is 12.5 bitcoins
which happens to be about 60 grand every
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 minutes that are being handed out for
this prize this reward means lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: computers want to try and earn that 60
grand and they all compete in what is
[SPEAKER_00]: known to be a mathematical problem that's
fairly random the computer which first
[SPEAKER_00]: hits this is not us you know intelligently
coded in any way it's just really who can
[SPEAKER_00]: crunch the most amount of flip as many
bits as possible on highly designed chips
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to the answer the first and there's
just tremendous amount of luck involved
[SPEAKER_00]: nevertheless you do this enough you'll get
lucky enough and on average miners can
[SPEAKER_00]: predict their earnings and their
profitability based on how many of these
[SPEAKER_00]: block rewards that they're going to cover
in any given day so this creates a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous amount of incentive for the
miners to continually mine and it also
[SPEAKER_00]: means that you know every single block
that's been mined you know that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: mined at this particular time stamp you
probably know the you can estimate the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of the energy at that time that went
into mining that block the amount of CPU
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles you know the difficulty that was
involved in other words how big the stoker
[SPEAKER_00]: puzzle was so every block is kind of
etched with this information about well
[SPEAKER_00]: this one required so many watts of energy
to produce and if you wanted to remake
[SPEAKER_00]: this block and change it well you've got
all these other computers in the network
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't want to replicate a different
block they've all agreed on what that
[SPEAKER_00]: block is it's been replicated all over the
network and so this becomes very difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to hack in fact if you wanted to go back
let's say 10 or 20 blocks to change a
[SPEAKER_00]: value and redirect a million dollars
toward you instead of somebody else you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have to recompute all of those 10 blocks
faster than the entire network can do the
[SPEAKER_00]: next 10 minutes and that's what that's
what's really built in the security of
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing is that there isn't enough
compute power on earth to actually race
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing and if you had that compute
power you'd probably be better off just
[SPEAKER_00]: mining Bitcoin and earning some real money
so this kind of aligns people's interests
[SPEAKER_00]: and creates what they call a game
theoretic to keep miners rewarded for
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing internet consistency and
consensus on a ledger it's called a
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed consensus algorithm so this
you have to step back and realize this
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupts all industries just because it
has a source of money now that's trading
[SPEAKER_00]: for probably about 70 billion dollars
bigger than PayPal and Netflix and growing
[SPEAKER_00]: much faster than most of those companies
you realize once you can do this you can
[SPEAKER_00]: move stocks and you don't need a NASDAQ
you don't need a centralized
[SPEAKER_00]: reapothecation center that might be doing
escrows and all of these the stock market
[SPEAKER_00]: transactions money suddenly becomes an app
it's not a central bank two to three
[SPEAKER_00]: billion people that are unbanked today
will be coming into the economy shortly
[SPEAKER_00]: because they just need a $25 cell phone to
get banked much cheaper than other
[SPEAKER_00]: previous hurdles there's a 600 billion
dollars of remittance remittances that
[SPEAKER_00]: move across borders these are people who
move out of their country and want to send
[SPEAKER_00]: money home well all that goes through
channels right now that are incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: slow and take 10 to 20 percent of the
money you can do this through Bitcoin with
[SPEAKER_00]: very very very low fees and this has also
led to the largest global Kickstarter in
[SPEAKER_00]: history with the the ICO market these are
initial coin offerings people are now
[SPEAKER_00]: issuing their own crypto coins for their
companies so that people can buy those and
[SPEAKER_00]: liquidate those much faster than you can
buy liquidate traditional private
[SPEAKER_00]: investment vehicles like private company
stocks this also becomes a form of
[SPEAKER_00]: scarcity for digital content if you have
cryptographic keys on content then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: move music around like this and not have
to worry about pirating there are land
[SPEAKER_00]: titles that are going on the blockchain
stocks media IP voting and smart contracts
[SPEAKER_00]: smart contracts are pieces of code that
you can put in certain blockchains that
[SPEAKER_00]: are self-execution self-executable and as
a result these can be can trigger other
[SPEAKER_00]: things to own cars or and pay for cars you
can imagine cars actually owning bitcoins
[SPEAKER_00]: and being able to if they can drive
themselves they can become emancipated
[SPEAKER_00]: taxi cabs that figure out how to pay for
their own maintenance and etc these days
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming with now that money is no
longer tied to a person it can actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: tied to any given thing that can that can
code so this really redefines our
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of money in peer-to-peer
economies so we mentioned IP in here so
[SPEAKER_00]: what does this have to do with cannabis
well canvas has a lot of these kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: patents that are emerging right now and
there's this big nasty strain name game
[SPEAKER_00]: where no one believes what strain is what
so you go into a dispensary and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see the typical spreads that you might see
in a liquor store where you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred dollar bottle of wine or a ten
dollar bottle of wine you don't get those
[SPEAKER_00]: spreads in cannabis dispensaries because
nobody actually believes the labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and they shouldn't because if you
do any DNA sequencing in space you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: realize it's all made up and there's very
little consistency between people who
[SPEAKER_00]: claim one strain is some marquee strain
well quickly thereafter people just start
[SPEAKER_00]: relabeling other strains the strain that
captures a little bit more money and it
[SPEAKER_00]: self equilibrate equilibrates in the
marketplace so we don't have really good
[SPEAKER_00]: tools for proving that a trademark or a
given strain is what it is and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: with wider legalization the tools of
traditionally doing this will be utilized
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are we're seeing cannabis patents
emerge and many more have emerged since
[SPEAKER_00]: this one there's one for equatorial sativa
line that even this patent has gotten even
[SPEAKER_00]: broader and so these days are coming so so
what do you do lots of cannabis patents
[SPEAKER_00]: are emerging and you don't have the cash
to necessarily play the game of the gamble
[SPEAKER_00]: of a hundred thousand dollar patents a lot
of people look for defensive IP which is
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially cheaper and probably more
effective you'll see this in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies like Twitter and in companies
like Tulsa or Tesla they are making
[SPEAKER_00]: different positions with with their IP
because the cost of IP these days has been
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of escalating yet its longevity
is kind of decaying patents sometimes take
[SPEAKER_00]: 32 months to issue and sometimes your
patents extinct before the time that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: up so defensive IP seems to be another
alternative people who use our tools here
[SPEAKER_00]: use both but nevertheless there is
something in the the plant patent statute
[SPEAKER_00]: known as a prior use exemption clause so
if you have proof of business use one year
[SPEAKER_00]: before the patents has issued this is like
a grandfather clause so you can basically
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrate that hey I've been using this
in a business setting your patent that
[SPEAKER_00]: just submarineed on me doesn't apply to me
because I have proof of prior use so how
[SPEAKER_00]: do you get that do you briefly and a
picture on the internet it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it you really need to get this thing
notarized federal banks are probably not a
[SPEAKER_00]: good place to go and get this notarized
and I wouldn't suggest putting this
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily federal databases either
because those have been known to be shut
[SPEAKER_00]: down whenever the government has a budget
crisis you'll notice the first things they
[SPEAKER_00]: turn off of the things that people love
like the library of medicine and the
[SPEAKER_00]: national parks those things are the first
thing ripped away from the people as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to the you know the all types of
the military industrial things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being burnt that no one has any visibility
on no those won't stop but yeah we'll take
[SPEAKER_00]: away the goods so those databases we've
seen disappear with this this brings
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchains into picture saying why don't
we store this information on this global
[SPEAKER_00]: ledger that is immutable and can't be
taken down and as a has a hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: forty billion dollar network of trust that
is that's increasingly growing so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what we do with strain seek we have
genetic profiles recorded with a permanent
[SPEAKER_00]: time stamp blockchain record it's disaster
proof its credentials can be given to the
[SPEAKER_00]: customer this provides legal proof of
prior existence and enables prior use
[SPEAKER_00]: exemption for submarine patents and
they're coming down the way and just to
[SPEAKER_00]: contrast this with how we used to do
things the old way of doing things well we
[SPEAKER_00]: were always worried about the asymmetric
cost of invalidating a patent it tends to
[SPEAKER_00]: fall on the entrepreneur in that if you
want to re-examine a patent you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to spend a hundred thousand
dollars or more in an ex parte
[SPEAKER_00]: re-examination and this happens all the
time where bunk patents get issued and
[SPEAKER_00]: remain unchallenged because it's cheaper
to pay off the troll than it is to pay the
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyers to do the validation process
alright so you also have to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: humankind is doubling all of human data
every four months and so having a
[SPEAKER_00]: centralized agency like the USPTO trying
to keep up with all of the existing
[SPEAKER_00]: information that's in terms of prior art
this is a very difficult problem and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are notorious at not being incentivized to
do it correctly if they make mistakes
[SPEAKER_00]: you're still filing them paperwork to to
reverse those mistakes if they don't pay
[SPEAKER_00]: for the mistakes you do so the incentives
aren't aligned correctly here and so as a
[SPEAKER_00]: result we get lots of patents that issue
that are bogus that you then have to dance
[SPEAKER_00]: around as a small entity or come up with a
defensive IP strategy which is oftentimes
[SPEAKER_00]: more effective and cheaper the way we did
this back in 2011 which you know had we
[SPEAKER_00]: known about Bitcoin we would have probably
done it differently but at the time we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't well aware of it as we just filed
a provisional patent to the USPTO so they
[SPEAKER_00]: have it on record and they can't miss it
in a preliminary search report and then
[SPEAKER_00]: abandon the patent so we don't have to pay
for the rest of the expenses of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it to have a questionable patent on
genes being public we said I forget it
[SPEAKER_00]: let's make it a an open market here and
have freedom to operate this can be much
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper than having to prosecute a patent
all the way into existence and then figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out how to actually police that patent
into a somewhat gray market so the old way
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing things would cost us more than
$200,000 in sequencing costs and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: more than $20,000 in legal fees and
resulted in an abandoned patent on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis genome so that high THC strains
should be in the open domain here on
[SPEAKER_00]: forward now how do we do this today well
we've gotten this down to be only $500 in
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing costs and 50 bucks in a Bitcoin
transaction phase so this is a 400x
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement getting cannabis proof of
existence completed and we can now
[SPEAKER_00]: automate this and do this for everybody so
that your strains end up being public and
[SPEAKER_00]: defendable and you have proof of power use
sitting on the link to the blockchain now
[SPEAKER_00]: we always encourage people to download
their own data so that you replicate our
[SPEAKER_00]: version of this data yes we have the
timestamps in the blockchain we cannot fit
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire DNA sequence profile in the
blockchain because it's too much data we
[SPEAKER_00]: just have a hash digest of that data and
so you have to keep the source of that
[SPEAKER_00]: hash has to get distributed and kept safe
and so that's on the customer they take
[SPEAKER_00]: those VCF files and store them in other
places I'd recommend to IPFS and other
[SPEAKER_00]: types of encrypted distributed data stores
but nevertheless the hash is replicated
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the world and that is what will
what your file will always produce when
[SPEAKER_00]: you run SHA256 on it and that's in the
blockchain the other thing we do is we
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence 25 times more sequence than any
other sequence provider out there we
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence 3.2 million bases this is an
important number to ask because if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: very low number of bases they're
sequencing well you really don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: whether something's unique so more bases
the better eventually this will be whole
[SPEAKER_00]: genome shotgun you get about 50,000 SNPs
out of it we also tile 34 cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene genes in the process and we run
this Rosetta Stone SNP panel so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can triangulate our data with everything
else that's been put public to date so MGC
[SPEAKER_00]: which has been to soil genomics,
Soiler and Lynch and Phyllis have all put
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of strains public but none of
them have sequenced them with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: methods and so none of that data can be
cross-compared the only thing that can
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-compare them is this Rosetta Stone
that we built which sequences hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs across all of the same low side that
they've all published before and so now we
[SPEAKER_00]: can uniquely place something in the tree
no one else can do this if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing for you they don't know whether
their stuff is unique in our database and
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it is unique and all the other
public databases so they're just giving
[SPEAKER_00]: you a sense that you're unique based on
their own private database and this is no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer going to remain private this whole
field is going to go blockchain it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be public and they'll be distributed
ledgers of cannabis IP and genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: circulating we've been doing this for
several years there's already hundreds and
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of strains that have been have
been fingerprinted into the blockchain
[SPEAKER_00]: this also gives you a relationship to all
the other samples out there may teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: what things to breed with it gives you
this indelible timestamp and you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice page published at Canapedia to show
off your strain with all the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpene profile information hosted
there with the blockchain information so
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to learn more about these
types of things please join us at Canmet
[SPEAKER_00]: we're always intersecting these wild and
different fields with the cannabis field
[SPEAKER_00]: so and with that please leave any comments
or questions below and we will get to them
[SPEAKER_00]: as we can thank you
