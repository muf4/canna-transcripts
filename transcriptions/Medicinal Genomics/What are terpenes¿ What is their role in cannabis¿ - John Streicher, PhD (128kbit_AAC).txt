[SPEAKER_01]: Give us an overview of what they are and
what their role is in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ben, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes themselves are not unique to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are small molecules that are
found in essentially all plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least all plants that I know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes them kind of unique for
cannabis is there's a lot of them in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, more of them than there are tend
to be in other plants like hops or pine or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is a terpene?
[SPEAKER_00]: A terpene is a small simple molecule,
like it's small, very aromatic,
[SPEAKER_00]: very small, very hydrophobic slash
lipophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So small molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've sort of known about these
molecules for many years, because as you
[SPEAKER_00]: just said, they add to the taste and aroma
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have something like,
you know, even if you don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are, you kind of still experience
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you smell that fresh lemony smell from
a real lemon, not the stuff that comes in
[SPEAKER_00]: a can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's delimiting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a that's a terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smell that smell coming off of hops,
that's alpha humuline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the pine tree smell,
that's beta pining and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've all experienced terpenes,
even if you haven't run across that term
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in terms of what they do in
cannabis, yes, of course, they add to that
[SPEAKER_00]: unique aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, parenthetically, they actually
are not what give cannabis that real
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've actually isolated or weed or not
the ones that isolated our collaborators
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated that compound called parental
thiol, working with it separately,
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually has different activity than
either the terpenes or the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just to kind of a side note there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not exactly that skunky smell,
but some of the other taste and aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: elements of the plant are from these
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course, for many years,
now people have been looking, we sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: knew that it did this taste and aroma,
but people have suspected that these have
[SPEAKER_00]: had therapeutic and pharmacological
effects going back some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those have been under active
investigation in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as also as you suggested,
that people have suggested that these
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes contribute to the entourage
effect, the idea that the terpenes might
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow combine with the cannabinoids to
give you an effect unique to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you wouldn't get from either one
purified alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there were sort of all these ideas
floating around, there had been some
[SPEAKER_00]: studies, particularly in pain,
suggesting that terpenes could relieve
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, even clinical studies had shown
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were some real limitations in
the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there still is no solid evidence
whether or not the entourage effect
[SPEAKER_00]: actually occurs in like a cannabis extract
that you yourself are taking or smoking or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of surveyed this landscape
and about 2020 is when we started our work
[SPEAKER_00]: in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, okay, you know, there's a lot of
suggestions, but not a lot of hard data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's drill down and figure out what
these molecules are actually doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than just kind of throwing around
ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started by isolating the
terpenes and studying each one
[SPEAKER_00]: individually, rather than, as you say,
combined into this kind of this mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: this extract so that we could really
figure out what each one does alone before
[SPEAKER_00]: we start looking at them in combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've published that initial work
in 2021, showing that the terpenes have
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call a cannabimimetic effect,
that they behaviorally, they look like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid, although they are not a
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their mechanism is a little bit
different than a typical cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, it produced some of these
same effects in animals like sedation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of the couch lock or couch high
that you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catalypsy, a decrease in body temperature,
pain relief, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it had these effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, in terms of the
entourage effect, when we combined the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene with a cannabinoid, a synthetic
cannabinoid, we got a higher impact than
[SPEAKER_00]: either one alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what got us the most
attention in 2021 was this idea that the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes were having this effect and that
the effect could be greater when you
[SPEAKER_00]: combine them with a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what really got our journey
started in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do terpenes interact with the human
body, particularly in relation to pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is still, you know, really a big
unknown question, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not completely unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been, as I mentioned,
clinical studies, other studies showing
[SPEAKER_00]: that the terpenes relieve pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even like, say, a study where they
would give a little to laboring women,
[SPEAKER_00]: like women in labor giving birth,
and it showed that they had this benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other studies looking at
crisis and chronic pain patients and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the terpene, you see this benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still, even when you know
that, there's still a lot of unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, like, we all know the
terpenes have a strong smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that humans have a strong
placebo effect when they're exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: what they think is a medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I haven't seen any well-controlled
studies that suggest that the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: effect is separate from the placebo
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mechanism is also unknown,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how this, if it is relieving
pain, how it's relieving pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we try to tackle in
our own work by, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: working with mice who do not kind of have
this expectation that a human being does.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, we are injecting the
terpene so they couldn't get like that
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma or that smell to sort of confound
the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at the mice and then also
figuring out mechanism and diving in and
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out exactly what these are
interacting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least in mice, we now have data
that suggests that these terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulating the cannabinoid receptors in
your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of the known cannabinoids that are
going to be, or sorry, known cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors that are going to be stimulated
by drugs like THC and also your endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that your own body produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that they can bind to and
activate a receptor called the adenosine
[SPEAKER_00]: A2A receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is one of those targets
all of you know about, even if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: never heard that word before, because
that's the same receptor that's targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: by caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've all stimulated or inhibited our
adenosine A2A receptors whether you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it or not, because we do it through
caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the terpene stimulate,
at least in the mice, this receptor to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a strong pain relief in a chronic
and neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
Thanks for
watching.
See you next time.
