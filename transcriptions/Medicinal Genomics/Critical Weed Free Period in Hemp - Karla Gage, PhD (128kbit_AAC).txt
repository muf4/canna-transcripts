[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that my lab has been
working on, we do have some funding from
[SPEAKER_01]: the USDA as part of a larger multi-state
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been looking at what is called
the critical weed-free period in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all crops have this sort of
theoretical concept where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can control the weeds during so
many weeks initially as the crops get
[SPEAKER_01]: established, then you can maintain,
you know, reasonable yields by the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this critical period when
plants are more sensitive to competition
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to really take care of the
weeds during that period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we were looking at this and there
were students in my lab that were weeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: hand weeding our hemp plots at different
intervals throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the plots were not weeded at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we planted the hemp and walked
away basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a treatment that was
only weeded for a week and then two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: and three weeks and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was one treatment that was
weeded for the entire season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were all a little surprised when we
did a preliminary analysis of the data and
[SPEAKER_01]: we found that statistically there was no
difference whether or not we didn't weed
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants at all or whether we weeded for
87 days, which was the entire season.
Wow.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we thought as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could see a little bit of evidence for
heavy grass competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could see that the plots were where
there was a lot of grass competing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were our 14 day weed treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we could see a hit in the overall
biomass with some of the competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just amazing that statistically
there was no difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're now in our second year of that
study and we'll be doing a more detailed
[SPEAKER_01]: data analysis and we'll be looking at all
the different yield components because
[SPEAKER_01]: that was just a rough look at overall
biomass of fiber and dual purpose crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it seems like it's one of those
crops where if it gets a head start,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fairly competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So timing is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but so I just want to make sure I
heard that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amount that you weeded whether you
did none at all or you weeded throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole thing, it didn't have an effect
on the overall yield at the end?
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the overall biomass that was produced,
not looking at quality of fiber or amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of seed yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just overall plant biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there may be differences for each of
those components, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants will, it's an investment
strategy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they may have been investing in growth
and in structure and putting less into
[SPEAKER_01]: seed production, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we have two years of data,
I hope that we're able to sort of tease
[SPEAKER_01]: apart any of those differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we do have, of course,
we have a pre-emergence herbicide that's
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if farmers want to grow hemp now,
there's more tools available to give the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp a head start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.
