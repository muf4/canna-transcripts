[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I did want to ask you about,
um, the women's health initiative at mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's mentioned in your abstract as
something that you guys are looking into
[SPEAKER_01]: or sort of expanding into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so please share about that and sort of
what, what conditions are you looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wim or the women's health initiative at
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted something that was catchy
where I could say not just a whim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, over a billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always with the puns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a billion individuals are affected by
things like gynecologic pain in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's largely understudied.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an underserved population for a
million different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are lots of reasons to explore
the potential application of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids in these conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we did a number of
survey-based studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were my first real survey-based
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had done a little bit of work in this
area before, but it could have been with,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, perimenopausal, menopausal and
postmenopausal disruption and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a survey study that was a bit of an
adjacent clinical, um, uh, investigation
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals who are using a commercially
available vaginal suppository for
[SPEAKER_00]: menstrual related dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have our very first,
uh, project that's funded to look at women
[SPEAKER_00]: with endometriosis using a whole plant
full spectrum product that I made for
[SPEAKER_00]: folks with endometriosis and related pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of interest here and
people are using these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem that I often hear about is
patients will tell you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, my friend used this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'll just try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, wouldn't it be great to actually
have data that could help individuals be
[SPEAKER_00]: informed about what products they should
and maybe shouldn't be exploring?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, just the thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's, that's, I think a rather
exciting area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, endometriosis is, is one of those
conditions that so many are affected by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many are affected by the number of
symptoms is rather staggering when you
[SPEAKER_00]: really start looking at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you can improve the quality of
life and you can reduce discomfort and
[SPEAKER_00]: increase people's ability to sleep and be
less, again, either less anxious or have
[SPEAKER_00]: less pain or all of the above,
why wouldn't you try?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have a presenter last year who
talked about that and it was sort of more
[SPEAKER_01]: exploratory of, you know, could
cannabinoids potentially be a good
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it sounds like now you're actually
investigating that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's every reason to think so,
given the relationship between the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, this endogenous
system, you know, chemicals and receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the brain and body and the,
and the gynecologic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, when we think of the ways that
we're all sort of wired, why wouldn't you
[SPEAKER_00]: try to harness the most powerful things
that you could that are potentially less
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive or less disruptive to other
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, if it isn't likely to do a
ton of harm and could potentially help,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all for trying to see what,
what we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
