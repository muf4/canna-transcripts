[SPEAKER_00]: And now I know just, just this last fall,
the ANA officially recognized cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: nursing as a specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how important was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is, I don't think we
have yet come to terms with like the
[SPEAKER_01]: gravity of that, because what that means,
this is the first, you know, healthcare
[SPEAKER_01]: organization, association, that has
recognized, you know, cannabis as the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that we get to start
treating cannabis as the real medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: that it is, you know, the medical,
the physician's organization, the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacist's organizations, they haven't
come out and named their own specialties
[SPEAKER_01]: yet in cannabis and nursing is the first
one to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that we're well on our way
to treating and recognize, recognizing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as, as a true therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I'm sure you're, there has to be a
little bit of pride there that your,
[SPEAKER_00]: that your profession was the first to
recognize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, nursing is going on 20,
I think it's 20 plus years of being the
[SPEAKER_01]: most trusted profession in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that nurses are, cannabis
nurses are being officially recognized is
[SPEAKER_01]: really huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that more, that means that
more people who are scared to try cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to find that, that hand to hold
them in a nurse and guide them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause trust really is important with
cannabis medicine because it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a bit of a journey and there's trial
and error and there's some experimentation
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that trust is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
