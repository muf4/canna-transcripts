[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I come at this from a different
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a medical doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the different hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at Children's Hospital Los Angeles,
medical genetics, about 70% clinical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a faculty appointment at the USC
Medical School.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been focusing on children,
particularly with multiple functional
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, pain, fatigue, GI problems,
dysautonomia, autism, and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a huge number of children
with those kind of problems in any clinic
[SPEAKER_00]: and anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's the number one reason why
people have disability or days off of
[SPEAKER_00]: school or work is because of functional
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is very little research on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And realizing that the academic world was
moving too slow on this, joined Cortigen
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to go quicker into bringing the
amazing things that we can do,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Human Genome Project and the new
information on genetic genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics and bring it to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be looking at it from the
perspective of a physician, a researcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: and company man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, everything is off label.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it's the concept of
functional disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Functional disease comes by many labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Western world just 100 years ago
and in much of the world today and in much
[SPEAKER_00]: of the nontraditional medical established
management in the United States and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Western world, this is all looked at as
one problem, one disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's looked at as an imbalance,
some sort of imbalance in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the Western medical model,
you have doctors that look at the heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: another doctor looks at the kidney,
another doctor looks at the ear,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's sort of gotten balkanized like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll have a patient that will go
in and will say that they have irritable
[SPEAKER_00]: bowel problems and then get a diagnosis by
a GI specialist, then goes to a
[SPEAKER_00]: psychiatrist gets a diagnosis of
depression, goes to a neurologist for
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine, goes to a rheumatologist for
complex regional pain syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: goes to a dentist for TMJ, and I can go on
and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many patients will have more than one
functional disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in a study that I helped run with
some students, we found that it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 or so was like among the average about
people that often go to medical care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your favorite disease is not on there,
this is just an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an idea to show you that these are
just descriptions of what's wrong with the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really diagnosis, but they are
extremely common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them like irritable bowel and
migraine or 15 to 20 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not different parts of the
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this doesn't translate to every
audience, but there's the metaphor
[SPEAKER_00]: actually comes from India originally about
the elephant and there's three blind men
[SPEAKER_00]: that are filling the elephant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One fills the trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: One fills the tail and one fills the body
and they describe three different animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can have blind doctors up there
filling all different parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: elephant and giving many different
diagnoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really the same patients that
have many of these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not only that, it's the same
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that over and over again,
I saw that the child comes in with cyclic
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what sort of I ended up
specializing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have migraine headache,
but the mother will have complex regional
[SPEAKER_00]: pain syndrome and depression and the aunt
will have irritable bowel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there'll be fibromyalgia in the
grandmother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start asking for these
conditions, you find that they're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first case that I want to tell
you about, this is one of the first free
[SPEAKER_00]: children that I had that has what I call
now trap one disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peyton, who's now 14 years old,
presented a few years ago when she was 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had cyclic vomiting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know what that
is, it's actually quite common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually misdiagnosis, migraine,
or stomach flu, or psychiatric disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had people be put in prison because
they thought that they were doing it to
[SPEAKER_00]: their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have episodes of nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're lethargic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the episodes can last 12 hours,
so they can last 12 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average is about three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can happen every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can happen every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can happen a couple times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average is every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average patient would be vomiting
three, four, five days and just be totally
[SPEAKER_00]: miserable, on IVs, often in a hospital,
and then go another 25 days, completely
[SPEAKER_00]: normal, and then have another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally disabling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't do school very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't hold a job like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she had that the first 10 years of her
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she developed chronic migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had migraine headache that was 24,
7, 365.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also had chronic pain throughout her
entire body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was not her major issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her major issue was the chronic fatigue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her chronic fatigue syndrome was so bad
that it was difficult for her to join the
[SPEAKER_00]: table for breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if she did that, she was completely
exhausted and had to go to bed the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a brilliant student, got stray
days, but was doing it from a home
[SPEAKER_00]: computer and can only concentrate a couple
hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also had multiple hospitalizations for
bowel cleanouts because her intestines
[SPEAKER_00]: would not work every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, based upon the technology that we
developed at Cortigen, we found that first
[SPEAKER_00]: of all, of course, we look for known
mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look for obvious mutations in about
1,200 genes that involve the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get to that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also are looking at polymorphisms
or variants in the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that some people do have
monogenic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an obvious mutation in a gene,
and that causes the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people that have fatigue and fain
and things like that is polygenic and
[SPEAKER_00]: multifactorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the whole thing is that there's
many genes, and there's many environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much longer than I've been in the
field, people have been talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until recently, it was just,
oh, it involves many genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now we can actually sequence all the
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I noticed on Peyton is that
she had a change in a gene on Trap1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a rare change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in 1% of the European population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a few other patients that had
exactly that same change, that had exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was putting the two together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a change here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that from isoleucine, this is P is
for protein, from isoleucine to valine at
[SPEAKER_00]: position 253.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a common, polymorphism.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% of the European population has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: About one half of 1% of the world
population has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it described a lot of the problems
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get to, this is involved in
antioxidant defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when she was put on very high
doses of many antioxidants, she got a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: She went to school, was there for maybe
two hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big difference from before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her pain had pretty much gone away,
and she no longer needed bowel cleanups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Trap1 is, is it is a homo dimer
that's just two copies of the same peptide
[SPEAKER_00]: that are scrunched together, and it is a
chaperone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what chaperones are in the
classical sense, is that they take things
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're supposed to go, and they're
not supposed to do things they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to do on the way there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a molecular chaperone takes the
proteins, the polypeptides that are made
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ribosome, and it takes them where
they're supposed to go, and they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to fold incorrectly on the way
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get to where they're
supposed to go, and then they have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what they need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what a molecular chaperone is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Trap1 is the main chaperone in the
mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of chaperones in the
cytoplasm, other organs, other things like
[SPEAKER_00]: endoplasmic reticulum have chaperones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the main mitochondrial
chaperone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 701 amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between amino acid 108 and 260,
it actually binds ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It binds ATP to, I mean, the molecule is
like a crab thing, and it goes like that
[SPEAKER_00]: when ATP is hydrolyzed, uses the energy of
ATP to smash the proteins together,
[SPEAKER_00]: fold them into the correct position.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have since found about 100 different
cases of Trap1, and they pretty much all
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same things, chronic pain,
fatigue, and GI dismotility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of other functional
problems that we have here, but these are
[SPEAKER_00]: the main three, and those are the ones we
have statistical viability for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they all get much better in
antioxidant proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here shows some of the data that has
been published last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot more data since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at chronic pain, chronic
fatigue, and GI dismotility, this means
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have all three of them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's all these
percentages and p-values.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really busy slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing I want to show you here,
this is the mutation that Peyton has.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is statistically associated with all of
these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have this mutation, you are 5.7
times more likely to have chronic pain
[SPEAKER_00]: than if you don't have the mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that don't have the mutation
were ones that were sent to Cortigen for
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, not just the regular population,
so a highly affected population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're 7.5 times more likely to have
pain, fatigue, and GI problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two other mutations that are on
this molecule that also cost the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call these the salt bridge mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's positive charge and one's negative
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it causes a strap that holds the ATP
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of these positions actually
physically touch the ATP molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the odds ratios are even higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're 18 times more likely to have pain,
fatigue, and GI problems if you have one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the two salt bridge mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the p-value is just not by chance
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the control group here was
other patients that were sent to Cortigen
[SPEAKER_00]: because of illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we did it versus a regular
population, the p-values get much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows you what the Trap1 molecule
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of the molecules of Trap1,
one of the proteins, and here's the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're exactly identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green here is the ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the three different
mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all touch the ATP molecule in a
crystal structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, can we design a,
antioxidants make a big difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've treated probably myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 20, 25 patients with Trap1,
and they all get a lot better on
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't cure them completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, can we use the
information on this molecule and design a
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment that goes directly to the
binding site and corrects the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: So using collaborators at Georgia Tech,
what they did is they used the crystal
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the Trap1 molecule that had
been done by x-ray crystallography and
[SPEAKER_00]: published, the human Trap1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they put it into the computer
system at Georgia Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then put all of these different
variants in it to show the tiny little
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take a look at it,
there's very tiny little differences to
[SPEAKER_00]: the binding site that these mutations
make, but not much at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they said they ran the entire
computer system over the weekend of
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia Tech and took every molecule known
to man and threw it into this binding site
[SPEAKER_00]: with the idea of finding a molecule which
binds to the mutant very tightly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but doesn't bind to the wild type almost
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we came up with
was something that a lot of you might have
[SPEAKER_00]: heard of is chytril.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chytril is a drug that's out there that's
used for chemotherapy-induced vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used it several times before this
came up in patients that Zofran wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work for nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has almost no side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, drug companies don't like
to pay for it because it's incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive, which has become an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he gave chytril to Peyton,
her disease just melted away completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, she is now full-time in school,
has no pain essentially at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: and has no chronic fatigue, no GI
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's basically completely well on that
drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the, putting all of these
different things together was able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second patient here is Thomas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the probing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that first brought to genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his sister, Kira.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kira has cyclic vomiting syndrome,
migraine, muscle weakness, depression,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been in and out of hospitals all her
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thomas is her younger brother who's now in
college.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had complex regional pain syndrome,
migraine, depression, a couple other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pedigree shows maternal inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, before we figured out that there
was trap one in this family, I used to use
[SPEAKER_00]: this exactly that slide in medical school
to show what maternal inheritance is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mitochondrial DNA comes from the egg,
not from the sperm, that your sequence is
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same as that of your mother
and all of your siblings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone that has a black symbol here,
by virtue of the relationship,
[SPEAKER_00]: has exactly the same mitochondrial DNA
sequence as the proband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone with a white symbol has a
different sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually sequenced everyone in the
family, so we know that for sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's just, it has to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the people that have black
symbols are more likely to have common
[SPEAKER_00]: functional disease than the people with
white symbols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's some functional
disease out there, and then some people
[SPEAKER_00]: here are, well, some people over here are
kind of normal, but the point is that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a risk factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone in the family has completely
different disease, so for decades we were
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, well, there is a nuclear modifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a gene on the chromosomes that
comes from one or the other parent that
[SPEAKER_00]: modifies this, so it's not just the
mitochondrial DNA, it's the DNA mutation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, by the way, it's a slip mutation
where there's a whole bunch of cytosines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just keeps slipping through the
polymerase, and so you get a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of them instead of a few in this family.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's more to it than that,
and we found out that the issue with
[SPEAKER_00]: Thomas is actually that he has a trap one
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I've already told you a bit
about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: His major problem is POTS, which is you
get syncope or fainting when you stand up
[SPEAKER_00]: or just ram in the leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would be in class, sitting in class,
and then just suddenly he would just fall
[SPEAKER_00]: down and go into seizure-like moments,
and they'd bring the paramedics and send
[SPEAKER_00]: him to the hospital, and it really wasn't
good for him being a high school student
[SPEAKER_00]: going through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got to the point that paramedics were
coming about once a month to the school.
[SPEAKER_00]: The school kicked him out because they
didn't want to take the liability,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so his life was pretty much ruined as
far as he was concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus he had some chronic fatigue syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was also on antioxidants had gotten a
lot better, he has a point mutation here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is actually, this means a stop
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The protein is disrupted at the point that
it binds with ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly how that's working,
we're not really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, his POTS got better on
high-dose arginine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third patient is, and this one has the
chronic, this one has the classic trap one
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little boy with autism,
and one of the things that I noticed is
[SPEAKER_00]: that in my first 20 or so trap one
patients that I had, over half the boys
[SPEAKER_00]: that had the trap one mutation had autism,
and when we started collecting data from
[SPEAKER_00]: across the country and abroad,
that a large, as many as a third to a half
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the boys with trap one had autism,
and it was statistically significant for
[SPEAKER_00]: the salt bridge mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, well, maybe that this is a
risk factor for autism as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I collected, this boy came to me,
with autism, and he presented the first
[SPEAKER_00]: year of life after the MMR vaccination.
[SPEAKER_00]: He developed autistic regression,
he was normal prior to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had laboratory disease,
laboratory testing suggested a
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found the common trap one variant in
him, and then the question is,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, what will the chytral do to this kid
who's just autistic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put him on chytral after informed consent,
and this is what the parents had mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: about that, that on chytral there was a
dramatic improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: He became more talkative, expressed
himself better, didn't fight with his
[SPEAKER_00]: siblings anymore, was more focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference is that they would
never even, they said they would never
[SPEAKER_00]: even think about going out to dinner with
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't even have a dinner at home
with him, he would just go crazy and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: things from the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they can go to a restaurant,
and he will sit quietly and eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is an amazing difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's not sedated or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you could say, well,
this could be a placebo effect or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, but then the pharmacy
ran out of the drug, and the insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: company started balking, and then he
regressed again when he went off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went back on the drug, and he's gotten
better again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the preschool teacher has never been
informed of these changes and had said the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing the parents did, that they are
associated with chytral therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes off the United Mitochondrial
Disease Foundation website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, almost anything can be from
mitochondrial disease is the way a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two things about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it is mostly neuromuscular
abnormalities, because the nerves and
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle require a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is that energy is
required for all cells, and so if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: have mitochondrial disease, you can have
problems in a lot of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I've been told that you guys are
going to get the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I've put together for
physicians to say, okay, mitochondrial
[SPEAKER_00]: disease can cause a lot of things,
but when do you most likely consider it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly not everyone with these problems
has mitochondrial disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be ridiculous, and certainly
there's a lot of people with mitochondrial
[SPEAKER_00]: disease that have things off of this
slide, but if you have two or more,
[SPEAKER_00]: and particularly if you have three or more
of these things, the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial disease is pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are what I call the red flags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just very, very basic 20-second biology,
the mitochondria is made from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial DNA, which is basically a
bacterial genome which was combined with
[SPEAKER_00]: an archaeogenome two billion years ago to
make all a mucariotic life.
[SPEAKER_00]: All complex life comes from that original
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: All complex life are symbiotes of two
different organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mitochondrial DNA has a completely
different genetic structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a different genetic code.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from your mother only,
but most of the proteins in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria are made from the nuclear
encoded proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 1,013 proteins by one count that
are made in the nucleus that go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have maternal inheritance from
mitochondrial DNA, or you can have the
[SPEAKER_00]: usual inheritance models from nuclear DNA
abnormalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can both cause mitochondrial disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you've seen in my patients I've shown
you so far, all the ones I've shown you so
[SPEAKER_00]: far have mutations in both of those,
which makes them bigenomic and much more
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is just to show you the
metabolic pathways are very involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these and many, many more types of
proteins are necessary for every enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something that has to transcribe
it, to translate it, to glycosylate it,
[SPEAKER_00]: to chaperone it, to, you know,
all the different things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary for each metabolic enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that what Cortogen has is it has
two test products, one for the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial DNA, one for the nuclear DNA
that look at all 1,200 proteins in great
[SPEAKER_00]: detail looking for genotype-phenotype
correlations to be able to make this sort
