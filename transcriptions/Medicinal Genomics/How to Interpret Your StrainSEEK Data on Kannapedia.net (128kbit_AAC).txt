[SPEAKER_00]: All right, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're gonna go over how to interpret
your DNA sequencing results from a strain
[SPEAKER_00]: seek report.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several different ways that we
sequence for clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain seek is one of the more popular
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sequence is about 3.2 million bases
in the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is different than the whole genome
sequencing service we have, which
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences every base over 800 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the strain seek tool is a good cheap
way to get in and get some surveying done.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are using this for
intellectual property protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you actually look into the patent
office, you'll see many plant patents out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that have names that are actually in
Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably the most popular tool for
cataloging novel strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also very helpful for breeding
because there's lots of information in
[SPEAKER_00]: these reports that we're gonna go through
that can help you through breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go through some of the tools
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do sequence with us, the
SureSelect system from Agilent is being
[SPEAKER_00]: used in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some panels that we're
developing with Arbor, and you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: those shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this sequence is 3.2 million bases in
the plant, and it does it with a targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridization capture that can collect any
region of the genome and sequence it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have selected around
25,000 SNPs that can be detected with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've also tiled some key genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 926 genes have variants in them that
you can track as tag SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also target CBD synthase,
THC synthase, and abacromine synthase very
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily so you can get full gene coverage
over those genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means you can look for those genes,
mutations in those genes, or if those
[SPEAKER_00]: genes are deleted with this tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of a sample known as
Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream's quite common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can tell by this report over
here on the right, this is a violin plot
[SPEAKER_00]: that tells you how similar your strain is
to everything else in the database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strains that have a lot of
commonalities to other plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: database have a fairly bottom-heavy violin
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a very rare plot, you will see
this plot change if it's a very rare
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will become more top-heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see more of the strains in the
database being very distant from your
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically a density plot of the
strains that are in the database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lower this gets, the closer it is
to your strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as this becomes more bottom-heavy,
you have a more common strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This becomes more top-heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a more rare strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the descriptions are right down
here and will pop up for you to describe
[SPEAKER_00]: what these mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we collect an RSP number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a number that is unique in the
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unique to your cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we often collect other bits of
information that people provide with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample submission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they will supply us with
cannabinoid turbine information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see that in a couple of
reports going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that we tend to look at
here is the heterozygosity plot over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tells you how different you are from
the reference genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reference genome that we're using here
is Jamaican Lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this published in a preprint that
you can view here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This preprint here has 42 other genomes
aligned to the Jamaican Lion genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are whole genome sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some RNA sequence in here,
some ISO-seq, which is RNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some methylation data that's in
this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this data is also in a genome
browser known as COGI, which we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to touch on in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the reference that we're
comparing everything to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your heterozygosity is a number of
variants that differ from that reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we calculate those and quantitate how
heterozygous your plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're breeding for plants to become
more stable and produce more stable seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to see this green line move more
in this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does less heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what a lot of people do is they
back cross to watch this thing move in
[SPEAKER_00]: that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little pop up here that
describes the heterozygosity as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other most important thing
we're going to look at is the coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: over particular genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sequencing read coverage over what
we've identified as the BT-BD allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BT-BD allele, Etienne de Meyer
published, they theorized that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: regions in the genome that dictate whether
the plant is going to make THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, so while Etienne de Meyer theorized
that there were markers in the genome that
[SPEAKER_00]: might track with this, they did not
actually distill down the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: locations that might drive this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we spent a lot of time sequencing
many genomes to try and sort this problem
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of preprints that
describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lo and behold, there's a couple of
ways that this BT-BD allele actually
[SPEAKER_00]: operates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like convergent evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not one solution to the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the vast majority of the genotypes we
see out there are related to deletions of
[SPEAKER_00]: entire genes.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple other markers have been
described in the past known as the BT-BD
[SPEAKER_00]: allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't actually reside in the THC
synthase or CBD synthase genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a result of their distance from the
genes, they may not be 100% predictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've switched to is actually
monitoring the presence and absence of
[SPEAKER_00]: these DNA sequences, the genes themselves
in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we have these really great
references, we can count how many
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid synthase genes are present in
your genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what these plots are depicting
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're depicting your Illumina sequence
coverage over the CBD synthase gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on CONTIG 1772 in the Jamaican Lion
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's also looking at the DNA
sequence coverage over CONTIG 7741 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican Lion reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which has THC synthase in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has a neighboring gene that looks
a lot like CBD synthase but is broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call inactive CBD
synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens to be in very close proximity
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're only tracking this CBD
synthase as a confirmation of this marker
[SPEAKER_00]: and to also try and track how large this
deletion is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we tend to see in most genomes is
full deletions of the CBD synthase gene or
[SPEAKER_00]: full deletions of the THC synthase gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it usually embodies this neighboring
cannabinoid synthase gene as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little bit redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This blue marker should almost always
correlate with this green one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, you have something unique
where the deletion might be a partial
[SPEAKER_00]: deletion and it's taking out just a piece
of this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's probably chemotypically
irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that we're just tracking
to get a better size of the deletion of
[SPEAKER_00]: that gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this can be very helpful in
deciding whether you have type 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 or 3 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a complicated loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things that can go
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I said convergent evolution before.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that means there's a couple of
different ways that you can kill THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either delete the entire gene or
you can have point mutations in the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: that knock out its function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RNA is probably still made.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the protein that gets made from
that gene does not fold a CBG into an
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's the gene is there,
but it's not functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very very rare genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We very probably only three or four in the
database have point mutations like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have probably over a thousand in
there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is that's an exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a little bit hard to predict
because sometimes those point mutations
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't always in the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can often be novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of activity at the three
three three amino acid location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been published in one of our
preprints P three three three R.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a couple of other places we've
seen hit as well that are right now in
[SPEAKER_00]: private reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't speak to what those are,
but they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, when we have seen variants
in this gene, it's very rare they're the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There always seem to be somewhat private
and unique to to people's cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means they have something novel and
they usually end up reporting that to an
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property attorney or looking
into plant patents when they find
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, we're going to go through a
couple of these plants to show you how
[SPEAKER_00]: these graphs change from type one,
two, three and four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all of its relatives here that
are near clonal distances apart and some
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones a little bit further away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this chart down here has a clone
distance and a sibling distance and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little fuzzy area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason this is fuzzy is that you
can have some inbred plants that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: cross them, they come out with siblings
that blur this line a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most siblings get quite distant if the
parents are distant, but the parents are
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their siblings are going to come out a
little bit tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've actually have an inbred line,
you may see some of the siblings get
[SPEAKER_00]: closer and closer to this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, self plants tend to bend the
wools a little bit more this direction as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't by any means a hard and fast
definition of a clone sibling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a genetic distance score.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the better and better you get
inbreeding, the more you're going to move
[SPEAKER_00]: from sibling to clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's clearly a type one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a THC gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a CBD gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the original Jamaican lion
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the Jamaican lion that we did
the huge sequencing project on after we
[SPEAKER_00]: had sequenced the Jamaican lion reference
and put it out there suggesting it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: type two plant that might predate the
biotech patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeder of it came forward and gave us
the original from 2011 and we sequenced
[SPEAKER_00]: that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since this was the original from
2011, it was seven or eight years
[SPEAKER_00]: predating the one that we sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, it's not identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a clone, but it is got a very low
heterozygosity because we are comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy Menard's original Jamaican lion
from 2011 to the 2019 descendants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's going to be some
variation after breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the heterozygosity is way low on
the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in here a couple of these
Jamaican lions descendants are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: very close to that to the clonal distance
line because they are closely related to
[SPEAKER_00]: the original genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also notice we have an active CBD
gene and an active THC synthase gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means it's a type two plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this one's coming along for the
ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at Queen Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Queen Jesus is an interesting one that
we've sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a chemo type in the database and
you'll notice it doesn't make any
[SPEAKER_00]: kinetochromine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've also noticed is that we
need to add another plot here to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the kinetochromine genes because we do,
in fact, cover those in your strain secret
[SPEAKER_00]: report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would find that in this VCF file.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went and looked for kinetochromine,
there's eight of those genes on Contig
[SPEAKER_00]: 756.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can chart the coverage over those
genes to determine whether you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: kinetochromine deletion and get a plot
just like this for kinetochromine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we care about kinetochromine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's a plant that makes CBD,
doesn't have a THC synthase gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes a little THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a couple of theories and
there's a good paper I'll point you to
[SPEAKER_00]: from Zerbel that goes over this,
but you can, CBD synthase and THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase, and for that matter,
CBD synthase, they are not believed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pure enzymes in that they 100% make only
one cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're believed to be a little
promiscuous in that CBD synthase for most
[SPEAKER_00]: studies demonstrate a 23 to one ratio of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I'm sorry, of CBD to THC synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in plants.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now plants are very complicated to measure
this ratio in because plants have all like
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 other genes that look like cannabinoid
synthases that might be contributing to
[SPEAKER_00]: this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, most of those look a little
broken and distant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones that we really keep our eye on
are three genes in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC synthase, CBD synthase, and
cannabichromine synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all within 90% sequence identity
of each other and are likely the culprits
[SPEAKER_00]: for making the compounds that we're
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a CBD synthesis gene here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes lots of CBD, but this is probably
one of those 23 to one ratios where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: leaking some THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take CBD synthase and clone it into
yeast and start mucking around with a pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see that it can make varying
amounts of THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the gene is taken in isolation out
of the plant and put into a model organism
[SPEAKER_00]: and you ask it to give it precursor and
you ask it to make cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't make purely CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaks a little THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing is true with THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look in type one plants that don't
have any CBD synthase, there's still a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of residual CBD coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's likely THC synthase being
promiscuous and making a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although this one seems to be more
promiscuous of enzyme than this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to see a larger ratio of THC to
CBD with type one plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see with CBD to THC with type
three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this here is a type three plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we know this is there's sequence
coverage over the CBD gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't any over the THC synthesis,
THC synthase gene and its neighboring gene
[SPEAKER_00]: is gone too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at a type four plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, type four plants like Santhica 27
don't have any of the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are going to stop and make the
precursor CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't have the chemo type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This but if you look at some chemo types
online for type four plants, you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they don't have a THC gene and
they don't have a CBD gene, they still
[SPEAKER_00]: make a little bit of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is largely believed right now,
although it is hypothesis is largely
[SPEAKER_00]: believed to be coming from
cannabichromine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabichromine is the next closest
relative to these two other synthase
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, which is why we're soon going to
put a little cannabichromine synthase gene
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage map over here so you can chart
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current strain seek panel doesn't in
fact sequence cannabichromine synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's eight of those genes in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at the coverage at all eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do cover all eight and you can find
that in this VCF file here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to comb through the data
yourself, the best thing you could do at
[SPEAKER_00]: least if you're on a Mac is hit the
control button on your keyboard and then
[SPEAKER_00]: click on this and you'll get a window like
this to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to copy link.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to copy that link,
you can then download this to your Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason I am, we're going to go and
do some terminal is if you just click on
[SPEAKER_00]: that and you're on a Mac, it's going to
try and download a VCF file and some
[SPEAKER_00]: computers will auto open that file as if
it is a mail contact file.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of that, it will probably
corrupt the file and you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do it the old school way,
which is open up a terminal like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: type in a command called curl minus O for
output, copy and paste the link that you
[SPEAKER_00]: just copied and down comes your file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, actually I want to see what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I already have it downloaded here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's giving me a bit of an error,
but there's a VCF file right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's unzip that VCF file and we can
start to look at what that file looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't want to open it when it's zipped
because it'll be binary, be a big mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were to more of this file,
you're going to see a pretty big header.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tells you we embed all this stuff in
the VCF file because this is the file that
[SPEAKER_00]: we hash into a blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do that, you want to have the
people who send it in any of the limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: and terping information, any of any of the
CBD information, the chemo type we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: embed in the file.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the owner, the chemo type and the
genetics end up in a hash in a blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after this, the header is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give you the length of every
single content that's in the assembly,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a little boring, but you can skip
this header.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just grep the file with a minus V
command, it will skip over anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: has these pound commands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you how to do that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, what you're seeing is a list of
every content that's been sequenced,
[SPEAKER_00]: the coordinates and the base and how it
differs, whether it's low quality or a
[SPEAKER_00]: passing quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the important thing over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This genotype right there is zero zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it is heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see things that are zero one,
it means, I'm sorry, that means it's
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see things that are zero one,
it means it is heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see dots like this, it didn't
have enough coverage to make a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a low quality or it is right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all low quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In here are different bits of information
in terms of how many reads are covering it
[SPEAKER_00]: and quality scores and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look about what all these little
details mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just look up VCF files on the
Internet, it will explain to you the file
[SPEAKER_00]: format and all the other information
that's encoded in these comma separated
[SPEAKER_00]: forms over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is really the critical key
because this has your genotype right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing you want to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the coordinate and where.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inside this file, you're going to see
lots of different insertions and deletions
[SPEAKER_00]: and genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very big file because we are
covering 3.2 million bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get out of that and let's do a
little trick here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do grep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grep is a tool that will search this file
and minus V says, give me everything that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't match this mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to have any of the header
come through and the header is all
[SPEAKER_00]: demarcated with two pound signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, you'll get
everything that doesn't have the header
[SPEAKER_00]: file in that file.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just spits out everything that
doesn't have that in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's one way to search the file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we want to get every variant
that is on the THC synthase contig.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hit, we're going to use
grep again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I happen to know that that's contig
741 and we want to search for every
[SPEAKER_00]: variant that's on contig 741.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, what do we get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, doesn't have a GZ on it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, picks up the header and then you're
going to see it's going to spit out a long
[SPEAKER_00]: list of other variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are on that large contig.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is going to give you more
variants that are that are just in the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual genes themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an entire multi-megabase contig.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes out with a lot of variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you pipe that to word count,
it will tell you how many and give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: number for how many variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That word count counts the number of
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every line is a variant in the VCF
file.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just going to come back and
tell you, you've got X number of lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, you've got 20,000 variants on
that contig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big contig.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's too many to look through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pipe this to grep again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's look for only ones that are near
THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I happen to know there it's 441.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably, that'll get us close.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the ballpark.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's going to give us everything
that matches 741.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's going to pump it into,
I want everything that's got 741 and 4417.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4417 is a coordinate that's the beginning
of the THC gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of a sloppy search,
but it will still give us a smaller list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's going to search for that number
anywhere in here, and we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some off-target hits with 4417.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just a real quick tutorial on
where to find these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these coordinates are starting at
the gene, so this form, the sample doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any variance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might not be surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, in fact, a reference that
doesn't, that this probably has a knockout
[SPEAKER_00]: there because I think this is a type 3
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, hopefully this is a helpful
quick tutorial on how to start surfing
[SPEAKER_00]: around some of these files.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this VCF file is important to have
because you can take this file and load
[SPEAKER_00]: this into the Koji genome browser so that
you don't have to manage this terminal's
[SPEAKER_00]: junk and you can view it in a much more
user-friendly graphical user interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to touch on that in the next
tutorial, is how to take your VCF file and
[SPEAKER_00]: load it into Koji so that you can begin to
surf around this information in a genome
[SPEAKER_00]: browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's really step one of using
Canapedia and what some of these graphs
[SPEAKER_00]: mean and how to make the most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some other information down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a QR code, which is a
self-referencing QR code.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to scan that, it would go to
this URL.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that QR code encodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can put that on a product if you
want and anyone scans it, their phone will
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them to this page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of the blockchaining
certificates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we ever disappear or go out of
business, your data is still circulating
[SPEAKER_00]: on blockchains.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can click on these things and get
proof of your data's existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not putting this huge file
into a blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too big to go into a blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is putting a PDF or I'm sorry,
it's putting a hash of your data into the
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain, which is this short signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This signature represents your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you change one letter in that file,
this whole hash changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is such a unique number that it
only can represent your file.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can demonstrate that this
number exists in a time stamped blockchain
[SPEAKER_00]: transaction, you can prove the date of
your file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change one letter in the file,
this whole thing scrambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can also prove that it's not been
mucked with since the date it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not been edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what we call proof of
existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do scan NCBI for other validated data
sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm putting validated and air quotes
here because these were generated with
[SPEAKER_00]: really early technologies before we had
good references.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very rare we get perfect overlaps
because there are DNA sequencing errors in
[SPEAKER_00]: these data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we saw something that was
maybe 78 or 80 out of 81 SNPs that were
[SPEAKER_00]: overlapping in the files, that's probably
a perfect match, but you might need some
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmation sequencing to confirm it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The techniques that were used here,
again, predated people understanding that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a SNP every 50 bases in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they use techniques that would trip
up on those other variants and not always
[SPEAKER_00]: amplify targets out of the genome
accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't expect to get 100% overlap in
concordance with these other techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were operating with earlier
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, OK, with that, we are going to go on
to section two of this tutorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
