[SPEAKER_00]: This study has been submitted and approved
through their IRB.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking specifically for just
really simply two criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, are you an adult?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need 18 or older.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just too much complexity in trying
to get this info from kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can start to uncover more
about pediatrics later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need you to be an adult who either
has been diagnosed with CHS or believes
[SPEAKER_00]: they're suffering with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need you to be diagnosed by a
doctor, but we need you to think this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm pretty sure what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a litany of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each part is going to take about 25
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long time, I do recognize,
but to make it more valuable for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will be entered when you complete the
survey into a raffle for $100 gift card.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're leaning towards Amazon, but not to
brand drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're still figuring out where that's
going to come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we're really excited to drop
this two-part survey to understand both
[SPEAKER_00]: the symptoms and use patterns,
and then also the burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: How hard has this been on you and your
family?
[SPEAKER_00]: What organs did you have removed?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's literally a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did someone cut out your appendix during
the process of trying to discover that all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this inflammation was because your
endocannabinoid system was out of balance
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've been smoking too much
cannabis or marijuana, as they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
I don't know.
