[SPEAKER_02]: Hi everyone, thank you for the people that
are not on the beach now, the few of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in an argument in my faculty a
month ago if it's closing remarks or just
[SPEAKER_02]: the last one that nobody wants really to
hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will call it closing remarks for my own
self-esteem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much to the people that
stay with me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see how this works, like that,
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Dedi Meiri, I'm a professor
at the Technion, the Technology Institute
[SPEAKER_02]: of Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a disclaimer, I'm also owner of
Canasol, which is a company that's doing
[SPEAKER_02]: analytics, but also a lot in the R&D,
and part of the results that I will show
[SPEAKER_02]: you here have been done also in Canasol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis, I think it's stupid to show this
figure here in the last session of the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, and also to say that is a unique
plant that harboring unique molecule
[SPEAKER_02]: called cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's affecting the endocannabinoid system
in our body, but I'm saying that to people
[SPEAKER_02]: that maybe not admire how complicated the
endocannabinoid system, or how complicated
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is, the endocannabinoid system is
a system in our body that every cell in
[SPEAKER_02]: our body harboring the endocannabinoid
system and being affected by
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is 220-some different types of
cells in our body, whether they are
[SPEAKER_02]: neurons, whether these are skin cells or
liver cells, they're all harboring
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors for the endocannabinoid system
and can produce endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the blood samples today, we can analyze
more than 120 different ligand,
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids, and there are more than
30 receptors that we are looking on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the endocannabinoid system,
it's a communication between two cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: One cell sends a signal to another cell,
increase appetite, reduce pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: increase heart beating, modulation of
glucose intake, immune system,
[SPEAKER_02]: immune cells, they're all being controlled
by the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't say any word till now about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a system in our body that control and
balance doing kind of a homoestasis on
[SPEAKER_02]: almost all the cells in our body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis was just totally unlucky to
produce similar molecules to the molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: that our body producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than 10,000 years ago, people started
to breed this plant and to increase the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of these molecules and create kind
of a puppy, kind of a poodle plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a natural plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there is people from Morocco
here that told me you need to come and to
[SPEAKER_02]: see the original plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, 10,000 years ago, people walk with
that, breed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no original.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all been produced by you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans, the cannabis shouldn't produce
more than 0.1, 0.2% of fetocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lumier Hanush, who is here, published a
few years ago about 60-some plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: producing fetocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between them to cannabis is
the amount of fetocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis was breeded and breeded and
breeded and we create a plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: harbored a lot of these molecules in high
percentage people from the 60s can tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you that in Woodstock it was 6% TEC and
not 36% TEC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't do the breeding right,
that's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis, it's not a one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of, I will call the chemovars,
different variation that harboring
[SPEAKER_02]: different combination of these molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my lab, we identified 11% TEC in 11
different families and we can analyze
[SPEAKER_02]: around 166 fetocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big question in this arena,
and this is similar to what I talked last
[SPEAKER_02]: year, but I will take it from a different
angle soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big question is how you match the
right flower to the right indication.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you match the right flower to the
right bride, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If cannabis or the endocannabinoids can
influence pain, sleep, appetite,
[SPEAKER_02]: immune, glucose, so which combination of
molecule, which plant can affect the
[SPEAKER_02]: appetite, which one affecting immune or
which one of them reducing pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: How we are doing that, and I show this
results enough time in cannabis so I will
[SPEAKER_02]: go fast to reach the point that I want to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How we can do that, we can screen on cell
culture, we can take data from patient,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can do many things to define which
cannabis is affecting which indication.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're screening, we can grow cells
on the plate like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can grow cells on the plate that have
many wells.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can have equipment that's screening
very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the lower plate, you can see 96 well
plate that have 96 well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put different types of cannabis,
different dosing, and there is equipment
[SPEAKER_02]: that's screening very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't go on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not important, and these are results
from my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of you already saw that result.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm showing that in the last three years,
so I'm going fast on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how cannabis influence leukemia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that cannabis affecting the immune
cells, so how it's affecting the cancer of
[SPEAKER_02]: the immune cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Elie Best, a PhD in my lab,
take a TLL, which is a specific type,
[SPEAKER_02]: so leukemia, screen on them different
chemo of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see every color, it's a different
chemo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see when the line is lower,
the mean that it's killed more cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see that in two microgram per ml,
most of the cannabis didn't affect the
[SPEAKER_02]: leukemia, but there was one extract that
was very efficient killing the leukemia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because leukemia, it's a given name to
many different diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tested different types of leukemias,
and we saw that in 50% of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: these types of cannabis killed the
leukemia very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 50% of them, it didn't affect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the opposite, what I showed,
50% didn't affect, and 50% is killed very
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we screened these 10 leukemia,
we did the genomic screening, and we find
[SPEAKER_02]: that every time that there is a specific
mutation called notch one, these specific
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis killing the cells when every time
that there is no mutation, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm trying to show you is how
specific it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis can kill cancer, Rick Simpson
oil, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: One type of cannabis from 200 and some
different chemo virus that we test was the
[SPEAKER_02]: only one that affects this leukemia.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that, it's not all the leukemia,
it's just leukemia that's harboring
[SPEAKER_02]: specific mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this notch one is a protein sitting on
the membrane field, the other cells near
[SPEAKER_02]: him, what we call contact inhibition,
doesn't important.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take this specific leukemia,
we create mice model for leukemia.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see a CT of mice with cancer in
his back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're treating these mice with cannabis
with this specific extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the black line on the left,
it's tumors with mice that didn't treat
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis, how the tumor are growing
exponentially, while the gray line is mice
[SPEAKER_02]: that harbored tumors that treated with
this specific cannabis, which the tumors
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the right side, you can see the tumors
before and after three weeks treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is leukemia, we did the bone
marrow implantation with primary cells
[SPEAKER_02]: from patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: We show that we are doubling the lifespan
of the mice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did five different mice model and we
showed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're asking which molecules from the
cannabis doing this effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all the molecules that this
specific extract is harboring.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking this extract, we
fractionated, we taking pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: We said there is 100 molecules that take
25, 25, 25, 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going back to the cells and the mice
and you see that the first line,
[SPEAKER_02]: the vehicle, didn't kill the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole extract, extract number 10,
was very efficient killing the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then fourth fraction and just fraction
number two mimic the whole extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already eliminating 75% of the
molecules that we don't need.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's important here is that in the end,
we succeed to analyze three molecules,
[SPEAKER_02]: just three, that if you take them
synthetic or purified from the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: take the three of them, you get exactly
the same action as the whole extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take any one of them, and this is
the bars in the left low, every one of
[SPEAKER_02]: them, a combination of two of them,
it's not working as good as the three of
[SPEAKER_02]: them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a lot of cell biology and
biochemistry and this paper actually
[SPEAKER_02]: published last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the end, we define exactly the
mechanism of action.
[SPEAKER_02]: These three molecules, CBD, CBDV,
and the new cannabis we call the 3318,
[SPEAKER_02]: binding two different receptors,
CB2 and TRP1, and doing a full action of
[SPEAKER_02]: many proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't get into that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually blocking in the Golgi the
ability of the mutant protein to reach to
[SPEAKER_02]: the membrane.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of biology when most of you are not
scientists and not physicians,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not important to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to say, we understand why we
need three molecules and we understand
[SPEAKER_02]: what they are doing to kill the cells and
why there is mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's killing the cells and when there is
no mutation, it's not killing the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bridging the gap between herbal
medicine, between saying this is a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that's affecting, to real modern science
and modern medicine showing these are the
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules, this is the affinity,
this is the validity, this is what they
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing, this is why you need the three
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But pay attention, we need three of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the drugs that have been approved
by the FDA, it's single molecule to single
[SPEAKER_02]: target.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we are afraid from drug-drug
interaction and more things.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can show with different work that
sometimes we can isolate single molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that slide, we see from breast cancer,
different types of cancer, we isolate
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it 37315.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's similar a little bit to CBG,
but you can say that there is three oxygen
[SPEAKER_02]: there and these molecules reduce the
activity of the estrogen receptor and for
[SPEAKER_02]: that reason, in estrogen receptor,
in breast cancer-dependent estrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor, it can affect the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, not important the breast cancer and
the results, the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, it's one molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not THC, not CBD, not CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can call it minor cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be minor if you're a breast
cancer patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a molecule that reduce the estrogen
and for that, it can affect estrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: but now it's one molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed you that cannabis can affect
cancer in different way, different cancer,
[SPEAKER_02]: different cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it always good?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a different question on drug-drug
interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are these molecules?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know nothing about these molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if it's safe, if it's not
safe, but we asked a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that cannabis modulates the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that it's good for inflammatory
bowel disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that for autoimmune disease,
patients usually have been treated with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and I showed you that it's
affecting T cells in leukemia.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best treatment today in cancer
or the most innovative treatment is in
[SPEAKER_02]: immunotherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Immunotherapy is when we are telling or
teaching the immune cells to attack the
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cancer is doing two things and I will
show a slide in a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's changing the microenvironment near
him and actually changed the immune system
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring cells that are not attacking him,
actually quite supporting him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing two tricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, he's presenting a protein
and said, I'm self.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of the cells from the body don't
attack me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, he produced specific proteins that
exhausting the immune cells to attacking
[SPEAKER_02]: him, make the immune cells weaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: How cannabis affect that?
[SPEAKER_02]: If cannabis reducing, so we giving a
treatment that actually activating the
[SPEAKER_02]: immune system, but cannabis reduce the
immune system activity in inflammatory
[SPEAKER_02]: bowel disease, in autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed you in the leukemia.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look in the literature,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are few publications that show that
patient, these are clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_02]: patient that getting immunotherapy and
cannabis, it's actually improve the
[SPEAKER_02]: activity of the immune therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is beautiful, but if you look,
there are other papers that showing that
[SPEAKER_02]: if you again clinical trials, that if you
give cannabis together with immunotherapy,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's reduce the activity of the
immunotherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My problem with these publication that the
same idiot published all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're sitting far, of course,
I wouldn't say idiot if it wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did four clinical trials with different
results, but this is fit to what I
[SPEAKER_02]: believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is not one plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is many varieties and part of the
varieties can do something and part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties could do something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask ourselves, let's build a model for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take mice, normal mice, and let's
take mice without immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every scientist know that we are using
mice with no immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them nude mice because they don't
have a hair at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking normal mice and nude mice and
we're treating them with, we create them
[SPEAKER_02]: tumors in these mice and we're treating
the normal mice with cannabis and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for strain that reducing the size
of the tumor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same one that succeed here,
we're treating with mice with no immune
[SPEAKER_02]: system and now we want to see which
extract reduce the size in normal mice,
[SPEAKER_02]: but don't affecting the size of the tumor
in mice without immune system and that
[SPEAKER_02]: will tell us that it happened through the
immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We succeed to isolate specific extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: We learn the mechanism of action,
what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We succeed to isolate specific molecules
and doing that effect, we define that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: reducing secretion for the cancer cell of
specific cytokines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go deeper to the result,
but we saw that these molecules affecting
[SPEAKER_02]: the immune activity of the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: We target and we mimic it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did with the full extract and we
see that the single molecule doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: same effect as the whole extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we know that what the cancer cell and
I explained that few minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the cancer cell doing, it doing two
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, he presenting protein cell
himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is me, don't attack me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, he produce specific protein that
affecting the immune cells to be weaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually this protein breaking down amino
acid that is essential for the T cells to
[SPEAKER_02]: attack him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have very good treatments today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we call immunotherapy is it blocking
anti-PDL1, ketruda, whatever you call
[SPEAKER_02]: them, that blocking the ability of the
cell to say, I'm self on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we find out that the cannabis
blocking this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now if you're giving cannabis specific
cannabis with this specific molecule,
[SPEAKER_02]: together with immunotherapy, you get a way
better action than the immunotherapy alone
[SPEAKER_02]: on the cannabis alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is the message here?
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not enough to say to a cancer patient
that getting immunotherapy take cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which type of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: What molecules?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be on that side or it can be on
that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is a complicate plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all the plants are complicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to say in one of my talk previous
like seven years ago, cannabis is not like
[SPEAKER_02]: a tobacco that have nicotine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a lot of molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I met a guy from Philip Morris that
tell me, oh you know cannabis is a simple
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is more than 1500 active compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I stop saying that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the plants are complicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we are going to the grocery store and
buy apples, we know that the green one
[SPEAKER_02]: called Smith, they are very sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red one called Macintosh, they are
sweeter and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that apples are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Israelis have something very unique to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have super power when we knock on
watermelon, we know if it's sweet or no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every Israeli when you're buying a
watermelon, if you travel in Israel,
[SPEAKER_02]: you see this phenomena.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm serious, we're knocking on the
watermelon to know if it's sweet or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like three Israelis here that can
approve me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every Israeli know that every
watermelon is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we're going to herbal medicine,
we flatten that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if it's cannabis,
it can be archinicea, valeriana,
[SPEAKER_02]: ginkgo, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Archinicea good for the immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ginkgo good for that, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of them the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter where it's growing,
we have the same molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, it's the same story as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're talking about today on
psilocybin mushroom or magic mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of them are the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are more than 20 families,
hundreds of species, many active compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: called tryptamine, the same story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this leading me to what we called the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Entourage effect is mainly saying in
cannabis or other plants, there are many
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds that doing something
complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think in cannabis, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are three layers of the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, let's start, what is the
entourage effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ravi Mishula and Professor Ben Shabbat
published in 1998 a paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lume, I'm not sure if you were there or
not, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So published a paper called an entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: After these three words, try to read it,
it will be difficult to all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inactive endogenous fancies, acid
glycerol, ester, enhance to a hedonic
[SPEAKER_02]: glycerol cannabinoid activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of you remember that, you remember
the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually it wasn't about cannabis,
it was about endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he showed the two endocannabines,
two linole glycine or two palmetto
[SPEAKER_02]: glycine, which not binding CB1 enhancing
other endocannabinoids to AG to bind the
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he called it the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Ethan, you weren't the one that
took it, no?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so Ethan here is saying that the
next year they send another paper saying
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's also applying for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the first one was this one,
okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the entourage effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, I showed you,
for examples in the leukemia, that you
[SPEAKER_02]: need three molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the meaning of these three
molecules?
[SPEAKER_02]: When three molecules activate on the same
cell, different receptors, we actually
[SPEAKER_02]: call it polypharmacology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's when you're treating a disease by
modulation, one target you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: activity which is more complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I showed that in the leukemia example,
how three molecules binding different
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors, opening calcium channels,
I didn't show the mechanism of action,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're doing something synergistic in
the plant, in the cell, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting the same plant, the same cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about it, plant are
harboring polypharmacology within.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you think about a physician
10,000 years ago, 5,000 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you come with a kind of inflammation,
it will take a root from here,
[SPEAKER_02]: a flower from here, a stem from here,
combine them together, and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: creating polypharmacology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think polypharmacology will grow and
be bigger and bigger in treatment,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also I think the FDA will start to
approve more and more, this is my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're changing in the last 20
years our analytical ability to analyze
[SPEAKER_02]: these molecules but more than that,
to use computers to understand networking
[SPEAKER_02]: and pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look about network of three
molecules, five molecules, if in the past
[SPEAKER_02]: it was complicated to understand that
today with computer analysis, it's quite
[SPEAKER_02]: to understand and to see what is the
drug-drug interaction and modeling and
[SPEAKER_02]: things that will open that gate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is, for me, the first layer of
the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Few molecules that affecting one cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second layer of the entourage effect
is that we have molecules that affecting
[SPEAKER_02]: different cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will take, for example, IBD,
inflammatory bowel disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inflammatory bowel disease consists mainly
two types of cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the colon cells that being somehow
harm, mainly probably bacteria or
[SPEAKER_02]: microenvironment, whatever, but they're
being harm, they're secreting specific
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules, so-called cytokines,
calling other types of cells, the immune
[SPEAKER_02]: cells, to come and to help them,
but actually we're creating chronic
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammation that cause this disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's two types of cells, two systems,
the colon cells and the immune cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in two different studies, two different
PhD students in my lab, one of them walk
[SPEAKER_02]: on the colon sense and define specific
combination of cannabinoids, actually two,
[SPEAKER_02]: that reduce the ability of the colon cells
to secrete these cytokines to call the
[SPEAKER_02]: immune cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the same extract, different
student, different PhD work, work on the
[SPEAKER_02]: immune cells and show that different
molecules from the same extract actually
[SPEAKER_02]: blocking the ability of the immune cells
to migrate towards the colon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different compound, different results
Okay, the first one, if people are here,
[SPEAKER_02]: are physician or scientist, the first one
reducing specific protein called STAT3,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is creating the inflammation or the
release of cytokines.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one, reducing protein called
CXCO4, which actually it's kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: antenna.
[SPEAKER_02]: The colon cells secreting the molecules
that reaching the immune cells,
[SPEAKER_02]: binding them, and then binding a specific
protein called CXCO4, which feel now where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's binding, bind here, here and here,
and started to migrate towards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cannabis, for one hand,
one molecule from this extract reducing
[SPEAKER_02]: the colon cells to secrete these
molecules, different molecules blocking
[SPEAKER_02]: the ability of the cells to feel it and to
migrate, and you're getting entourage
[SPEAKER_02]: effect, you're getting synergism,
you're getting powerful reaction that if
[SPEAKER_02]: you take just with molecule that affecting
the colon or just these molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting the immune system, you won't get
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a different layer,
more complicated for me, for the FDA or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, it will be two
treatment that we need to combine or we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to use the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a different layer of the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third layer of the entourage effect or
third entourage, it's when we are not
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about single indication,
but we are talking about the quality of
[SPEAKER_02]: life of the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are talking about the whole patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we take pain patient, we did the
clinical trial of 3,800 pain patient and
[SPEAKER_02]: we measure many parameter of the patient,
even though the patient, 50% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: patients said the cannabis is really help
them change their life, did a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we measured the pain, we saw that it
still didn't reduce much of the pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: less than 30% reduced two point in the
pain of the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you started to check why this
patient said that it's really help them,
[SPEAKER_02]: we saw that it's really also reduce
anxiety, reduce depression, improve sleep,
[SPEAKER_02]: improve appetite, and when you measure
quality of life action, what we call
[SPEAKER_02]: catastrophism, how the patient conceived
his disease, then we saw a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the cannabis improved the
quality of life of the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you think about that, few molecules
affect the pain, few molecules affect
[SPEAKER_02]: appetite, few molecules affect anxiety,
few molecules affect sleep, and all
[SPEAKER_02]: together, the patient improve his quality
of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is cannabis because it's
affecting so many systems in all of the
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is doing moderate action,
a little bit on the pain, a little bit on
[SPEAKER_02]: the sleep, a little bit on the appetite,
you're getting something as a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment, which is better, and you
wouldn't get it from single molecule,
[SPEAKER_02]: single treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to give peel for sleep,
peel for pain, peel for appetite,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis gives something more holistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we think about that, cannabis is
kind of an orchestra of molecules that
[SPEAKER_02]: working on a system called the
endocannabinoid system, mimicking things
[SPEAKER_02]: in our body, we can narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't prepare my talk until two
hours ago, and I prepared it because
[SPEAKER_02]: things that I heard during this
conference, there are kind of division
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that coming from pharma and looking
for, let's take single molecules or they
[SPEAKER_02]: and then purified them, then go with that,
and people that believe more in the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and looking about the entourage effect,
but actually what I'm trying to show that
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody is wrong here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In few indication, if you're looking very
specific, you want to treat something very
[SPEAKER_02]: specific, you can isolate the molecule and
go pharma route, and there is indication
[SPEAKER_02]: that this might work.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be more complicated,
more risky on the business side,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can say, okay, I will take these two
molecules that affecting the colon,
[SPEAKER_02]: these two molecules that affecting the
immune cells, I will try to combine them
[SPEAKER_02]: to botanic treatment or to be very,
very brave and to try to go with this to
[SPEAKER_02]: the FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still, I believe in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third one is to say when you want
to treat quality of life of the patient,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the most, it's the majority of
our patient, you can't run away from the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want a consistently a product,
something safe, something that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what you get, but you won't get away from
the plant because it's too complicated and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's doing too many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the future will consist part of
these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we will see more and more drugs
that FDA approved single molecules,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 3315, that they write a patent
and somebody license it and go with that
[SPEAKER_02]: to reduce estrogen, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see drugs like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see the whole plant as medicines
for many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we can run away from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Countries like Israel, 150,000
prescription in months for patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most prescribed medicine in
Israel, but this is the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do believe that we will see a new
route, a new path of more complicated
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs that trying to affect not one
mechanism, not one system, but more of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's, you know, you need to
break a wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to be innovative.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do believe that there are diseases
like ALS Alzheimer, types of cancer that
[SPEAKER_02]: we hit our head to the wall many years and
don't succeed to solve them with a
[SPEAKER_02]: simplified activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we will understand the complexity
and we try to do complicated things,
[SPEAKER_02]: we might bring a cure to these ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: By that, I want to say thanks a lot to the
amazing team that working.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shrink.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was before the Corona.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shrink a lot from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are my students and my workers
that are doing the amazing work that I
[SPEAKER_02]: showed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Daddy, for this
wonderful presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to say that you left me a
little bit confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the future hold for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see cannabis being developed to do
to be a pharmaceutical drug or rather it
[SPEAKER_01]: might just or not just, but it might stay
as a herbal extract or product?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it depends on the indication.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, and my father taught me
that if I argue with somebody,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 50 percent wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, actually would say if you argue with
your mother, it's 100 percent wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't argue.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what he used to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's my opinion and just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that in specific indication and
mainly save lives indication, it will be
[SPEAKER_02]: more precise, more firm around these
molecules for leukemia or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in an indication which is more
related to quality of life, which more
[SPEAKER_02]: wide will stay with the with the plant for
two reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, it's a cheap medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is there is a reason why,
you know, in the global world,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just came from India yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually fly from India here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned that Miami is not on the way
from India, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are countries like India that cheap
medicine is extremely important and think
[SPEAKER_02]: there is cannabis is a cheap medicine and
state like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in the complicated thing in
the, you know, quality of life,
[SPEAKER_02]: things that you're treating many,
it will stay with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to precise it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to to know which extract or which
plane to use to what.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it will stay with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just like to to comment that it
might there might be some difficulties in
[SPEAKER_01]: this approach, since once you define the
certain substance, certain molecule as a
[SPEAKER_01]: drug, then it comes to be under
regulation, which might not support public
[SPEAKER_01]: use for different purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, you know, the cannabis is very
unique because there is regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each country looks in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just came from India that they have
regulation for plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have plants as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I forgot how would they call it every
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet I bet that OK, it's a specific
regulation for plant, which we don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: in the, you know, in the state or in
Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very depend on the regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is this problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: One.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daddy, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That overview is so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question about the so-called minor
cannabinoids that you've been testing,
[SPEAKER_03]: are they much more potent than the major
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to amplify their concentration or
dose that you're giving in these models,
[SPEAKER_03]: or do you give them in relatively tiny
doses like they occur in the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's specific for each minor cannabinoids
that we define.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, there are minor cannabinoids that we
found that which are extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more like three three one eight in the
leukemia is very similar to CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you increase the amount, it's more
potent to the city from the CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you tried it on epilepsy,
it's working even better than the CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and very similar action to the speedy,
but something else there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other fetal cannabinoids that I
think their potency is lower, but there
[SPEAKER_02]: are potent like the minor can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there are many minor
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The minor cannabinoids that we found that
active, they were very potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one that I showed the estrogen,
because you have three oxygens on the
[SPEAKER_02]: outside, its viability is way higher than
the regular fetal cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might be why it's more potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the result, but yeah,
they're potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Daddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for a great lecture.
[SPEAKER_04]: As usual, I have a question going back to
the slide where you showed the cancer cell
[SPEAKER_04]: having two actions, one saying I'm self
don't kill me and that you're saying that
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the when the anti PD one comes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not is this new information that
you're sharing that with you set a new
[SPEAKER_04]: paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not where cannabis is causing an
issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's causing an issue more on the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the micro environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the cannabis is what we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, but the cannabis, this cannabinoid is
affecting the cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, is reducing the secretion
of specific cytokine called CSF one and
[SPEAKER_02]: CSF one changing the cancer cell secretes
the fund to change the profile of the
[SPEAKER_02]: macrophages arriving the micro environment
in two instead of in one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually there are macrophages that
coming in, deactivating the T cells,
[SPEAKER_02]: changing the profile of that, changing the
activity of the T cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second, it's reducing the activity of
two enzymes, Inos and Arginaz,
[SPEAKER_02]: which break down Arginine, which that the
way to do what we call immunosuppressive
[SPEAKER_02]: blocking that blocking the ability of the
cancer cell to immunosuppress the T cells
[SPEAKER_02]: activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so so if we take tumors and we did
that, you take tumors from patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: you grow them in a plate, you treat them
with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and then you taking the supernatant
like they're like, you know, the what they
[SPEAKER_02]: secreted and put on T cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that if you're not doing that,
it's inhibiting the T cells activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you treat with cannabis,
it's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inhibit the T cells activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like classing method to test it.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so I have a follow up question.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's OK if you don't want to answer me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just today, I got a text message from the
mother of a boy I've already emailed you
[SPEAKER_04]: about once.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you remember is a 10 year
old with metastatic osteosarcoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: His second cancer is treated for leukemia
as a young child and has a subsequent
[SPEAKER_04]: secondary cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was on cannabis and chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: His physicians decided to switch him to
Navoma lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I discontinued the cannabis and she
texted me today to say, is there any way
[SPEAKER_04]: we can add it back?
[SPEAKER_04]: He has the most horrific side effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I wrote back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's anything safe,
but I'll see Dr. Meary and ask him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know I'm putting you on the spot to
translate to a cancer patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always difficult for me to answer
that the clinical trial that we showed
[SPEAKER_02]: that was reduced the activity of the
immune cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: The immunotherapy was on the drug,
specific drug, and we saw that in general,
[SPEAKER_02]: the success rate reduced from 40 few
percent to 20 few percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really affecting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was high THC strain classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The strain that we used here in this study
is high CBG strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's totally different profile,
totally different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in Israel, I'm working with all
the head of the oncology department in the
[SPEAKER_02]: main hospitals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a panel of all the head of the
oncologists and me about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer was, you know, there is
risk, you know, we won't take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the frame that they gave
immunotherapy, that's stopping the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think, according to our results,
that the high CBG strain today that are
[SPEAKER_02]: available outside are safe enough,
and I don't see this reaction from the
[SPEAKER_02]: patient and from the pre-clinicals that we
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not sure that these strains are
effective on the side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if the high CBG strain are
really reducing nausea or pain or that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the effect on the side
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is risk to give cannabis with
immunotherapy if it's just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, it depends on the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a nice, helpful answer,
because if he's terribly desperate and
[SPEAKER_04]: he's not finding any relief, I would
probably feel a little more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can try CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, the cannabinoids that they
showed in the immunotherapy work was CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a minor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't call it CBG minor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a comment, Bonnie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a tough question, but then you
have to weigh the other side is that can
[SPEAKER_03]: this kid complete the course of therapy
without the help of cannabis, or are they
[SPEAKER_03]: going to have to throw in the telon
immunotherapy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to comment on a couple of
things from your previous slide regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: the approach moving forward as far as
investigating this further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Groupers versus splitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that tend to want to treat it
holistically versus those that want to
[SPEAKER_00]: pinpoint specific parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if there's a middle ground
regarding this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And considering that there are different
strains, just like your apple slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: could it not be more a way of approaching
it in understanding that our categories,
[SPEAKER_00]: neuromuscular, neurological, GI,
pain, inflammation as specific areas to
[SPEAKER_00]: address rather than getting specific
conditions or illnesses rather grouping
[SPEAKER_00]: them in certain generalities that we can
pinpoint and direct treatment plans for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel that rather than, again,
segregating the plant and cutting it up in
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller pieces, why not just develop
certain specific medical strains towards
[SPEAKER_00]: that grouping and see and investigate that
very question of entourage and how mental
[SPEAKER_00]: health affects all that and how the mental
health, if improved, can improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical condition?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will answer that in two ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, it's, you know, some of the
truth is not denied there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a cell biologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm interested in what the molecule
doing in the cell in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not the cannabis, you know,
regulator or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to answer that, the technology is
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we can analyze the compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can say this is the profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the groups that are doing for that
and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technology are for there, but the
knowledge is not for there, not there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have the knowledge to say in
all the indication, not even in minor
[SPEAKER_02]: indications to say this is the profile
that you need for that or this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: profile to group that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't have the knowledge yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I showed few things that we
have results, but in most of the things we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm responsible for courses
in Israel for physician or for nurses and
[SPEAKER_02]: for, and then people said, yeah,
education is very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to teach them what I know to teach
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to teach them,
but I'm showing the entourage,
[SPEAKER_02]: the endocannabinoid system there,
but I don't know to tell them what to
[SPEAKER_02]: prescribe, which one is really good for
that or for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to have a knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have this profile at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technology is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I must say that very few scientists in the
world, I'm not talking about companies or
[SPEAKER_02]: them, I'm talking about even scientists,
taking the approach to really go deep and
[SPEAKER_02]: to look on the minor cannabinoids and the
combination, you know, who's sitting here
[SPEAKER_02]: and other scientists doing that,
but these are, I can count them on one
[SPEAKER_02]: hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't have this data, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have the data to push it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much and have a good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
