[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very happy and honored to be here
today to speak to you about an
[SPEAKER_00]: observational study I'm doing looking at
the effects of cannabinoids on seizures in
[SPEAKER_00]: adults with medically refractory epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to do first is go through a
little bit of background information and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I am going to show you some
preliminary data which essentially shows
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects that seizures have on
autonomic nervous system and the effects
of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is coming from a precannabinoid
baseline period for my participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So epilepsy is a central nervous system
disorder characterized by abnormal
[SPEAKER_00]: neuronal activity and seizures signs and
symptoms of seizures include everything
[SPEAKER_00]: from a staring spell to convulsions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seizures also produce autonomic symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like pallor and sweating and
pilo erection and in fact autonomic
[SPEAKER_00]: changes may be among the most common and
least recognized symptoms of seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seizures are typically classified as being
either focal or generalized depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: where the abnormal brain activity begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focal seizures can also become generalized
and people can have multiple types of
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures and seizures can occur with or
without a loss of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both focal and generalized seizures can
alter autonomic nervous system function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The probable path is through the limbic
system and if there is seizure activation
[SPEAKER_00]: or inhibition of the autonomic network it
can result in effects on all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: systems that you see listed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So despite the availability of all
different kinds of anti epileptic drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: for about 30 percent of people with
epileptic epilepsy their seizures are not
[SPEAKER_00]: well controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a condition that's called
medically refractory epilepsy and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with severe morbidity and also
increased mortality in the form of a
[SPEAKER_00]: condition that's called SUDEP which stands
for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gap in treatment that exists is
what has led people to seek alternatives
[SPEAKER_00]: such as cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endo cannabinoid system makes sense
both as a potential site of impairment in
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy and also as a potential target
for treatment in epilepsy and that has
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly to do with its role in the
regulation of synaptic activity and also
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all different types of studies
using a whole variety of different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoids which point to the
potential usefulness of cannabinoids as a
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment for epilepsy including the two
recent randomized control trials which
[SPEAKER_00]: showed that Epidiolex was effective in
decreasing seizure frequency in children
[SPEAKER_00]: with two really severe forms of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have many studies that have
pointed to cannabinoids as being
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially useful in epilepsy and the
types of cannabinoids being used are TBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of TBD and THC and even whole
plant products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately recommendations about the
specific cannabinoid types and dosing and
[SPEAKER_00]: routes of administration etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: are lacking particularly for adults and so
not everybody has a Dr. Goldstein
[SPEAKER_00]: available to them unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so adults are basically sort of taking
their treatments into their own hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads me to my study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The study that I'm doing is an
observational study of the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids on seizures in adults with
medically refractory epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a within subjects design where we
are following participants for one month
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to their initiating the use of
cannabinoids and then for five months
[SPEAKER_00]: after they begin using cannabinoids and I
have to note though that no cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: are provided to the participants of this
study by the researchers and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's an observational study
legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I can do is observe what
these people are doing to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact participants support for medicinal
cannabis use is provided by the realm of
[SPEAKER_00]: caring and you will be hearing from
Heather Jackson in just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main objectives I have for this
study are to characterize the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids on seizures in adults with
medically refractory epilepsy using both
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological and behavioral measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also have a very important second
objective which is basically to enhance
[SPEAKER_00]: our understanding of medically refractory
epilepsy in general as well as the effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoid use through the daily
wireless recording of participants
[SPEAKER_00]: autonomic physiology using a device called
the E4 wristband which is produced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: company Empatica.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main outcome measures I have for this
study are seizure frequency quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: life and I also have a particular interest
and hypothesis around electrodermal
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the inclusion and exclusion
criteria for my study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are pretty standard for people with
medically refractory epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highlight by the Colorado resident is
there because I recently received IRB
[SPEAKER_00]: approval to extend the study to people who
are residing in states where cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: legal for the treatment of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing that we are looking for is
that people have not used cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: within the last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the six months course of the study
participants make three visits to the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: or I make three visits to their home and
at each of these visits participants fill
[SPEAKER_00]: out a whole battery of standardized
questionnaires and they also provide us
[SPEAKER_00]: with urine samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about a month after visit one
participants are free to begin using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a list of the behavioral
questionnaires that we give to people at
[SPEAKER_00]: each of those visits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a list of the cannabinoids and
metabolites that are being tested for in
[SPEAKER_00]: participants urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brings me finally to the E4
wristband.
[SPEAKER_00]: The E4 is the device that we are using for
daily wireless physiological recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was made or developed by Rosalind
Picard and her colleagues at the Media Lab
[SPEAKER_00]: at MIT and it records a whole bunch of
different autonomic variables which you
[SPEAKER_00]: see listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also includes an event marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And participants in this study are
instructed to press the event marker once
[SPEAKER_00]: if they have a seizure if they're able and
then twice when they use cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have again the electrodermal
activity highlighted there because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a variable that's of particular interest
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electrodermal activity is basically
sweating activity that's elicited by
[SPEAKER_00]: activation of the sympathetic nervous
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to developing the E4 Dr.
Picard and her group also developed an
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm for seizure detection that's
based on the variables that the E4
[SPEAKER_00]: collects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they published a study where they
found for example that electrodermal
[SPEAKER_00]: activity plus motion is better than motion
alone for automated grand mal generalized
[SPEAKER_00]: tonic clonic seizure detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empatica is actually pretty producing
seizure reports for this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this group has also made a number of
other important contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example in a case study they
demonstrated that a signature of a GTCS
[SPEAKER_00]: seizure in EEG was associated with a spike
in electrodermal activity that's measured
[SPEAKER_00]: at the wrist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have also done some other work which
essentially points to autonomic
[SPEAKER_00]: dysfunction as being a potential
contributing factor to suit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had a whole number of people
contact me that are interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: participating in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them have had to be excluded or
not enrolled because they don't meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: study criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently I have four participants
enrolled in the study and here is some
[SPEAKER_00]: background information on those
participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four are male and one is female.
[SPEAKER_00]: All four of the participants have focal
complex seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: For three of these participants those can
progress to GTCS seizures and two of these
[SPEAKER_00]: participants actually have VNS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could share more about the
participants in the study because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: really truly amazing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to do is show you some data
from each of these four participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first two participants I'm going
to show you are actually under the care of
[SPEAKER_00]: the epileptologist on my research team.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Dr. Doshi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to go ahead and show you
that data some of which he is reviewing
[SPEAKER_00]: with me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first up is participant one five eight
zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're looking at here is an E4
recording that lasts for approximately 16
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top trace is electrodermal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dermal activity followed by blood volume
pulse motion acceleration heart rate and
[SPEAKER_00]: then temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of things that I want
to point out to you on this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first is that at about 430 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: on this day Empatica detects a seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that autonomically this is
associated with a spike in movement
[SPEAKER_00]: activity as well as a spike or some
erratic heart activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next what you can see is that there is a
red line through the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this indicates that a caregiver
pressed the event marker indicating that
[SPEAKER_00]: they also identified the seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So following those spikes in activity you
see sort of a quiet period which is likely
[SPEAKER_00]: a recovery period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about 630 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: or so the participant seems to kind of
resume their normal daily activities until
[SPEAKER_00]: about 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see in the data there that's
circled is an artifact that's due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: participant taking off his E4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And leaving it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ultimately puts it back on and it looks
like he probably goes to sleep maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: around 1030 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it turns out that these event
markers are really incredibly important
[SPEAKER_00]: for the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because it allows me one to
verify the seizure that was detected by
[SPEAKER_00]: Empatica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows me to see what's going on
autonomically for the person when they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also gives me a little bit of
insight into what the algorithm developed
[SPEAKER_00]: by Empatica might be picking up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's unfortunate is that I don't often
see many of these marks in the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because most of my participants
are not aware of when they've had a
[SPEAKER_00]: seizure and caregivers can't necessarily
catch everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a file from that same participant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular file lasts about 42 hours
long and you can see that right about one
[SPEAKER_00]: o 'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empatica detected a seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again it seems to have that pattern where
there's a spike in the movement activity
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as a spike in the heart activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular seizure was also marked by
a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again after the seizure you can see
sort of that that quiet potential recovery
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Empatica also detected two
additional seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those seizures the pattern is not
quite as clear as the pattern in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous files that I've shown you and
neither of these was marked by a
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for context what you're looking at
here is a plot of the mean and the median
[SPEAKER_00]: electrodermal values across all of the
recordings that I have for this
[SPEAKER_00]: participant at least at the time I made
the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overlaid with this are those orange
circles and those are indications of a
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver pressing the invent marker to
mark for a seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two that are circled are the two that
I showed in the previous files.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately at this point I'm not really
seeing anything consistent in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between electrodermal
activity and seizure activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up is participants 1 4 8 E.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a 28 year old man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recording that you're looking at is
about 26 hours long and it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: unremarkable until the very end when a
seizure was detected and was also reported
[SPEAKER_00]: by the caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's unfortunate is that when the
caregiver detected the seizure she pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: the event marker so hard that she actually
turned off the the wristband.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just the nature of working with
human subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here what you're seeing is a blow
up of the last two hours of that recording
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can see what's going on
autonomically a little bit more clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again you see a spike in the movement
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see a spike in the heart
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this particular case you can see a
little bit of a dip in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a peak in the electrodermal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next you're looking at data from the same
participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this participants you can see that
around 8 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empatica detected a seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry this is a new new participant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 34 year old female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is her file.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 24 hours long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again at about 8 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empatica detected a seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequently the seizure was also reported
by the caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular case the data does not
fit necessarily the pattern that I showed
[SPEAKER_00]: you previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be the case because this
particular person has more of an absence
[SPEAKER_00]: type seizure than a generalized tonic
clonic seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a file from her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case the caregiver reported
the seizure but nothing was detected by
[SPEAKER_00]: Empatica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again for context you're looking
at the mean and median electrodermal
[SPEAKER_00]: values over all of the recordings that I
have for this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The asterisks are marking the time frames
when seizures were detected and the two
[SPEAKER_00]: that are circled are the ones that I
showed you one where Empatica did detect
[SPEAKER_00]: and one where they did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see other tags in the data
which are these blue circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those tags are indicative of time
frames when the person is taking CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have moved out of their baseline
period into the time frame where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be extremely useful both
in the short and the long term to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: see how CBD is affecting people
autonomically and also affecting seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least this is
participant 1 1 9 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a 42 year old male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recording you're looking at is about
27 hours long.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this time frame Empatica detected
two seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second seizure in particular seems
really close in pattern to some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures I showed you previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one looks similar as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens to occur that that
recovery period happens to occur during a
[SPEAKER_00]: time frame when the person would normally
be asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can tell you that Empatica has
reported many more seizures than are being
[SPEAKER_00]: marked by these participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it may well be that they're having
more seizures than the participants or
[SPEAKER_00]: their caregivers are aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things I'm doing is working
with Dr. Doshi and Empatica to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that our seizure verification is as
accurate as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we hope to learn is overarching what
we hope to learn is whether cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: use is beneficial for adults with MRE.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to learn whether it affects
seizure frequency by looking at those
[SPEAKER_00]: three things that you see here and also
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a particular interest in EDA and
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward with the next 30
participants what I'm going to do to
[SPEAKER_00]: address some of these issues is when
possible verify the seizures using video
[SPEAKER_00]: EEG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to send some control data
through Empatica to get a report on the
[SPEAKER_00]: false positives and try to motivate
caregivers to keep really consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed seizure records and connect more
frequently with participants and
[SPEAKER_00]: caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give it up for Barbara.
