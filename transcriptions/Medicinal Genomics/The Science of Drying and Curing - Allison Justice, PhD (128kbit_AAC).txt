[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to shift gears and take it
from the human and go back to the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk about what we've seen,
what we're going to work on with drying
[SPEAKER_01]: and curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to give you a little bit of my
background and just an idea of where I
[SPEAKER_01]: come from and where some of this research
comes from, I grew up in South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to grow hemp there,
but no cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: After grad school, went to San Diego,
worked there for about three and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: years in the medical industry,
and then bounced back to my home state,
[SPEAKER_01]: South Carolina, where now we grow hemp,
large scale production of liners,
[SPEAKER_01]: so clones, lots and lots and lots of other
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're vertically integrated, so we do a
little bit of everything, but my passion
[SPEAKER_01]: always goes back to the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll talk about the research group
we've formed later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, that's where my passion is,
and that's where this data comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So drying and curing, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was asking this question back in 2016
when I was in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the answer then was a lot of,
I don't know, but I think da-da-da-da.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the answer mostly is still I
think, but da-da-da-da.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a few answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the last speaker was saying,
one good study just makes you have more
[SPEAKER_01]: questions and more things to figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a bite of where hopefully,
you know, we'll be a long run,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots and lots of answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you think about a quality
smokeable flower, because that's what this
[SPEAKER_01]: talk is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not about extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the flower, you know,
no matter where it's grown, harvesting and
[SPEAKER_01]: having it do something else in another
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like anything, you know, it's not just
about, you know, the second it goes into
[SPEAKER_01]: the dry room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want a quality product,
you have to start well from the get-go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you need disease and insect-free
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to harvest delicately because
you'll knock the trichomes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go into drying and curing,
which is all a part of a path to a
[SPEAKER_01]: high-quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, why do we care about
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we care about, you know,
we grew a beautiful plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does that matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to some extent, you know,
this is for preserving a color.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you dry fast or if you dry improperly,
you might turn a really nice green flower
[SPEAKER_01]: to brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may handle it roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you're beating the trichomes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, again, the flower may turn brown,
maybe for a different reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wanting to preserve the smell,
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to preserve those and the other
secondary metabolites that lend to that
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about smokeable flower,
you know, you want it to be a smooth
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one key part that we just do not
quite understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is it that's happening when
you put the flower in a bucket that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to make it a smooth smoke or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, potency is not necessarily
affected by, as far as cannabinoids go,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not affected by the drying and
curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, of course, really rough handling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You knock trichomes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are, in fact, reducing potency just
because of that mechanical damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I come from the ornamental
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did a lot of work in post-harvest of
unrooted cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, shipping them all over the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we would look at,
you know, how do you ship them properly?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you need to take away?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the ethylene gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gas that builds up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you think about bananas,
you know, you take the ethylene away if
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want them to ripen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add ethylene if you want them to
ripen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, how does that apply to
buds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're not keeping the plant
alive, which you're wanting to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: rooted cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you think about cut flowers,
you're not necessarily wanting to save the
[SPEAKER_01]: cut flowers to have roots, but you want to
prolong them where they're pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, research for these sorts
of things have been happening for a long,
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we try to combine the
research that's there on those flowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and figure out how can we apply
this to cannabis and figure out what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in the drying of curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that kind of gives us our paths of
what we need to explore, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, a couple words I want you to know
and understand going through this talk,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're important.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, if we think about
transpiration, that's basically just the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant losing water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this could be another natural
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be because of really,
it's really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it happens at different speeds,
but basically, in short, you're thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: of the water coming through the roots up
the plant, which is how a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients are translocated up through the
plant and then out the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so if you cut the roots off of
a plant, if you have a bud, it can still
[SPEAKER_01]: transpire, but it's not going to take up
more because it doesn't have roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and then respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is pretty much photosynthesis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant takes in oxygen and spits out
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes in carbon dioxide and gives us
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, what this is, is the plant
making use of those ions or those photons
[SPEAKER_01]: in the sky and turning it to sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's important to
remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know some of the next slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so the harvest part's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say it's the least complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can harvest the full plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can break off limbs and harvest
individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even harvest the buds and dry them
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think the biggest takeaway
here is, you know, be delicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in hemp, like you see in this
picture, you're not delicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not care how they look.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just extracting for, for
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are going for smokable flower,
you know, not throwing them on top of each
[SPEAKER_01]: other, really removing those trichomes
because that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show you on a slide later how
important that is, something until
[SPEAKER_01]: recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize how significant trichome
loss is to potency reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other big thing a cultivator would
want to think about, and that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: matters, is leaf removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you have a drying facility that,
you know, is struggling to keep up as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as reducing humidity, you know,
one easy thing you can do is just remove
[SPEAKER_01]: more of the leaves prior to putting in it
to the dry room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, less, less physical material to
actually have to dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so why do we dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of course, number one is this is
how we preserve the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how, you know, think about raisins
or coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all food products have to be
have to have the water removed in order
[SPEAKER_01]: for it not to spoil, to rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, back in 2016 when I joined the
industry, and actually today it is a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty decent indicator, but, you know,
when I would ask, well, how do we figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out when dry is dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is that factor?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would say, well, you snap,
the stem snap, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought was outrageous at the time,
but now it kind of, it correlates pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the data we've took to back that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's kind of cool to see over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the two common methods are water
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's getting more and more
popular, which is what the food industry
[SPEAKER_01]: uses, and then moisture content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those do correlate pretty well
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, water activity is super
important because it's not just the water
[SPEAKER_01]: that's there and in the cells,
it's the water that those microbes could
[SPEAKER_01]: physically grow on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, once you get down to a certain water
activity, you know, you may have spores or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot still there present, but they're
not going to continue to grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: periphery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here's just a quick example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said, other food
industries make use of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very well known where it needs to be
for certain things not to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some solid ideas for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think more so on the how it looks and
consumer preference, not necessarily how
[SPEAKER_01]: it correlates with microbial growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to come out where we
have a standard of it has to be at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if it's bone dry, we know we're
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, cannabis is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's big and it's got different
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a, you know, a flat piece of
dry dried fruit, let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is a graph I found quite a few
years ago and this is kind of what really
[SPEAKER_01]: got my brain spinning of what's happening
in curing specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you look at the bottom
axis, you've got your water activity and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you have all the other reactions that
are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just in plants in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: At these different water activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, one being straight off
the plant, you know, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have the capability to feed
those microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you have a much higher chance of the
higher water activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you go down, you have a better chance
of not having continual growth of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you're still getting some of this
enzymatic activity that's happening that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're contributing to this
change, this improvement in curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, you have,
well, it's not always, it doesn't always
[SPEAKER_01]: match what the consumer wants and what
science wants per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, then you have to include that,
all right, well, is this too dry for the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this too wet for the consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, throwing that into the race as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, once you get to a
certain drying point, that enzymatic
[SPEAKER_01]: activity stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this is kind of the big
picture of what to investigate,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to investigate, and how it's shaped
around water loss basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I made this a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned a lot since then,
but it's still a rough guide, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, step one, you harvest your plants and
you want to get out water as quickly as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: To stop microbial growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a tricky balance because if
you're drying fast, it may be harsher
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, meaning you're losing your
terpenes that you want to save.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, in order to not have a ruined crop,
you know, very fast getting down to that
[SPEAKER_01]: water activity where at least botrytis is
not going to grow anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holding on to a higher water activity
level for those enzymatic activities to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, drying it low enough
to be at the consumer preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is just a rough guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still tons of work to add to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, this is what we're looking at for
food safety purposes really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, what is drying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically the same thing we do for
living plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've got our humidity that we
want to reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our temperature that we should
reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, the easier thing to do is to combine
those two things basically and look at it
[SPEAKER_01]: as the vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you've got the green,
you've got your bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think about high humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the plant is going to lose the
terpenes in the water slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's trying to homogenize to its
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lower humidity, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, then you throw the variable of
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to that, it changes it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I know a few large growers
actually are monitoring their dry room by
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I think it definitely will become
more and more popular over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, just as a, you know, in case you
aren't a cultivator, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the norm, what you shoot for is really
60-60.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, 60% humidity, 60 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, pretty cool temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this is part from the study we did
with the Cannabis Research Coalition
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at, well, how can we take those
two variables as well as adding time and
[SPEAKER_01]: see how long does it take to dry at
different temperatures and relative
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we graphed this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, very relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, this data in a whole allows us to
shape a creation of a VPD chart that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a grower, you've probably seen this
for your grow room where there's an area
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to stay in for VPD in order for
the plant to lose the moisture or not lose
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture, I guess we could put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, it's a little different because these
don't have roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not putting it in a condition to
continually grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting it in a condition to dry the
way we want it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, obviously, you know, you're getting
into really long days of drying because it
[SPEAKER_01]: stayed very moist in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too slow, high risk of atritis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, if you're drying it really fast,
obviously, negative things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loss of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets very crumbly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of reasons why.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to understand this middle ground
to end with a nice product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this is not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots more reps that need to go
into making sure this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, we've got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is the VPD chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks just like the one that you would use
for a grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, we're understanding, you know,
how can we really change our humidity or
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature depending on what our facility
can achieve to have a certain VPD to lose
[SPEAKER_01]: that moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this is still in the works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, it's definitely a guide we need as an
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working a lot with terpenes the
last couple of years mainly because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, we play with smokeable flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, terpenes, terpenes are also very
exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, this is a study that,
you know, I first looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, of course you think,
well, you're drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in a great condition, you're drying
and you're going to lose terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're smelling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how much are you actually losing
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, in this study, you can see the
citation there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this study, even at really good drying
conditions, you know, the best a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator could provide, you're still
losing over half of your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, if I'm a hemp farmer growing four
terpenes, this is significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have three acres of plants and
I want to extract terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, am I going to go through the steps
to dry it, lose half of my terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then extract the terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you want to extract them fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this got my mind turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, we did a few experiments to kind of
follow on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is, you know, the thought,
well, why even dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, there's different purposes for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, I'm sure a lot of you have heard,
you know, people are going down the road
[SPEAKER_01]: of cryo drying and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, this is a study that was done by
Lindy, who is a gas company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they were very interested in doing
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Arrow is a marijuana company in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, Marcus over at CBDVL.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually worked together down in San
Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, what this study looked at was with
the different ways of drying, how does it
[SPEAKER_01]: change cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: With different ways of drying,
how does it change your terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, what I just want to make sure that
you, you know, if you're not a scientist,
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's anomalies, ask more questions
if you know the author.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, if you look at the total
cannabinoids, it looks like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, freeze drying, you know,
you're losing a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: How could that be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you dig in a little further,
what happened in that situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look at the picture on the bottom
left, the freeze dryer was pulling way too
[SPEAKER_01]: hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, the two, from the vacuum
was just covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was trichome loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's not that this, the freeze drying
itself was lowering potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a mechanical problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, we look at total terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, again, the one that
circled, wow, freeze drying is growing
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, this is in fact not true as well
because the fresh flower in this study was
[SPEAKER_01]: not supposed to be dried at the laboratory
and it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it lost some terpenes at the
testing facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, whereas there's lots of
holes, as there is in a lot of research,
[SPEAKER_01]: you take those holes and you fix it for
the next experiment and then you work off
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we did, an acre's worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at oven dried flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at freeze dried flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at flour that was, ran through a
liquid nitrogen conveyor and then freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: dried, which saves a lot of time because
you're putting in flour that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: froze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had fresh flour tested at the
testing facility and I made sure they did
[SPEAKER_01]: not dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which meant I had to do math to account
for the moisture, the dilution that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were showing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not perfect, but we don't have our own
testing facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this was the best we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, these are, this is for
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the big takeaway that we saw
with cannabinoids is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you're being mechanically abusive
to the plants, all the different drying
[SPEAKER_01]: methods are actually doing is decarboxyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're decarboxylating it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, for hemp, it's not a big
deal either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: For marijuana, I guess it's situational.
[SPEAKER_01]: But terpenes is where it got really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the first, the N2FD, that's nitrogen
and then freeze dried, freeze dried oven
[SPEAKER_01]: and then baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, theoretically, the plant, if not
manipulated, should have about 2.5%
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes by dry weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's the bottom number there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, if you dry it with an oven at
harsh temperatures, you're losing a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freeze dried, it's better, but you're
still going to lose something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, if you're instantly
freezing it right out the field and then
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze drying it, you know, that was the
least lost terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, that's kind of the high level look
at this experiment, but it gets even more
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting when you look into the
individual terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this data just came to us like
last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I haven't ran statistics thoroughly,
but I think the takeaways here kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you look, you've got, you know,
baseline of each terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: By dry weight, which is in that flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the bottom, you can see the red
indicates the loss of terpenes compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: the baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the green is the gain of terpenes
compared to the baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, this, you know,
what we're looking at here, it's not just,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, it was, you know, 2 and 5%
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are significant differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're looking at humulene as
it's oven dried, it increased by 84%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a chemist, but I will definitely
be running this across chemists I know and
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemists to help understand,
you know, like what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is conversions happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, very, very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think, you know, this, you know,
what the story is here is that no matter
[SPEAKER_01]: how you're drying it, the terpene profile
that the plant has as a fresh plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, basically understanding how you
want it to smell based off how you dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can kind of tweak because
you'll end up with something different
[SPEAKER_01]: with each drying technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is something that for years
I questioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, is something actually happening
here or is it just homogenation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, is it removing excess
water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it homogenizing throughout the
container?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is ethylene doing in this
process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the plants still alive once they've
got down to this 0.6?
[SPEAKER_01]: Water activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's happening with the
carbohydrates, the pH, the organic acids?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much to question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we understand that, then we can
optimize and speed things up and be
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is an easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this was the burp project.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the bottom axis,
we have different types of burp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, once, open the bucket for 30
minutes once a day, no open, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: an hour for three days, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, the really big takeaway here is
that the bottom portion of the graph,
[SPEAKER_01]: it shows the water activity at the
beginning of curing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we've got pretty big ranges of
samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you see the, oh gosh, what's this
called?
[SPEAKER_01]: The variance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, pretty big variance of
samples water activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after it stays in the buckets for 14
days, you go back, you take water activity
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements again, and at first glance,
it looks like, well, these flowers are
[SPEAKER_01]: gaining moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not actually the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening is, you know,
when you're drying in an environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: the big flowers and the small flowers,
everything's drying at different rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes from the outside of the bud
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the insides are all different
depending on bud size, structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you put them into a chamber where
they all experience the same humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have time to homogenize throughout
the plant, meaning, you know, the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: within the bucket should be the,
should have all of the same moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: content within.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's homogenization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's very easy to quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, we get to the chemistry side of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whew, where do you start?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we look at plants that are similar,
but nothing is exactly the same as
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you've got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we look at the curing of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's lots of ways to cure
tobacco, but some of the takeaways here
[SPEAKER_01]: are, well, yeah, it's done for flavor and
smokability, but they don't care about
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for tobacco, you know,
they're using this process of it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: being alive, getting rid of the
chlorophyll, being in this zombie state to
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve the enzymatic processes they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our flowers stay green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're, though we may change
chlorophyll and harshness, is it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: related to chlorophyll content?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still green.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, other things that are looked at
within the tobacco industry are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, starch to sugar conversions,
degrading carotenes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all these things have different
impact of what the tobacco industry looks
[SPEAKER_01]: as a great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there's things we can pull from
here to test, but it's not a one for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, where do we start?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but we can't do experiments
until we have a little idea of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we got gas, gas sensors, CO2,
O2, and ethylene, and we put them into
[SPEAKER_01]: these seal jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, obviously, you put a fresh bud into a
seal jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to mold and rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we wanted to understand what's
happening with ethylene and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening with O2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, remember back to the definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to look at this step by step.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yellow line is humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is a fresh bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethylene, this bud is alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just picked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're good at rooting, you might even
could make this be another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard when it's in the
flowering stage like that, but in theory,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still in a live plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethylene goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these numbers we're seeing of
ethylene in this fresh stage, meaning high
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene in the drying room because it's
not dried yet, ethylene in your grow is
[SPEAKER_01]: super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, if you're in a situation in your
growing facility where you're not bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: in fresh air because you're wanting to
ramp up your CO2, you know, how high are
[SPEAKER_01]: you getting the ethylene in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something I want to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, is it bad or is it good that
it's in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do we want to tweak it right when it's
ripening?
[SPEAKER_01]: But takeaway is, in a jar, it gets very
high in ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other takeaway here is, you know,
looking at O2 and CO2, this plant is still
[SPEAKER_01]: alive because we see it breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we see there is active CO2,
there is active O2 being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this, on the other hand,
is a graph showing CO2 and oxygen after it
[SPEAKER_01]: hits.6%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we've dried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at the end of our dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily breathing anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that does not necessarily mean that
there could be other microbes on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: doing certain things, which we've got some
research coming out kind of looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: that of that interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, respiration is insignificant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's looking at CO2 and O2.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we look at ethylene, ethylene is
still being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we manipulate it a certain way,
will we get one result versus the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: better or worse?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least now we have a target of
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, from here, we can shape
manipulation to see what we'll make for a
[SPEAKER_01]: better product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the question is, well,
what does a better product mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you've got to get people
involved to give opinions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's harder than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Props to the speaker before me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, from these very,
very upfront, quick experiments to lead
[SPEAKER_01]: into the next ones that will have more
significance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what we found is that there's a
lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of water in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, almost 80%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moist buds have high respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in your dry room where you think it's
ambient to maybe outside, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of respiration going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of ethylene being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you get it to, you know,
the water activity where you would want to
[SPEAKER_01]: put it into the next stage, the curing,
you know, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was surprising to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured there would still be a lot of
gas exchange happening, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning we burp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We burp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, is burping actually
important?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a gas that we're not tracking
that is making this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the theory that curing is making for a
better smut?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as you can see, a lot of, yeah,
it did this, but what's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, going back to this,
there is, there's so much more to
[SPEAKER_01]: investigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, so the way our research works is the
HempMine, which is my company,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Clemson University is where I went to
school with my old major professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually created a coalition,
we call it the Cannabis Research
[SPEAKER_01]: Coalition, that looks at, that includes
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It funds the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the research goes to those
members.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is stakeholder focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is not just research that
other researchers want to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is research that is going to tell
you, all right, well, if you give the,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you give the plants two more hours of
light per day, you're going to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: your yield by 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a multi-million dollar
company, that 20% is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we want to provide
research that, yes, is science based,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you saw, but we want it to be very
applicable immediately to a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what rooting hormone to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's going to take you from
having 70% success in rooting to 90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that that will strengthen the
industry immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now, of course, a university is
involved, meaning they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: publish, but as you know, not a lot of
people are in a hurry to get publications,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it could take a year or two to get
those out, meaning those members do get
[SPEAKER_01]: that very early perk one-on-one of what
they could potentially do to use science
[SPEAKER_01]: to make their grow more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: More profitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we have any time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Allison, thank you very much for your
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a registered nurse, I did a
presentation on this for the American
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis Nurses Association, but I
digress.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your opinion of the new Boveda
packets and those humidity packets that we
[SPEAKER_05]: find so often in our THC products in
Colorado?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you find that that is going to cause
issues long term?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to hear what you have to say
about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't done a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak to the microbial effect of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In theory, you know, there's different
choices of humidity packs you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're able to stay under that,
you know, 0.6 water activity, then in
[SPEAKER_01]: theory, you shouldn't be, you know,
introducing water to increase microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have seen, with that said,
I have seen very dry crumbly flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, become a better state with
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are actually working with Boveda.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where some of the funding comes
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, they're looking to make
themselves better by having, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: very nitty-gritty data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, yeah, I've seen good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in theory, it should not be,
have a negative effect for health safety,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your work and a great
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Will Vasuete from Bioscientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do measurements of emission rates
in the ambient air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see significant emission rates
almost an order of magnitude higher in the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying room than we do in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my question is, have you thought
about or have you done anything about
[SPEAKER_00]: using ambient measurements, not the
terpenes in the plant, but in the air to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to optimize or look at optimal drying
rates?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, have your alternative drying
rates done anything with odor emissions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, one of the next steps for this
research is looking at the head space in
[SPEAKER_01]: the curing containers to see, you know,
because you open a jar and you smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's volatileizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so understanding, you know,
what are we losing through this process as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as individual terpenes and what is
being left in the flower and what makes
[SPEAKER_01]: that difference and how can it be
manipulated?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, to be honest, nobody cares
about odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everywhere I've worked, as far as
marijuana goes, that's not been a
[SPEAKER_01]: requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've not had to go down that road of
figuring out how to stop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm just trying to figure out how
to keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the mic on?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as terpenes, we haven't looked at
that specifically, but there is a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're pulling off just the
stems, you're usually leaving the large
[SPEAKER_01]: bases behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're definitely able to dry faster
because there's less physical water to
[SPEAKER_01]: remove.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anecdotally, not set experimentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've not seen much difference as far as
cannabinoids or terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can prevent botrytis in the drying
stage, does a longer dry period lead to a
[SPEAKER_02]: better end product past like the 15-day
point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people cure for six months,
you know, and I've seen people cure for
[SPEAKER_01]: three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, by nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the three-day cure smell just as
good as, you know, months and months of
[SPEAKER_01]: cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a longer stage where some of
these conversions could happen for maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: better smoke, which then gets very tough
because that's, you know, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: qualitative of how it makes you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least on data, I've not seen a big
difference between the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with starting to understand
this more and more, we eventually will be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to say, okay, well, you're seeing
this effect from three months,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's because this is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happening over three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, since we know it's happening,
let's do it in three days and achieve the
[SPEAKER_01]: same end result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the goal is to be able
to understand it fully where we can guide
[SPEAKER_01]: those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, people aren't curing for
three months just for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure they've seen differences
over time that are allowing them to make
[SPEAKER_01]: that call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're a grower, I mean,
that's a long time to wait for your money
[SPEAKER_01]: for your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I imagine there's a reason it's been
done traditionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there are actually companies that
make these automated devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think AutoCure is one where basically
it's a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if a humidity gets to a
certain amount, or it could be on a timer
[SPEAKER_01]: where it purges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have anecdotally seen by smell a great
difference between burping and not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't been able to put a data
point behind that yet to match it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, at this point in time,
I can't tell you from science experience
[SPEAKER_01]: that that is something you should do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you should do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my science can't tell you why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Curing and drying has fueled many
conversations and the cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: community, and we all have our opinions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm one of those guys that believes in
a long, slow cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: My flower stays on the stick for over
three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing that we've noticed
anecdotally among all of us when we break
[SPEAKER_04]: out our bags and our boxes and we start
sharing with everybody is we've noticed a
[SPEAKER_04]: difference in plants that are grown full
term and full sun retain and have a
[SPEAKER_04]: broader profile and retain that profile
for longer than a flower that's grown
[SPEAKER_04]: indoors from clone that has a forced photo
period.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we call it the nutrient density of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, taking that into account or
seeing any information with that and also
[SPEAKER_04]: the curing versus on the stick versus
popping the buds off and curing it that
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: We notice on the stick, we've got longer
retention of a broader spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I definitely believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to take the same cultivar and
put one outdoors and one indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so many differences,
probably light levels, spectrum of light,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that's going to affect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even we'll say you're growing
under HPS lights and you're very close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that that radiant heat is going to
change the terpenes that are there because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're losing a lot more than you might
would under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of that is changing,
you know, to the extent where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: measure that, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I definitely believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I would ask you and your
experience because this matters to apply
[SPEAKER_01]: to the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you choose to do it three months?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trained by cultivators who have been
doing it for generations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have five-year-old flower that I
smoke and it's beautiful, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: You open the bucket and it smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've noticed like the difference
between a triple second of Grand Marnier.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get that age with a wine or an alcohol
and you find that it brings out other
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know Frenchy Canole did some studies
with his hash where he's noticing new
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes being produced like hash-a-sheen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that aging and that mellowing,
we find it's a mellower smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's we consider it a candidate in a
sewer class because we notice a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary specifically here in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't buy flower that's over six
months old and they hate outdoor flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want the blingy indoor flash fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we notice if you take a one-year-old
bag of outdoor flower versus a
[SPEAKER_04]: one-year-old bag of indoor flower,
the outdoor still is almost like the day
[SPEAKER_04]: that, you know, you were working with the
cure and the indoor doesn't seem to have
[SPEAKER_04]: the longevity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's extremely interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you what or why, but
hopefully in a year we'll have some good
[SPEAKER_01]: data points.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean what I would like to say is I
would love to be able to sample from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, batches like this and us put
some data points on, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is being done legacy style and figure
that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now's the time to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole lot of outdoor flower
sitting unused up north.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything he just said also is very much
pertinent.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I really appreciate your work so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really helped me over the past couple
of years understand post-production.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I follow your research.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess my question would be around
ethylene blockers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you have experimented with ethylene
blockers in post-production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's something I just I just
squeeze it in 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in those still jars, we would add one
MCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So inhibits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually added at the fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adding ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as cannabinoids and terpenes,
there was no significant changes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was extremely surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to repeat that study.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want to look at it in
something bigger than a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there's some value to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in curing, it's not as
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it might be in drying and in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're not seeing those changes
in curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't mean that it's not
affecting something differently that we
[SPEAKER_01]: hadn't measured yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though there's no change in
terpenes or cannabinoids, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe that extra ethylene accumulation or
release because we burp, maybe that is
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing to it, for example,
starts to sugar conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're just testing those two
simple things, it's going to look like it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next step is looking at headspace.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking at some of those other
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pH, you know, that's a really important
one in tobacco is the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that affects the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at total sugars, looking at
nutrient content and pairing that with
[SPEAKER_01]: with flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, yes, if you flush it,
it takes down the actual nutrient content
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more little bit is I really do think
that it's incredibly important because a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of people are speaking to how product
has to be so fresh in order for it to be
[SPEAKER_06]: sold.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do feel like we don't have science
to back that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a lot of people speaking
publicly that this is a fact and it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: science.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd love to see more around that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you again for your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
