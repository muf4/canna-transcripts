[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'd like to thank Medicinal
Genomics and Cartogen Organizing,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one of the best cannabis meetings
that I have ever attended.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was equally impressive last year as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poverty Laboratories is an ISO 17025
accredited laboratory serving the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space for the state of
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, we work with dispensaries,
we work with patients, caregivers,
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the things that I'm going
to talk about today are actual things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we see day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to bring awareness to
contaminants because people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: sourcing their material from unknown
vendors are bringing it to us for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is, in general,
pretty horrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about contaminants,
I think about mother nature versus human
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, the plant might have some components
that might be considered contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what I'm most concerned about
things that we as humans introduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to screw things up when we touch
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is no different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as contaminants, we need to look
at how do we cultivate the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we process the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, we're introducing contaminants
during that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We as a lab think it's very important for
producers to look at a hazard analysis and
[SPEAKER_00]: critical control point plan for any
processing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do we measure and report
contaminants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we regulate?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people here from all across the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of my numbers that I'm going
to show are basically state to state
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure if you expand that to a
global scale, you'll just expand those
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the different contaminants
that are required for testing by various
[SPEAKER_00]: states, you can see that there is no real
synchronicity between the different states
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as what testing is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets even more challenging if you start
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they may test for pesticides in these
multiple states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start looking at the limits
that you have to test for, appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: limits of contamination, it becomes very
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our lab, we use a variety of analytical
techniques to address all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochemical constituents as well as
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to talk about a few
focusing on the contaminants that we use
[SPEAKER_00]: and look for in our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I do that, I want to talk a
little bit about units.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite quotes, you get
somebody calling the lab and says,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you guys do the PPM test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I say, well, yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also provide the PPB test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when people who don't have a
science background to understand what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference between weight percent,
PPM, and PPB.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about residual
solvents, we might be talking in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for heavy metals, we might be focused
more on parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets even more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of regulators will choose to use
exposure limits in the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically saying, how much contaminant can
there be per kilogram of body weight per
[SPEAKER_00]: week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in order for me as a testing lab to
understand what that means from a pass
[SPEAKER_00]: fail on a contaminant level, I have to
know how much the person weighs and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much they're going to consume each day or
each week.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of regulators don't understand
all that extra verbiage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they will truncate it and just say,
well, it makes per kg is PPM, micrograms
[SPEAKER_00]: per kilogram is PPB.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it ends up in the regs being numbers
that are just extremely low and
[SPEAKER_00]: inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we see happening is when
another state is coming online,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll look at another state,
they'll grab those regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see these mistakes getting
propagated from one mistake to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, the first state corrects
it, but then the second state never
[SPEAKER_00]: learns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it leads to some really significant
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a saying in our lab that
says, letters and numbers mean something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you look at these units here,
what this actually means is that every
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram of soil can contain no more than
400,000 kilograms of lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assured them that they meant a little m
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took some time to convince them that
little m and big M did not mean the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are some of the challenges that
we address.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk primarily about
pesticides, plant growth regulators,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals, microbiological
contaminants, and process impurities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about contaminants,
we have to consider the root of
[SPEAKER_00]: administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what is of concern is going to be
very dependent on how that product is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be administered, whether orally,
sublingually, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need to consider the matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an edible product, if it's an
atopical product, is it in the acid form
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA versus THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be some different considerations
that need to be taken into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at pesticide, that's probably
one of the worst ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ryan talked a lot about that with some
really good data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that from state to state,
there's very significant differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of what the pesticides they can use,
what the pesticides need to be tested for,
[SPEAKER_00]: what levels are acceptable in the
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that just in a couple states,
you can see a huge variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada, some of the pesticides are from 10
to 10,000 parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts, we hardly have to test any
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the prohibited pesticides
that we're testing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to test them down to 10 parts
per billion, which makes it very
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging from an analytical standpoint,
which needs more expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumentation, which ultimately,
that price goes up and gets passed on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as an example, in California,
there was a report that they saw
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides in about greater than 84% of
their samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a real concern for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at some of the different
limits of acceptability by state,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that, let's just look at
cifluthrin.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Nevada, the acceptable contamination is
4,000 parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, 1,000 parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Massachusetts, 10 parts per
billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which is the right answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the challenges for regulators
is that there isn't a lot of toxicological
[SPEAKER_00]: data on these pesticides when it comes to
inhalation in the first place,
[SPEAKER_00]: but inhalation versus combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes it very difficult for them to
pick regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're looking for pesticides,
we're using a triple-quam aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at multiple transitions
and fragmentation of the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a way that we can confirm that
what we're actually seeing is a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: and not an interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a flower sample that
we saw some contamination of myclobutanil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was significant concentration there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after extraction, that concentration
of pesticide went up to over 5 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a pretty significant
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pesticides behave very similar to
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing a process that is going
to concentrate and enrich the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, you're also going to be
concentrating and enriching the pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That had a serious impact for us on our
extraction equipment because after this
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, we now have a contaminated
piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us several weeks to clean that
piece of equipment to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after each cleaning, we did a cleaning
validation only to find out that we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cleaned it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did cleaning validation again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cleaning validation is something that
we're trying to get across to the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: as a very important tool that can be used
to ensure that you're not passing on
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination through your processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy metal toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is well known to bioaccumulate
the toxic heavy metals from the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: other environmental sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the toxicity data is relative to
ingestion rather than inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do know that you can get inhalation
through the mainstream smoke from either
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking or vaping cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more research needed to understand
the implications of what that means so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the regulators have an idea of what
can they set as a safe level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical sources for heavy metals include
water, growing medium, nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: processing equipment, and hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably one of the most common that we
see is from the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say they're using organic
nutrients, therefore it should be free of
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But organic nutrients also can frequently
have heavy metal contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some limits from some
various states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most states just refer to the four
heaviest, mercury, cadmium, arsenic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are naturally occurring elements,
so it's very important to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguish between ambient concentrations
of these metals as well as contamination
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see just that there's a huge,
just like in the pesticides, you see a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge variance in what is an acceptable
level of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, whose limits are most appropriate?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of testing, in Massachusetts
we have to test every batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that really necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have your processes established,
should you be required to test every
[SPEAKER_00]: single batch or should you do periodic
testing after you've tested your water
[SPEAKER_00]: source, your nutrients, your soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've confirmed that what you're
using is free from contaminants,
[SPEAKER_00]: should you have to be continually testing
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are questions that need answering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use inductively coupled mass plasma
spectrometry for measurement of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals, basically where the samples,
whether it's a gummy bear or a brownie or
[SPEAKER_00]: flour, is digested with microwave assist
and a concentrated nitric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's basically infused into a
plasma source where it's ionized and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we measure the mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we talk to a lot of our
clients about is when you have a product,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you're using nutrients that have
heavy metals in it, you can see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: first sample, the raw plant material,
would fail the Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_00]: specifications for concentration of heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraction techniques can often be used to
remediate that contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these metals are not soluble
in typical extraction solvents and by
[SPEAKER_00]: extracting the cannabinoids out of there,
unlike the pesticides, in the pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to concentrate the
pesticides, the heavy metal materials are
[SPEAKER_00]: typically left behind and so it's a way of
remediating heavy metal contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple other sources that people don't
think about, and these are really
[SPEAKER_00]: critical, is your processing equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real example where we actually
saw shards of metal that were probably two
[SPEAKER_00]: to four millimeters in an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we tested these for heavy metal,
we saw iron, chromium and nickel,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably whoever made this equipment had
it turned in some machine shop and they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do a good job of flushing out the
residual particulate matter and it ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up in people's products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that is of concern is these
vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do most of these vape pens get made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of them in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully there will be some U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers soon, but because of that,
these pens can look identical from one
[SPEAKER_00]: vendor to the next and you don't know
what's inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked with some people in the past
to do some studies on the heating elements
[SPEAKER_00]: and so what we actually have done is hook
up a smoking machine to these and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: draw off the vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collect that vapor on basically a
cigarette filter and analyze that for the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals and what we have seen is
aluminum, copper, nickel, chromium.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all elements that are frequently
part of the coil for these vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see that some people are now moving
to ceramic coils which might be a much
[SPEAKER_00]: safer alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the cigarette type filter
that we've used to collect the heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Residual solvents is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's doing some kind of extraction,
especially when you start talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation of therapeutics for children,
geriatrics, just your average person who
[SPEAKER_00]: wants a capsule or a tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You typically have to extract the
cannabinoid from the flour material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it a lot easier to reproducibly
dose and so some kind of extraction is
[SPEAKER_00]: typically used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different classifications for
solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which ones are appropriate for use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly we try and stick to solvents
like ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably our favorite just because
of the low toxicity of it and because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty ubiquitous in our everyday life
anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are hydrocarbon extractions acceptable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to me that depends on what kind of
hydrocarbon you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most states recommend that you use 99%
pure butane to do an extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my concern is what's in that 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using 99.99% pure butane,
what's in that .001%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we start looking at that contaminant
in that material, I'm on the fence about
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not butane hydrocarbon
extractions are appropriate because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what that impurity is and I can
pretty much guarantee you that that
[SPEAKER_00]: impurity is going to end up in your
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what limits are appropriate?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last three, four months,
Massachusetts went from a limit of 1 ppm
[SPEAKER_00]: for butane to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over that same period of time,
Colorado went for the same butane limits
[SPEAKER_00]: from 800 ppm to 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 5,000 ppm is .5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be vaping something that's
.5% butane?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want your family members vaping
something that's that high?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so what limits are most appropriate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one of the things
Massachusetts has done, and it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrating for us as an analytical lab,
but Massachusetts has chosen very
[SPEAKER_00]: stringent guidelines with the thought that
as we have more data, we can loosen those
[SPEAKER_00]: up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is the right approach,
but hopefully they'll move forward and
[SPEAKER_00]: loosen them up some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we talk with a lot of
our clients about is cleaning solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We very frequently talk to people who are
doing ice water hash and we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, that's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use any solvents in my process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, what about when you're done?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, well, we clean our equipment
with isopropanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, how do you know that that
isopropanol that you're using is not the
[SPEAKER_00]: same isopropanol I'm showing in your
bubble hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which it turns out after some studies,
we show that these solvents that you use
[SPEAKER_00]: for cleaning end up in your product if
you're not doing cleaning validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaning validation is a whole field unto
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the pharmaceutical industry,
everybody knows what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just part of the process of
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that people need to be more
aware of in the cannabis processing
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's just another slide just showing
some of the variability from state to
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see that there's a little bit more
synchronicity starting to form with the
[SPEAKER_00]: residual solvents as they kind of have
chosen to standardize for the most part on
[SPEAKER_00]: USP residual solvent standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USP does not have any standards for
beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the other ones, they seem to be
settling in on some pretty similar values.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just an example that we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was brought in from a client that had
a butane level of about 1,300 ppm butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these people, when you have
extracts that don't have butane,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't taste the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're missing that taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, that's the contaminant
you're missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then microbiological contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the concern is with the
contaminants that we're introducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes, the actual production
processes will kill microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing an ethanol extraction,
if you're doing a decarboxylation,
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes these processes themselves will
destroy some microbiological contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have to be concerned about if
you're making a product that doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: heating involved with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're making a tincture that's based
on a cannabinoid acid where you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to heat it too much, you might have to
think about some other potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiological contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that heating may not kill some of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be relying on that heating step
to kill microbial contamination that is
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these really have to be taken into
account when states are making regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: on the different levels of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different ways to measure
microbiological contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the plating techniques are
probably the most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a combination of all of these,
actually, where we're using what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: the most probable number enumeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're seeing more and more
DNA-based techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for good reason, I'll explain in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But DNA-based techniques that can be more
specific to the actual DNA of the organism
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most states currently are using the
American Herbal Pharmacopeia Guidelines as
[SPEAKER_00]: a basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states have also added in mycotoxin
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I put here the typical levels for
contamination for flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the challenges of that,
when you have people that are cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: with pesticides, we're asking them not to
use pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to give them tools to use
without pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's beneficial insects,
but there's also beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's beneficial fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are beneficial microbials that
they can use so that they don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: rely on pesticides so heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with those recommendations is
that if they start to use those beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, they're going to start failing
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these are not specific to the
organism, but rather to a class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you start to look at DNA-based
techniques that have the specificity,
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes much more appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple important considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, you have to communicate with
the state and local regulatory agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: ISO accreditation bodies have an enormous
amount of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our instrument vendors have been
phenomenal in terms of getting us guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: and helping us with developing methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are currently about 10 or 11
different organizations that are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish testing methodologies for the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people who are in the cannabis
industry, for the most part, are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: tight-lipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to share their methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the scientific way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scientific way, you have to
communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to validate in other labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to share methodologies and work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we still see that there's more need
for that communication to develop those
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized testing methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then proficiency testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proficiency testing is one of my biggest
challenges because we can't take a sample
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis and send it to every lab in
the US because of crossing state lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very challenging to do a
proficiency testing program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for many contaminants, toxicity is
cumulative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivation processing activities need
to consider the different sources to
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, a lot more work needs to be
done in understanding the toxicity,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when it comes to inhalation,
combustion and inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are areas that really need more
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regulatory considerations are becoming
more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the numbers in my slide may be off
because literally the states are revving
[SPEAKER_00]: them constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then standardized methods and
proficiency testing are really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: help the labs generate reliable data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, as part of that whole
process, we need to communicate better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to thank my colleagues at Proverde
Laboratories, as well as a number of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors who we've worked with over the
past three or four years who have just,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I said, been very supportive and
helpful in our processes getting up and
[SPEAKER_00]: running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'd like to thank you.
Thank you.
