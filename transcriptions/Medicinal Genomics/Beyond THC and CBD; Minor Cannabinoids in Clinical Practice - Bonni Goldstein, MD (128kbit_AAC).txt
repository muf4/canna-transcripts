[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't this a great conference?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been having a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said they have to have it here every
year because they can't really do better
[SPEAKER_01]: than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys all know my background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I trained as a pediatrician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked in pediatric emergency medicine
for many years, had a little need for some
[SPEAKER_01]: sanity, took some time off, and my friend
was fighting cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Asked me about cannabis, and that was my
introduction, was to do research for my
[SPEAKER_01]: friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't looked back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a fine setup for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to talk about the minor
cannabinoids in clinical practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard some about this already from
Dr. Russo and from other speakers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is the phyto cannabinoid
synthesis showing that CBGA is kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mother, the precursor of all the other
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, we have numerous raw
compounds, heated and as well as aged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, too, there's CBGVA, which is
apparent to the varin line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, we're going to talk about the
ones that I'm circling here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do agree with Deddy that we can no
longer call, which he mentioned yesterday,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can no longer call CBG a minor
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has moved up into the big
leagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's becoming very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It clearly has incredible benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is what I'm going to be showing
you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we'll talk about CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's all the targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, multi targets, very hard to
predict somebody's underlying chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: and how they're going to respond to CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one I want to point out,
the star should be a little further down
[SPEAKER_01]: that alpha two adrenergic, because it is
what stands out separately from some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see that with the other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this particular target can help with
numerous disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do see it help with numerous
disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also just want to point out the
trip channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that a lot of people don't really
know what those are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, I'm just going to give you a
cheat sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lovely article.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is your trip channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a family of ion channels that was
discovered in 1969.
[SPEAKER_01]: They promote sodium and calcium influx
into cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're involved in many diseases,
including neuropathic pain, inflammation,
[SPEAKER_01]: respiratory disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're activated by many different
triggers, including heat, cold,
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanical skin changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when your skin stretches,
that's your trip channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spicy foods, toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever had really good,
freshly made olive oil and you get that
[SPEAKER_01]: peppery taste in the back of your throat,
that's with your trip channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, of course, by cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some of the ones that we know
that cannabinoids target.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many more trip channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's your cheat sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they involved in?
[SPEAKER_01]: So nervous system, gut, immune.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound like the endocannabinoid
system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pain, inflammation, itch, and cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is just giving you kind of a
boiled down way to think about trip
[SPEAKER_01]: channels when you read about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the research or somebody's talking
about it as a target for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBG is anti-cancer through the trip M8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see here, CBG hampers colon
cancer progression, selectively inhibits
[SPEAKER_01]: the growth of colorectal tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is a preclinical model.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a human model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we have now cannabigerals showing
potential for glioblastoma multiforme,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been talked about quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this conference, remember that this is
a condition that is quite deadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: 200,000 people die each year, 15,000 in
Europe, 9,000 in the US, according to
[SPEAKER_01]: gliocor.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBG was found to be comparable to THC
in killing glioblastoma cells,
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibiting the invasion of these cancer
cells, and also, very importantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: destroying the therapy resistance stem
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the stem cells you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may go through treatment, be told that
you have no evidence of disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you still have some of these cells
lurking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Hergenrather, a fellow cannabis
physician in California, has been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this longer than I have, had a patient who
stayed on cannabis for nine years after
[SPEAKER_01]: his glioblastoma was surgically removed,
and he stopped cannabis and his cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a patient in my practice three and a
half years with glioblastoma, was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: great, decided to travel the world with
his kids and left his cannabis at home,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he relapsed within five or six weeks,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, when it came back,
it came back with a vengeance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's my opinion that if you get to NED
with or without cannabis, you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: should continue to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else are you gonna take?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't take chemotherapy and get
radiated, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what else can you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take care of yourself,
but include cannabinoids as part of your
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-cancer protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell this to every patient,
and I'll just share one last story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a three-year-old come to me who had
a terrible version or chromosomal type of
[SPEAKER_01]: leukemia, and at three, it's so difficult
to treat these kids, because they're aware
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to know what you're doing,
but they're not old enough to understand,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it is torture for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she ended up getting a bone marrow
transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: She relapsed three months later,
came to see me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was in remission with cannabis in a
plant-based diet alone, in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stayed on cannabis for eight months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what happened in the family,
but apparently there was some disruption
[SPEAKER_01]: in the family unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't afford the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't call me, and she relapsed
about three months later, and then got
[SPEAKER_01]: another bone marrow transplant and died
from fungal pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, her bone marrow,
when they checked her bone marrow,
[SPEAKER_01]: it had 100% grafted, so she was actually
doing really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really do think that going off
cannabis was probably not a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else about CBG?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it reduces neuroinflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a preclinical study looking at
CBG alone and in combination with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG alone wasn't really found to be
effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD was effective at a very high dose,
but when combined, as you've heard over
[SPEAKER_01]: and over during this conference,
it was the most effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down-regulating pro-inflammatory compounds
and increasing anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, and then they also showed in
this study some PPAR-mediated
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and
anti-epoptotic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, the PPARs are the receptors
that sit on the nucleus inside the cell,
[SPEAKER_01]: also interacting with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Analgesic, we know that from this
particular study that it reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: chemo-induced mechanical hypersensitivity,
which is kind of a model of neuropathic
[SPEAKER_01]: pain, but a combo of CBD and CBG,
here it is again, was more effective than
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I found three articles on appetite
stimulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have patients that tell me that CBG
gives them the munchies, and I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: that happens for everybody, but reading
through these articles, there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: indication that CBG may help with
chemotherapy-associated weight loss and
[SPEAKER_01]: loss of appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who might this help?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, someone who might be reluctant to
take THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting drug tested at work,
or they don't like the effects of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they don't have access to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this might be helpful for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still, I'm still not sure
exactly if this is a true effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not treated anybody who has this
particular indication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now also metabolic homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a really interesting article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to read it about five times to
understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's really interesting about it is
that it showed that CBG, acting through
[SPEAKER_01]: PPAR, improved insulin sensitivity,
and THCV gets a lot of credit for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but CBG appears to do something very
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also improves adipogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's creating fat cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you might think, well, we don't wanna
do that, but remember that there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: physiologic reason that you have fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't wanna have too much fat,
and part of that is to help prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: lipotoxicity of origin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want your lipids to get into
your heart and your liver and other
[SPEAKER_01]: organs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so CBG appears to help with this
metabolic homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also anti-soriatic, having skin
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there was a CanMed a couple
years ago that someone did this,
[SPEAKER_01]: presented this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine
release due to certain triggers,
[SPEAKER_01]: including UV light, chemical irritation
and bacteria that causes acne.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases was more potent than CBD
for this indication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Ethan touched on this yesterday,
so I'm not gonna spend too much time on
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but this was the first survey of
patients using CBG, and these are the most
[SPEAKER_01]: common conditions that he discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And needless to say, it was highly rated
by participants and reported greater
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy than pharmaceuticals,
with some mild side effects which appeared
[SPEAKER_01]: to be THC related as some patients had
preparations that had THC in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're gonna move on to CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, will you give me a heads up at five
minutes, by the way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's your CBDA targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had to change this yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to recreate, because I've been
looking at the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no CB1, CB2 activity, and lo and
behold, what do you find when you look to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you're not leaving something out
that were the latest literature,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's kinda coming down pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that same study that I just talked
about, they report that CBDA does act
[SPEAKER_01]: through CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least what happened was when they used
a CB2 agonist, it blocked this effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there may be something else there,
but it is a signal that maybe there is
[SPEAKER_01]: some activity at CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is converting bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells to fat cells, so increased
[SPEAKER_01]: proliferation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I was really happy to find this,
because Dr. Mishulam did this in February.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was published February 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoid receptor 2 blockade prevents
antidepressant-like effects using the more
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilized version of cannabidiol in
female rats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, if you wanna take a look at that,
another study that showed some,
[SPEAKER_01]: that blockade blocks the effect,
and is CBDA working through that CB2?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a CB2 mechanism, whether directly or
indirectly, we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of anti-convulsant effects,
there's two studies that came out,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, pre-clinical, and you can see here
that they were looking at pharmacokinetics
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cytokinabinoid acids, and also the
anti-convulsant effect of CBDA in a mouse
[SPEAKER_01]: model of Dravet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not familiar with Dravet,
it's a genetic disorder that causes very
[SPEAKER_01]: severe neurocognitive problems,
and also horrific seizures in children,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it appears about two years of life,
so these children kind of look healthy for
[SPEAKER_01]: the first two years of life, and then they
start having terrible seizures,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually in response to heat or a fever,
and then it just goes downhill from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did CBDA do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the two bars to the right
at CBDA significantly increased the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had a Dravet patient come into
my office when the air conditioning was
[SPEAKER_01]: out, and the parents would not bring her
into my office.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to do the evaluation out in the
hallway because they were terrified with
[SPEAKER_01]: the heat in the office that she would have
seizures, so this is a real concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBDA has some signaling here for
anti-convulsant activity, and here's
[SPEAKER_01]: another one exhibiting entourage-like
improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this study in rats, what they did
was they created a compound that they
[SPEAKER_01]: called chylobonoid, 74% CBDA, but other
cannabinoids included, and they also used
[SPEAKER_01]: this model of adding a magnesium to help
these compounds transport through lipid
[SPEAKER_01]: barriers, lipid cell barriers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they had a magnesium CBDA,
it's almost like a pure CBDA, and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see it does not have the CBD, and the THCA
has slightly less THC, also has a similar
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of magnesium, and then they
compared it to a CBD isolate, 99.99%,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the compounds were
anti-convulsant, but the chylobonoid
[SPEAKER_01]: exhibited potency at a level statistically
significant, similar to CBD, and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: minimal effective dose of the chylobonoid
was significantly lower, despite having a
[SPEAKER_01]: less potency of CBDA compared to that
magnesium CBDA that didn't have the other
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, and so again, this kind of
points to synergy or entourage,
[SPEAKER_01]: so remember that that's part of it as
well, and so that was an interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used CBDA in some of my pediatric
patients with severe intractable epilepsy
[SPEAKER_01]: who did not do well with either CBD or
THCA or THC, and you have to remember in
[SPEAKER_01]: California things kind of came down the
line, it wasn't all available at once,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I got to introduce things kind of in a
chronologic way and kind of see how they
[SPEAKER_01]: worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDA does show some activity for some
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the families say my child just
seemed less agitated, and is that treating
[SPEAKER_01]: the neuroinflammation possibly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it overall inflammation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it gut brain?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to know, and so a nice article,
if you want to look, Formato in 2020 gave
[SPEAKER_01]: this nice slide of just kind of the
summaries, and so you can see this
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory effect at not only the
receptor level, but also transcriptional
[SPEAKER_01]: level and the enzymatic level,
lowering COX2, anti-imetic in the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: it interacts with the 5-HT1A, and I have
used CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a breast cancer patient many years
ago who was on high doses of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was quite tolerant to the THC at that
point, and she started a new chemo which
[SPEAKER_01]: made her have terrible nausea and
vomiting, and low-dose CBDA took care of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, so we just added it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it's an N of one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that will work for
everybody else, but it's something to
[SPEAKER_01]: think about in patients who either don't
want to take THC as an anti-imetic or who
[SPEAKER_01]: need an add-on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already talked about anti-convulsant
and then also anti-cancerogenic,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so there's some evidence in breast
cancer, a couple breast cancer studies
[SPEAKER_01]: that show decreased cell proliferation and
decreased cell migration, so just a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: study of the summary of the medicinal
properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a patient report, so this is at the
other end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have adult patients that I follow
for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 91-year-old male who has been a
patient for six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smiling because every time he sees me,
he always asks me, how's Dr. Russo?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a huge fan, so I just wanted to let
you know, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just tell him I say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Age-related ailments, avid reader of the
cannabis research, which he only
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered as he was older.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had arthritis and insomnia,
which California can approve him,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he was really looking for wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he said to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be well in my old age,
and so he was taking a low-dose
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation of four-to-one CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he found to work well for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helped his arthritis, and it helped his
sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got a call from him that he had
developed gout, and he was given opioids
[SPEAKER_01]: by his primary care, and he said,
not only do they not work, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: pooped in about two weeks, and I'm
miserable, and he actually said to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is how I have to live,
you have to help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The four-to-one helped, but it really did
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't take care of his pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is it was restricting his
ability to be mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was sitting at home with his leg
elevated and putting ice on, and he's a
[SPEAKER_01]: guy who lives near the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes to go out for a walk,
and a very active older person.
[SPEAKER_01]: He happened to have some CBDA capsules
that I had recommended the last time when
[SPEAKER_01]: he came to see me for his arthritis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fairly new product.
[SPEAKER_01]: These capsules come as 25 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've tasted some of the CBDA
preparations out there, anybody have a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin, they're really difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just terrible taste, and people don't
like them, so I didn't want to turn them
[SPEAKER_01]: off to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started them on two capsules twice
a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I didn't feel that I had time
to start lower and go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to hit them hard and get the
inflammation down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him dosing instructions over a
period of two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did it in six days, and a complete
resolution of the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: After two weeks, he said, you know,
it's a little pricey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to lower my dose,
but the pain returned, and he figured out
[SPEAKER_01]: if he took 150 milligrams once a day that
his pain was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time I talked to him was to renew
his letter, and he said, everything's
[SPEAKER_01]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have time to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to reschedule because
I'm having lunch with my friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think he forgot the appointment,
and so he remains pain-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: He continues to take his low dose four to
one, and he's still taking his CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, multi-targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I made these charts was because
I was starting to get confused on which
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid targets which receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to remember them all,
and so I made these targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that THCA does have some activity
at CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you have to remember, though,
that THCA is very hard to isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always going to be a tiny little
bit of THC, so it's always hard to know
[SPEAKER_01]: when somebody has a response to THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it because of that little bit of
low-dose THC that might be in the product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's three studies that I wanted just to
show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: THCA reducing adiposity and helping with
metabolic syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, THCA is a potent PPAR agonist
showing neuroprotective activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then this last one from Hananit who's
here in the room, so thank you for your
[SPEAKER_01]: research, showing anti-inflammatory
activity through the GPR55 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different labs find different
affinities, and that's why it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to know what's happening at the
cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know that THCA can be a very
potent anti-nausea medicine in very low
[SPEAKER_01]: doses, and of course, I've used it for
anti-inflammatory effects in my patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry, that bottom one should be
not there, but you can see the top one is
[SPEAKER_01]: an article that Dustin and I published
along with Dr. Russell Sanito who's a
[SPEAKER_01]: neurologist at Seattle Children's
Hospital, and if you'd like to read about
[SPEAKER_01]: THCA and pediatric epilepsy, there's a
really nice section in there that Dustin
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote that's really beautiful and explains
THCA quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's another article that came
out showing some possible anti-convulsant
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was really mixed, and what they found
was in a focal seizure model that THCA was
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-convulsive, but only when THC was
present with it, but it wasn't effective,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was also found to be pro-convulsant
in some other seizure models in purified
[SPEAKER_01]: forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have used THCA in my patients,
and I'm gonna share with you one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an actual chief complaint list
of a 17-year-old that came to see me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mom has to type it out because she has
no room to put it on the paperwork that we
[SPEAKER_01]: give her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he started off being, he was born in
the year 2000, and he was diagnosed with
[SPEAKER_01]: autism, followed by seizure disorder,
hypoglycemia, polydipsia, sodium
[SPEAKER_01]: imbalance, finally got genetic workup,
mitochondrial disorder with all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: variants in the genes that you can see
listed there, and I don't know that
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's a unicorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyclical vomiting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearing loss, OCD, pandas, and the pandas
oftentimes is fine until the spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then in the spring he gets pandas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have other kids that do that too,
and I don't know if it's pollen or
[SPEAKER_01]: something else that's triggering them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intestinal malabsorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also got some heart stuff going on,
and he's just a really challenging
[SPEAKER_01]: patient, and then after showing me this,
we get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all of what the mom calls
allergies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So gluten, casein, soy, antibiotics,
antivirals, and if you look, you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rash, tongue swelling, hives, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go down a little bit, you'll see
omega-3, 6, 9, EPA, GLA, all the fatty
[SPEAKER_01]: acids, severe aggression, mania,
self-injurious, regardless of dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a little nervous to give him
cannabis because of the lipophilic nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the mother was willing to try because
nothing else was working, and she really
[SPEAKER_01]: did not want to continue to give him any
more pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even, you can see, he reacts to garlic
and onions and coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, he's a real unicorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was having seizures every 20 to 30
days on average.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were clear-cut triggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they wake him up in the morning,
instead of allowing him to wake up on his
[SPEAKER_01]: own, he'll have a terrible seizure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people think it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two articles, one that says yay
and one that says nay, about the full
[SPEAKER_01]: moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mother says he has seizures around the
full moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also, I will tell you, I have the
moon app on my phone because my phone
[SPEAKER_01]: lights up around the full moon with
seizure kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did try CBD before seeing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She gave him one drop, and she said he was
horrific the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was completely manic and
self-injurious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she came to me asking for advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really reluctant to put him on
cannabis, but I wanted to try to help him,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I started him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, at the time, I didn't have
everything that we have now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I had was CBD, THC, and THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to go with THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started with one drop, and after just
one drop, I think it was per day,
[SPEAKER_01]: he went 57 days, which was longer than he
had gone in quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we continued to titrate up,
literally adding one drop at a time,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the longest he went was 229 days,
which was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's still a lot of
triggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mom keeps track.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we get 150 days, and then he'll
have a seizure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's seven days if there's
something else going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprisingly, when he got sick with COVID,
he didn't have too many seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's on a pretty high dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, we've just been titrating
up over years, 60 to 80 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: She does regular TID dosing plus PRN
dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has no side effects, and he's on two
different chemovars from two different
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that seems to be what helps him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of the art of medicine
and the evolution of following a patient
[SPEAKER_01]: over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'll share is that when CBDV
came out, which I'm going to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: next, and I'm going to pack it into a few
minutes here, we tried one drop,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he had a seizure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just decided not to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's very happy with what we have
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, this is why it's so
important for new cannabinoids to come out
[SPEAKER_01]: and for us to be able to help these kids
who are unicorns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's your targets of CBDV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, questionable activity at CB2,
but definitely GPR55.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to talk about this GABA
rundown also.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of activity at the trip
channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a patent out from 2018 that shows
that CBDV is effective at reducing pain
[SPEAKER_01]: better than CBD for both thermal
hyperalgesia and mechanical alginia and a
[SPEAKER_01]: mouse model of neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten a response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or feedback yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the trip V1 also thought to be a
target for the anticonvulsant effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look here, you can see that the
epileptic brain on the left side is
[SPEAKER_01]: showing this increase in trip channel
phosphorylation and sensitization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the epileptic brain on CBDV has
lowering of that, which tips that
[SPEAKER_01]: excitatory message to the inhibitory
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ideas was CBDV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I'm just going to mention
this one other study about CBDV lowers
[SPEAKER_01]: intestinal inflammation in mice and in
pediatric ulcerative colitis biopsy tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: where trip V1 is upregulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's the article for that if you
want to read about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was kind of thinking as I was
putting the slides together, CBDV and THCA
[SPEAKER_01]: might be a nice combination for
inflammatory bowel disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a non-intoxicating way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this just comes from that same
article showing the pathway that CBDV
[SPEAKER_01]: lowers that inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's this nice article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this came out of Italy a number of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they talk about GABA receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that CBDV recovers this idea of GABA A
receptor rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not a neurologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what that meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a deep dive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my neurologist friend here is shaking
his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I found is that in drug resistant
epilepsy, the constant seizures basically
[SPEAKER_01]: wipe out GABA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pathways are rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBDV in animal models recover this
rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty big claim there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that I am seeing that in my
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's other studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple animal studies reporting
anti-convulsant effects of CBDV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting to my end, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: A case report of a young man with
Rasmussen encephalitis in Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not familiar with that,
it's a terrible disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have terrible seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just neurodegenerative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was taking a homemade CBDV rich
preparation with significant improvements
[SPEAKER_01]: in his quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never thought to be able to graduate high
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: He graduated high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had improved verbal skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they plotted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they even measured his blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when his blood levels were high with
CBDV, he had significant improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there was a clinical trial at a GW
pharmaceutical with CBDV in adults with
[SPEAKER_01]: poorly controlled focal seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it failed to reach the primary
endpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: A study that came out in 2019 showed in
mouse models of Rett syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is like a unicorn syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually affecting females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they're usually healthy for the
first couple years of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then become quite ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a genetic disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have all kinds of social
impairments and behavior issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have odd hand wringing kind of
motions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have severe drug resistant epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in a mouse model, CBDV rescued
social impairments, short term memory
[SPEAKER_01]: deficits, repetitive behaviors,
and a hyper locomotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also restored endocannabinoid
alterations from prenatal exposure to
[SPEAKER_01]: valproic acid, which is the model for
autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at a mouse model of autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have this study that was published
last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: A phase one pediatric clinical trial from
Australia in five kids with Rett.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were all drug resistant patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: One having as many as 370 seizures a
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started with two and a half
milligram per kilo per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And titrated up in the same increment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going further than 10 milligram per
kilo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were told that it would cause
sedation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they saw this median reduction of
seizures 79% that corresponded to an
[SPEAKER_01]: overall decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: 32 seizures to seven seizures a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will tell you for families that live
with seizures, all the parents have,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't call it PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ongoing traumatic stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they never know where or when they
might have to call 911.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if their child's going to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just going from 32 to seven a month
completely changes the quality of life for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember too, less seizures mean the
brain can move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So well tolerated with no serious adverse
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is my last slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of my very long term
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was one of my first pediatric drug
resistant epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've become very friendly with the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give her respite care by going with her
to museums on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my husband won't go with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first met her, she was 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's almost 29 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's had seizures since age two
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is nonverbal.
[SPEAKER_01]: She requires full time care.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's in a wheelchair, in a diaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has to be fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what seizures do during childhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saying cannabis, we don't know enough
about it, is cruel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know enough to know that it's safe and
you have to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brings me to tears, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, highly refractory daily seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her brothers became really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: At kind of knowing the seizure was coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mom even told me when I first met
them, she said they're the ones that will
[SPEAKER_01]: grab her and bring her to her bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all kind of padded so she can't get
hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine growing up that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her two younger brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22 different anti-epileptics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing that after two, the chances of
three, four, five, six, 18, 19,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 working is really less than one to four
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she started CBD back in 2013 when it
was really hard to get and she had greater
[SPEAKER_01]: than 50 percent reduction of seizures kind
of right out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We titrated up to six milligram per kilo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's sensitive to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we went any higher, she started
having some more seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried other cannabinoids with minimal
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, she improved eye contact,
started smiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an overall wellness that the mother
said she just is well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those days, seizure-free days started
to accumulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, and I talked about
this in the medical practicum on Monday,
[SPEAKER_01]: the longer you stay on cannabinoids,
the better response you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows up to two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have an increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always prepare patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you see now doesn't mean it's not
gonna get better later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to give it a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a botanical medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It nudges.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't hit hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was able to wean one medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: No side effects with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she was still having some seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just started her on CBDV and she's
been seizure-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: The combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she's on four milligram per kilo
per day of CBDV and six milligram per kilo
[SPEAKER_01]: per day of CBD, which is still fairly
affordable for the parents and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, she looks pretty
content right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I have time for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Ben left the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead, take questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: One quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'm very humbled during this
whole experience, experiencing all this
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing experiences with everyone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very enlightening and very
inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question with a CDMA, CBDA,
a lot of letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, regarding why it's more efficacious
than others for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have to do more with the blood
brain barrier?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's... You mean CBDA or
CBDA?
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA, my apologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that if you're asking about
seizures, I think CBDV, in my experience
[SPEAKER_01]: now, and again, this is all just my
anecdotal experience, is significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: better than CBDA for seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I didn't have CBDV,
so I got to try out CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even have another child right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parents were spending a fortune on the
CBDA and we weren't sure it was making a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we weaned down on that and introduced
CBDV and seeing a much better decrease in
[SPEAKER_01]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be because it's not penetrating
the blood brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some research showing that in oil,
the ratio in plasma to brain is not very
[SPEAKER_01]: good, but that in a tween emulsion,
like something that's an emulsifying
[SPEAKER_01]: agent, that actually that can help get it
through the blood brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one product on the market that
does it, but it's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I only have one patient on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there current clinical research
studies looking at the actual numbers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spinal fluid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way of actually obtaining
spinal fluid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to get a parent to agree to give
spinal fluid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to get them to do it when you
think they have meningitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the emergency room, we do LPs all
the time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are studies that show that when
patients come in with like first time
[SPEAKER_01]: temporal lobe epilepsy, if you check
spinal fluid, there's low levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly if somebody's doing that kind
of study, might be able to check and see
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all animal models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
