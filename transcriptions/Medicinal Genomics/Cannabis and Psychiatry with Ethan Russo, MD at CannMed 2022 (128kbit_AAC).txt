[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk Lounge
here live at CanMed 2022 in Pasadena,
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Ben Amaral, host of the CanMed Coffee
Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with Ethan Rousseau, our science
keynote presenter here at CanMed 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan, great to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's lovely to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I regard this as my coming out post
pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that said, how nice is it to be
back in person at a meeting like CanMed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you hoping to get out of this
event?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's familiar but novel at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all been cooped up for a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be my first in-person
presentation, although we've made good use
[SPEAKER_01]: of Zoom for presentations all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I found out I don't have to
be there, but I certainly wanted to be
[SPEAKER_01]: there for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, what is it about an in-person
event that makes it better than,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Zoom, which we've been living
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't have the ability to
network on Zoom the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not just the meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the little get-togethers in a quiet
room afterwards or dinners together,
[SPEAKER_01]: the chance to really get to know your
collaborators, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's irreplaceable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The business really takes place between
the talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, are there any presentations at
this year's event?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you're looking forward to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Professor Mishulam,
my spiritual uncle on all this,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dustin Sulak, Bonnie Goldstein,
[SPEAKER_01]: Stacey Gruber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't mean to put you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your keynote presentation,
it's titled Cannabis and Psychiatry,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Final Frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to admit, I'm a little curious
about the final frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because certainly there must be some
additional frontiers that we've yet to
[SPEAKER_00]: conquer with cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other notable one would be the area of
obstetrics and gynecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what they have in common is these
were very commonly indications for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis-based medicine in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Historically, the literature from the 19th
century and even before pointed to those
[SPEAKER_01]: areas as being one of the areas where
cannabis-based medicine was very
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly for psychiatry, though,
it's sort of a forbidden territory yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with obstetrics and gynecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most psychiatrists are extremely
conservative, particularly about the idea
[SPEAKER_01]: of a drug of abuse, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, that can be used
therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think many of them aren't familiar
with the history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also thinking in terms of what
they've seen, which is really abuse
[SPEAKER_01]: related to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's more to cannabis than just
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the real contributions are going to
come from additional components.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just a touch of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to ask you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because obviously THC is the known
psychoactive compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that sort of essential to be used
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there are preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, there have been a couple of
randomized controlled phase two trials of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiol as an isolate in treating
schizophrenia quite effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the doses were so high, 800 to 1000
milligrams, I think that we could do a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: better with less, making it more
accessible and less expensive by having
[SPEAKER_01]: other components, particularly
cannabigerol, which I'll be talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the keynote.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a component of great promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people really haven't had access to
it, let alone knowledge of its potential.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that an example where, you know,
these additional compounds can sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: when I talk to Kevin Spellman about some
of the pharmacology of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, he explained that some of them
are almost serve as an icebreaker where
[SPEAKER_00]: they can sort of help with the penetration
of the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that an example of why the entourage
effect is so important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just one factor among many.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I named my paper Taming THC
back in 2011 because that really describes
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of what some of the minor
cannabinoids and terpenoids will do is
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the therapeutic index of THC,
making it a better, more tolerable
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to quote from your
abstract here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that the endocannabinoid system
has a critical role in neurotransmission
[SPEAKER_00]: and homeostasis of the limbic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you speak more about how
endocannabinoids and phytocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: help regulate this important area of the
brain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the limbic system are the emotional
centers of the brain, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we find is there's a very high
density of the CB1 receptor where THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoids and the mind and
two-arachidonal glycerol work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when this was established back in
the 90s, it was obvious to some of us
[SPEAKER_01]: that, boy, there's a real target there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this explains why cannabis could be so
effective for a variety of psychiatric
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, that's the foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it just becomes a practical matter of
what do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the dose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it going to be most effective?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'd like to be working on for
the rest of my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to conquer that frontier,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did want to bring up, since we're
talking about psychiatry, it's becoming a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger topic kind of in our circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a few presentations about it
here at this year's CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psilocybin and psychedelics, what role
would they play in psychiatry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, great promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a resurgence of interest in
the psychedelics, just analogously to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been submerged for some decades
because of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I'd like to be a student of
medical history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the 50s and 60s, there was some
tremendous research on psychedelics for a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of conditions, treating
addictions, particularly alcoholism,
[SPEAKER_01]: intractable depression, end-of-life
things, the same kind of kinds of things
[SPEAKER_01]: you hear now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting how there's been sort
of a transition from cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be that we've got psilocybin or
MDMA available as pharmaceuticals before
[SPEAKER_01]: there's better access to a wide range of
cannabis-based pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I'd like to emphasize is most of
the current research on psychedelics is
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on synthetics or single molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's synergy in the
psilocybin mushrooms and many of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: botanical sources of psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to focus more on those rather
than the isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it works for cannabis, it should work
in this realm as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in your abstract, you also
mentioned it here, answering one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier questions of there being a long
history of using cannabis to treat mental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some good examples of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it only goes back about 4,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the Sumerians, there was a
listing of the attributes of what we
[SPEAKER_01]: believe is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the lines about this plant was
for or against panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a 4,000 year old demonstration
of the biphasic dose response curve of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, meaning at very low doses,
it's great for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dose that's too high and induces
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a blueprint for everything that
came before and hopefully will come
[SPEAKER_01]: subsequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another highlight would be Jean-Jacques
Moreau de Tour in France in the 1830s
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote a whole book about the promise of
cannabis for treating schizophrenia and
[SPEAKER_01]: other psychiatric conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the tradition didn't carry
through to the modern day, but we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to right that historical wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in closing, before I let you go,
I'm just curious that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: given that so much of the research that
goes into medicinal cannabis is done by
[SPEAKER_00]: privately funded companies like your own,
how important is it to come to events like
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed and share that information with the
community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not all companies are going to be
as forthcoming as you and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, you have to keep some things
close to the vest in terms of development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it or not, one has to have an
intellectual property attached to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it is now, we have found ourselves at
Credo Science going into a few tangents to
[SPEAKER_01]: try and support the operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got a lot of proverbial irons in
the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the chance to network again is
fundamental here to see with whom you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to collaborate on whatever level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's got the novel extraction technique
that might be ideally suited to the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that you're trying to develop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing what the markets are, it's always a
matter of what are other people doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we either work with them or maybe
it generates a new idea you can take in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's that intellectual
interchange that's just fundamental to how
[SPEAKER_01]: science advances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's one of the things we've
noticed in the last few years,
[SPEAKER_00]: there being more sort of announcements of
novel technologies or novel methods that
[SPEAKER_00]: go on at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like to think that's the strength of
the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoyed your time in the CanMed
Coffee Talk Lounge and look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: having a great event with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
