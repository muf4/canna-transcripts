[SPEAKER_00]: I think science is emerging and growing
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the knowledge that we're acquiring
regarding cannabis is different from what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these conferences bring together
patients, scientists, physicians,
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, and every one of them brings a
different side of this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hearing the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing the physician, learning from the
scientists, and trying to put all
[SPEAKER_00]: together, give you a perspective that you
don't have in the regular conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
Thank you.
