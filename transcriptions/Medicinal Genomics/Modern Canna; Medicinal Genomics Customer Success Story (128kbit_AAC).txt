[SPEAKER_01]: My name is George Fernandez and I'm the
founder and CEO of Modern Kanda
[SPEAKER_01]: Laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modern Kanda's reputation speaks for
itself and we've built that reputation
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years not just through fast
turnaround times and good service but also
[SPEAKER_01]: by providing reliable data that our
clients can count on.
[SPEAKER_03]: When samples come to the laboratory it is
our responsibility to ensure that they are
[SPEAKER_03]: safe for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about accuracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about reproducibility and
reliability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modern Kanda was founded in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the first lab involved in rural
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the first lab to test medical
marijuana in the state of Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else that we take great pride
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our clients know that our data is legally
defensible and that it's reproducible.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an industry that's changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's constantly evolving so you have to be
nimble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be able to pivot quickly,
adjust to new rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2019 we found out that the state was
planning to require a variety of microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: analyses and so when that happened we
really needed to start looking more into
[SPEAKER_02]: what provider we were going to use,
what vendor we were going to go with,
[SPEAKER_02]: what technology we were going to go with.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time we were doing plating and we
were having a lot of inconsistency with
[SPEAKER_02]: reproducibility of data, contamination and
so we started looking at microarray versus
[SPEAKER_02]: qPCR and medicinal genomics had done the
work to understand and know these assays.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not something that every vendor
could provide and that was when we decided
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal genomics was going to be our
partner.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used medicinal genomics products to
test for microbial contaminants.
[SPEAKER_04]: In our extraction process we're isolating
the DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: From there we then tested for aspergillus
species, salmonella, shingitoxin E.
[SPEAKER_04]: coli and yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides those we also test for viruses and
gender testing through medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The important part of isolating cannabis
DNA in the process is that it serves as an
[SPEAKER_02]: internal standard and allows us to ensure
that our process worked so if there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes present we can confidently say
there was no microbes present.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big benefit over something like
plating where you're not able to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: internal control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can plate a sample and something won't
grow and you may think it's safe,
[SPEAKER_02]: however if that plating didn't work you
really don't know if the product is safe
[SPEAKER_02]: for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our favorite features of medicinal
genomics is our fast extraction process.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we have busy days and 80 to 100
samples there's a lot of work in micro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being able to streamline our process is
extremely helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using medicinal genomics in their qPCR
platforms really allows us to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: confidence in the data we're reporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows us to know for sure that that
sample is clean and no one is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: harmed when they consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of troubleshooting across the
lab with various instruments and different
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical processes for the different tests
that we do within the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal genomics has been a fantastic
partner providing technical support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very difficult to do my job
without having them in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The future of cannabis testing is here to
stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third-party testing is going to continue
existing so that people can work out the
[SPEAKER_02]: kinks and figure out the regulations and
the standardization.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it goes recreational the market is
going to be booming and if labs don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the support and the standardization that
they need they're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: handle the sample volume of such a booming
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be number one and I think that
with a partner like medicinal genomics we
[SPEAKER_02]: can do that.
