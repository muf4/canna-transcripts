[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see such a strict regime of
timetable since I've been in the army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, my name is Dr. Michael Doerr.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a family physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the last five years, I'm the
Senior Medical Advisor of the Israeli
[SPEAKER_00]: Ministry of Health in charge of the
medical cannabis unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very challenging task and very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes during those meetings,
those conferences, I find myself in a
[SPEAKER_00]: unique position because most of the
participants are physicians who promote
[SPEAKER_00]: the treatment, want to run forwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we have some participants and many
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm the only representative of the
establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not a very simple task because
I have to face from one point of view the
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians and what are the words to stop
the running horses from going too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two little EBMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as any other physician, I would like
to progress it and I'll present what we
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call this lecture with this beautiful
slide from Illegal Substance to Promising
[SPEAKER_00]: Education.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite slides is a picture of
the Mark Manuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose many of the audience are
physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still remember myself as a young
physician first night on duty being alone
[SPEAKER_00]: in the emergency ward or in the department
with a disease or medication I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember anything about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used to keep in our pockets the Mark
Manuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the picture of the Mark Manuel,
the first edition, 1899.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we have there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis used in modern medicine with a
whole list of indications that even today,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that 90% of this list is
acceptable to us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can argue with one or other,
but it's in use and was in use for such a
[SPEAKER_00]: long period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky to be in Israel and that we are
quite, we were given by the government,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say open hand, but they don't
interfere with our work, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: concerning research and deciding which
indications it should be used and in which
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost nine million population,
70,000 approved licenses, 37 active
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, that means that in the last
three months, they got the medication and
[SPEAKER_00]: they use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where comes the difference from 40% of our
patients are oncology patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even we are very, very content to give
cannabis to oncology patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't survive much and this is the
difference is the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really am very, very optimistic about
the research done by my friend Eddie Meili
[SPEAKER_00]: and others, where we have hints now that
one day cannabis will be kind of cure of
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the problems we have to face is
the usage of Rick Simpson oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could be very promising,
but there is not a real significant work
[SPEAKER_00]: to prove its value.
[SPEAKER_00]: With our system, since it is not a
medication yet, it is forbidden substance
[SPEAKER_00]: that the government allowed us to use for
medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every physician specialist within the
limits of his specialization can recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: usage of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those requests come to my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 15 physicians working for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We check that the indications are those
that were approved by the ministry and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we prepare the print the license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I work under tremendous media and
political pressure because it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: in many other places, the media are very
much excited to promote the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: usage, not just the medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a point that once after other
time, especially when I attend the
[SPEAKER_00]: parliament meetings about those subjects
representing the Minister of Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each time they ask me what about
recreational usage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my answer is the regular answer,
look, I'm a physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in charge of the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in charge of social decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You decided, you politicians decided that
alcohol is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have its price with alcoholism,
road accidents, liver problems and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You decided the nicotine is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay the price with lung cancer and
many, many other problems, blood vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I can say for sure,
if there will be a social decision to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow cannabis for recreational usage,
the social price will be less than
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is very difficult to explain to
politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very proud that we have extent
research project.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time we have more than 300
research ongoing in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 of those are clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to present some of them as much as I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know the problems, the problems of
EBM missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem of the plant being so
changeable that when you take the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and want to do a good research,
you have a difficult time to supply to the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients the same medication each time
with all its ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another problem which we face as a
physician, I hate smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the patients like it very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of our patients receive cannabis
through the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be smoking or inhaling, which I
prefer of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for this is that cannabis is
going decarboxylation and reactivation at
[SPEAKER_00]: 184 Celsius degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes a huge difference because if
you give them the cannabis sublingual to
[SPEAKER_00]: the oral mucus, it takes time until it's
influenced, 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients with severe pain,
they want the influence of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have severe pain, you want to act
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smoking or inhaling, the influence is
in less than one, two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the time of the influence is
shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: While taking through the sublingual mucus,
it can take six hours and even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ways of administrations I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the smoking, inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is now a very promising start up
using some kind of inhalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we all know the Ventolin,
the Seratite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put the cannabis on those cylinders
with a heating device inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's very interesting because
the moment the heating device is working
[SPEAKER_00]: to 184 degrees, it works very quickly and
they can use very little amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a secret that we have a
problem, not just in Israel, but I can
[SPEAKER_00]: speak about my place, of leakage of
cannabis to the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We as a physician write it to the
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use it partially or all of it and
then sell the other cannabis to the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moment you use such device like
inhalers, there's no way to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a black market value,
so it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many years we have used cookies,
but we were very uneasy with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know the exact amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient eats the cookie, feels
nothing, eats another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the third cookie, he feels it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is more important, we are afraid
of the grandchildren eating the cookies of
[SPEAKER_00]: their grandma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: The future waves of administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suppositoria, it was mentioned,
cutaneous administration, patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to mention three things which we as
physicians don't think much about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw in many places food supplements
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't believe how attractive it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asked to give a lecture in Bogota,
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't believe they need advice from
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we walk in the city, they say
they sell cannabis products, skin products
[SPEAKER_00]: in every place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you promise a woman an ointment,
she will put it on her face and become
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful and young forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are ready to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are ready to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to patronize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veterinary products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two months ago I was asked by the Israeli
zoo to allow usage of cannabis to very old
[SPEAKER_00]: orang-utang, ape.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had severe arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I'm not in charge of the
zoo, but my automatic answer was
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start a study about the influence of
cannabis on primates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to give you all the stuff
you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Future indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Mushula mentioned it,
those who had his lecture yesterday about
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotic detoxification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that there is a kind of the
same receptors for narcotics and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it could be a competitive influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mentioned two years ago in the same
forum, we had a presentation by four
[SPEAKER_00]: American football players.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told how they use cannabis after the
games because they suffer from a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: head trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one of them, I had the feeling
that he didn't get enough cannabis after
[SPEAKER_00]: the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things were mentioned so that I
don't want to spend the time through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our approval process, as I mentioned,
is that every specialist can recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: His papers comes to my office.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs to prepare the recommendation
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to add two important documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is full medical summary from his
family physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it important that me being a family
physician, I'm very aware of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the specialist, the neurologist,
gastroenterologist, they don't care about
[SPEAKER_00]: other diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many times I receive requests from
gastroenterologist, give him allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke, cannabis, large amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see in the diagnosis list a severe
obstructive lung disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can decide to give it or not,
but you must be aware of all other
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis, especially if you have severe
psychiatric predisposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The schizophrenic, obsessive disorders and
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our experience, those that will receive
cannabis, the cannabis we use today,
[SPEAKER_00]: one day I believe it will be different,
they tend to, 10% of those patients finish
[SPEAKER_00]: with hospitalization, psychiatric
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we don't know enough strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe THC, larger amount of THC,
special strains, one day will serve us as
[SPEAKER_00]: a treatment of psychiatric diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I signed the license, not that I like to
sign, not that much, especially for 37,000
[SPEAKER_00]: people a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when other physicians signed the
licenses, they were intimidated by those
[SPEAKER_00]: who were not allowed to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very small amount, but they are very,
very aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the decision was that I will be the
only one to sign it, only my name appears
[SPEAKER_00]: on those paper, and I get all the pressure
from those people, from politicians,
[SPEAKER_00]: because each patient that is not given a
permit to use cannabis is going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: media and to the politicians and to the TV
station and all those, and they used to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak and to say about me and about my
mother things that are not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have indication committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ask the committee to meet every two,
three, four months, and the procedure is
[SPEAKER_00]: that I ask the best physicians in each
field in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be psychiatry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be Crohn's disease or others?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask them to do homework to bring all
the knowledge they can get and present a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be no situation that the
Minister of Health will allow usage if the
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure professional body does not
promote it, endorse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they prepare the paper, and we discuss
it, and then it is published officially in
[SPEAKER_00]: our website as new indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oncology.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% of our patients are oncology patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It treats symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's unbelievable, because
usually we gave to those patients morphine
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the opium derivatives,
and they get constipated, vomited,
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't eat, and you give them cannabis,
and it is entirely different world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, our basic approach is that
cannabis is given only after exhausting
[SPEAKER_00]: the usual medications, but with oncology
patients, we don't ask much, and we try to
[SPEAKER_00]: give it and to allow it as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary pain, secondary pain as a result
of metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, end of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palliation, which we do try to help those
people as much and as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This continuation of treatment is quite a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is an oncology patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have as a family physician woman
after breast cancer, and she has
[SPEAKER_00]: mastectomy and chemical treatment,
Tamoxifen, everything, after five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: she's from my point of view, complete
cure, but they don't want to stop the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, cannabis, we have very,
very little addictions, almost none,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is kind of a habit, I would say,
not addiction, but use dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dependence continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daddy Mary will tell you more about cancer
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done unbelievable things about this
subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palliative treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: After treatment of adhere, we do ask not
to start with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I believe that within the next
two, three years, we will come to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point when cannabis will be the first drug
of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, it is not first-line choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only after exhausting the usual
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neurology, multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not cure the disease, but the
spasticity is a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson, the same problem, less
fasciculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tourette patients, very good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stop the movements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are afraid to give it to children,
but maybe in the future it will be done as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, they mentioned our research
about epilepsy and autistic children.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group that's doing the study about
epilepsy, they already stated more than
[SPEAKER_00]: 800 children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of the children are almost
convulsions-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% have less than 20 convulsions a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% of those children do not improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how to find them before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autistic spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group that was mentioned yesterday,
they have almost 150 patients with really
[SPEAKER_00]: good double control, with crossover study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approved the treatment for more than 600
children, and there's a fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The women come to the Ministry of Health,
and there is no place in the study
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, so they want the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to wait for the result of
the study, and we approve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something which all the physicians
are confused about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know how to make exact
diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have laboratory tests or any
imaging, but those women and 90% or more
[SPEAKER_00]: of those patients are women.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they have cannabis, they feel less
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can function.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very popular to this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the head trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gastroenterology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful work done by one of our
scientists, Dr. Timna Naftali.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had more than 1,000 patients treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was very interesting, the results she
presented was a real clinical improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gain of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Functioning a lot better, but on direct
colonoscopy, there were not much signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement of the colon inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something very, we don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ulcerative colitis and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychiatry, as you know, in Israel we have
a lot of trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trauma experience from the army,
from terrorist attacks, and also from sex
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse in the family and other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: The post-trauma, after exhausting the
regular treatments, we have about 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: patients treated once again with huge
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ophthalmology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody mentioned glaucoma here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American Society of Ophthalmologists
checked this subject and wrote a long
[SPEAKER_00]: paper about this, which was summarized in
one word, bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not work in glaucoma unless you
use huge amounts of cannabis, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Controversial issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driving under influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many cases, we don't know how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my point of view, the transportation
authorities should take the patient to
[SPEAKER_00]: make him sit behind the monitor and see
how he's behaving, because we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent drivers using other medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, I am not sure it's
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just before this lady, we had several
problems with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them usage of cannabis in
hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many hospital physicians are afraid of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the patients coming to the
hospitalization, the same in no cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I issued very specific orders in the
Israeli hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use cannabis in hospitals,
but it must be approved by your treating
[SPEAKER_00]: physician in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second thing, we don't allow
smoking in hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ask them to use the ointment,
and of course, not in public areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they must keep the stuff closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This young, this beautiful lady,
it is our usual story, that was given
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for uncertain diagnosis,
and the staff called her and asked her,
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandma, did it help you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And her answer was, look, to the disease,
I don't know, but my grandchildren are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to visit a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last issue that I had to face was
treating with cannabis during pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have enough literature about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any other works,
and I'm still from the generation that is
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember Talidomid issue,
when we gave Talidomid and then found
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves with the results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically our approach is what I
would call the Churchill's answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember, when he was 93,
he was asked, how do you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: And his answer was, considering the
alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to the pregnant women, we have no
alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opiates are worse for the newborn,
and the same and other are not allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do believe that one day we'll be able
to give cannabis, feeling a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: confident about the usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have four seconds for questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone wants to step up to the mic in
the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one minute.
Thank you.
