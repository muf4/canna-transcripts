[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is a very important event here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it's the second time this is
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing together all aspects of the field
of cannabinoids and what are the value of
[SPEAKER_00]: having this field in health-related
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to do in these minutes I
have is talk to you about how we're
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching this field and what my
connection is with the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps give you some feeling for where we
are today and where we are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I operate something called the Center
for Drug Discovery and the Center for Drug
[SPEAKER_00]: Discovery has as its mission to develop
new medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to have some tools to be able
to develop new medications and I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: almost all of our entire effort is based
on the cannabinoid system and to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: you need a variety of tools that work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do some biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do some chemistry,
making compounds, make a lot of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We clone these receptors that you have
heard of the enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We study their metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do some biophysical work and some
computations and we also do pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be used, this approach and the
tools can be used to develop new
[SPEAKER_00]: medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they can also be used to study
cannabis because using the same approaches
[SPEAKER_00]: we can study the different ingredients of
cannabis, find out what each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients does, which is really the wave
of the future, how we're going to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: more about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just THC or is it THC and CBD and
cannabis and other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all the tools to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly and you heard about this,
there's an old history here starting from
[SPEAKER_00]: China and then it came here to the West
and you see way back in England and then
[SPEAKER_00]: my good friend Rafael Mechulam who
discovered and made Delta-9
[SPEAKER_00]: Tetrahydrocannabinol 1964.
[SPEAKER_00]: So subsequently I want to point out an
important ingredient of cannabis and that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a trichome and you'll hear more about
it here, but the trichome is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: engine here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And manufactures all these ingredients,
THC, CBD, the terpenes, you've heard a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about the terpenes, they're all made here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a quick glimpse of how these
are manufactured and for those who are not
[SPEAKER_00]: really chemists or chemically oriented,
excuse me, but just follow how these
[SPEAKER_00]: things mix together because they all come
from the same ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix them differently, you get a
different array of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have cannabis with
different proportions of constituents,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, but the building blocks are all
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how these bioactive
molecules can have work in many different
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard some of them from Dr.
Mechulam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let me identify the prints of all
this situation, Delta-9
[SPEAKER_00]: Tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, which was the
beginning of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to that we didn't know very much
about what's going on there, but then a
[SPEAKER_00]: team during the late 80s, we found out
about these cannabinoid receptors and now
[SPEAKER_00]: then we had some idea how these things
operate in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the body itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course you all know what happens if
you smoke cannabis, you get an effect in
[SPEAKER_00]: the eye and the heart, all of these
details here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dryness of the mouth and of course the
heartbeat, very quick heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me spend just a couple of minutes
on how these ingredients are manufactured.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see they all start from shikimic acid,
here mixed together, they need the
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight, they're coming in here and this
is one of the big building blocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabigerol carboxylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the details here, how they
keep building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start from that and they can go all the
way to cannabidiol or they can go to THC
[SPEAKER_00]: carboxylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, what you find in the plant,
as you know, is not THC itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a THC carboxylic acid and then
the sunlight hits it or some heat or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, it drops out, the carboxylic
acid becomes THC or while smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me differentiate THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: These molecules here, all you need to do
is tie this oxygen in here, it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: from CBD becomes THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people believe that some of the
CBD you take gets transformed in the body
[SPEAKER_00]: into THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably true and that's probably
how the reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you look at them chemically,
they have a very big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is a flat three cycles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tricyclic cannabinoid structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one, this tricyclic structure is
interrupted right here and you see how
[SPEAKER_00]: they turn around each other and they form
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that difference, these
compounds appear to have very different
[SPEAKER_00]: properties, even very different way with
which they interact in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now additionally, and you may have heard
that, so THC has this tail, five carbons,
[SPEAKER_00]: very characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that the tail is very
important because if you play around with
[SPEAKER_00]: the tail and we did a lot of playing with
these things, made all sorts of things and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on, the tail is very critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make it into a seven carbon tail,
all of a sudden becomes much more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the plant also has some
ingredients that have only three carbons
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tail and they're called
cannabivirin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cannabivirin diol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cannabivirin itself, the
carboxylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has five carbons, the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is three carbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cannabivirin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it important?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like this also plays some role.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some intriguing things happening
and they've been using it with
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly where it's going to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the major metabolic pathway,
as you see here, oops,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have THC and then it gets metabolized
here, that's very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put one oxygen here, very potent,
11-hydroxy-THC, but then when you put one
[SPEAKER_00]: more oxygen, it becomes a carboxylic acid
and that is not active.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, when you do forensic medicine,
et cetera, you measure the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: delta-9-THC carboxylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you heard that from Dr. Meshulam way
back from Israel talking to us here and
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you how we found out why this THC
does its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it has some targets,
some switches and these switches are what
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the different effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to talk to you about these
switches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are really two receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them GPCRs or G protein coupled
receptors and if you look at them
[SPEAKER_00]: schematically, if you look at the,
they have these seven helices and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they have these three loops here,
three loops here, one tail on the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: one tail at the bottom and it turns out
that also another friend of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered about three years later and
that's a CB2 and what we know today that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are only two cannabinoid receptors,
the CB1 and the CB2, but they do talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They combine to produce effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work either synergistically or in
different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been very interested in these
things and we've been working with these
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually make them, we clone them and
make things with them and also you see
[SPEAKER_00]: they're distributed differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here the CB1 is distributed in all
of these places including liver,
[SPEAKER_00]: very important actually, surprise liver
and also the fat cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why CB1 has a lot of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the heat that's produced in the body,
but also the fat content of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CB2s are more in places like the
spleen and also in anything that has to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very complex picture,
but you see basically what we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard about something called the
synapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the nerve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is them and the two receptors are
sitting on the upper part of the synapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the presynaptic junction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are the two players.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to tweak them and that's
what THC does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tweaks both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works on both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the ingredients of cannabis
tweaks both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have these enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that breaks one set of these
endocannabinoids, the other breaks the
[SPEAKER_00]: other set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a chemist, you've got a lot of
different switches you can play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also when we take these cannabis,
they affect all of these switches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They affect the production of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to really learn about it in
some detail, you need to go after all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these switches to understand how they work
and to make compounds that turn these
[SPEAKER_00]: switches on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agonist antagonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is a little thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw the licks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here is the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did some work early on to see how
this receptor is turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see right here, this molecule here is
produced in the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an anamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way it turns it on, see this tail
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is helium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is helium 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tinkers that tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of this, the receptor is
turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The receptor is turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means your mouth is dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes are shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you also notice this is what we call a
phytocannabinoid right here, THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from these guys here, which are the
endocannabinoids, there are two families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there are two of them,
an anamide and twerking glycerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are sort of the princes of the
endogenous area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the only ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see these are actually molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think, for example, this molecule is
less potent than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you can make a molecule and we
have that is 100 times more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by tweaking molecules, by playing
chemical games, you can produce molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: that can do, modulate a lot of the
functions of cannabis itself, but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: endogenous compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a matter of fact, because we're
used to saying an anamide and 2-AG,
[SPEAKER_00]: the story is longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole family of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all get, but these sort of made
the good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2-AG and an anamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to make all of them and also
tag them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we come to measure the
ingredients, we have them exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them in, we put deuterium on them,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see we made all this family very
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned about these
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are made up from enzymes inside the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these enzymes are all present in the
membrane and they work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, at the end of the day,
they make what we know, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: anamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: An anamide right here or 2-AG right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these, you can't have them just
floating around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be destroyed after they do
their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are enzymes here that do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an enzyme that breaks down all
these esters and an enzyme that breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: down these amides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called FAA, fatty acidamide
hydrolase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called monoacylglycerolipase and
some other enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work with all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this is a very intriguing
enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have time to talk about it today,
but it does a lot with inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, okay, so we have now the tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do with the tools?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been spending a lot of time making
molecules, also studying the switches.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they look like with a lot of
biophysical work, that sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: For two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we want to understand what cannabis
does, how these effects are modulated if
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we want to discover new molecules
that produce good results for health
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a two-hand operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one hand, we want to accrue all the
benefits that you can get from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hand-in-hand with that, we also
produce new molecules that make
[SPEAKER_00]: health-related issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use this model, how to make these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have actually made quite a few of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an example, we've made
compounds for appetite, AM6545,
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathic pain, you heard about that,
neuroprotection, somatic peripheral pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: very interesting molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just made it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you heard that how these fight
addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have now the tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been working a lot of these,
made a lot of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them you may recognize them under
the AM number, AM251.
[SPEAKER_00]: AM, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name, Macrianas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greek name, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, how do we make these?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have some template.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started doing this with a nice
discovery which we made just very
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is we took one of these
receptors, the CB1 receptor, and made it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time made, very tricky process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very tricky business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been working a long time with my
colleague, Ray Stevens, who also is a
[SPEAKER_00]: crystallographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to show you what they look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a molecule we made right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's AM6538.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out to be a CB1 antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know exactly now how it fits right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important to us because we
could use this as a template to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and synthesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we synthesize, just don't go in the
lab and just make anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know what we're going to make
and how we're going to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives us a template then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a CB1 cannabinoid receptor
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more pictures here, more details
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using this, we could use a
computer and put these different molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: in to see how they fit in that hole there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we come to the end of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to give you a sense how you could
take cannabis and the new medications that
[SPEAKER_00]: are synthetic medications, good
medications, both of them very valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
