[SPEAKER_01]: On this episode, I had the pleasure of
talking with Dr. Kevin Spellman from the
[SPEAKER_01]: National University of Natural Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin has a wealth of knowledge when it
comes to medicinal plant, nutraceutical,
[SPEAKER_01]: and cannabinoid research, and he has
authored 29 peer-reviewed publications on
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last 30 years, he has coordinated
new product development, formulated
[SPEAKER_01]: product lines, advised on analytical and
QC guidelines, research activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and educational curriculums for industry
and universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Spellman will share his knowledge and
expertise as an instructor for our CanMed
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical Practicum, taking place Monday,
April 12th.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that eight-hour course, attendees
will walk away with practical information
[SPEAKER_01]: about clinical applications for cannabis
medicine, dosing strategies, potential
[SPEAKER_01]: drug interactions, special considerations
for geriatric and pediatric patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: To learn more, go to canmedevents.com
slash practicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin also shared a lot of his knowledge
with me in our conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topics we hit on include how the entourage
effect includes more than just
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and terpenes, how plant-based
medicines differ from single-molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals, how plants use terpenes
to communicate with each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: how high levels of terpenes can be toxic,
how a plant's responses to environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses can change their medicinal
effects, how at-home extraction techniques
[SPEAKER_01]: compare to commercial processes,
and much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to that conversation,
I want to thank this episode's sponsor,
[SPEAKER_01]: the American Cannabis Nurses Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ACNA is a nonprofit professional
nursing organization that seeks to advance
[SPEAKER_01]: excellence in cannabis nursing practice
through advocacy, collaboration,
[SPEAKER_01]: education, research, and policy
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ACNA is comprised of a network of
professional nurses across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are rapidly growing and eagerly
welcome more nurses who seek to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about cannabis therapeutics and integrate
it into their practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ACNA's annual Cannabis Care Conference
is being held virtually December 6th
[SPEAKER_01]: through 8th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to cannabisnurses.org slash 2020 annual
conference for more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I want to thank the Hemp &
Coffee Exchange for once again providing
[SPEAKER_01]: the hemp-infused caffeine boost that keeps
this podcast going.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know, hemp coffee is a
healthy, delicious natural product rich in
[SPEAKER_01]: trace minerals and nutrients providing
sustained energy without the crash of
[SPEAKER_01]: regular coffee.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, as promised, here is my conversation
with Dr. Kevin Spellman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Dr. Spellman.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really excited to talk with you
today about a topic that we've sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: touched on in prior podcasts with Dr.
Russo and Dr. Goldstein, this whole idea
[SPEAKER_01]: of the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those other podcasts, we did talk a lot
about the endocannabinoid system and how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids can affect the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that there are a lot of other
compounds in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That many researchers believe have an
additional medicinal effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I really wanted to explore that
topic with you, mainly because I reviewed
[SPEAKER_01]: your presentation that you gave at Kim in
2019 as part of the CME course,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you gave a great overview of the
entourage effect in terpenes specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really excited to bring that to
the podcast audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first I'd like to start with the basics
and perhaps you could give us a bit of an
[SPEAKER_01]: overview on the major types of compounds
that we've found in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then perhaps we can dive into a little
bit more detail in each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, let's start with that overview
in terms of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say, as we dive into
chemistry here, looking at plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really important that there's a
common adage that when you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacology with plants, you're looking
for a gem in a jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really a
misunderstanding of plant chemistry and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant physiological activity in general,
because really plants are loaded with
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of compounds, literally
thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know what the current number is for
cannabis is somewhere around four to 500,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can assure you that that number is
grossly understated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at, for example, wheat and
corn, we've got about 3000 to 5000
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents in either one of those
respectively there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should make us think those are
the most studied plants on the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: because of their importance to human diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that should make us think that these
aren't unusual plants, that all plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have, let's say, at least a
thousand compounds in them and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to three to five thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we get to cannabis or any
other medicinal plant, we really have to
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledge that there are a lot of common
constituents in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, some of the flavonoids such
as quercetin and camp for all that are
[SPEAKER_00]: already known to be physiologically
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in in pharmacology labs, they get
ignored because they're common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we already know, for example,
quercetin hits a very key site called cert
[SPEAKER_00]: six inside the nucleus of the cell,
which has profound implications for human
[SPEAKER_00]: health on the positive side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we get to cannabis,
we're looking at flavonoids that really
[SPEAKER_00]: some people have talked about,
some researchers are looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nobody's really looking at in a depth
that I'd like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still, the cannabis community hasn't
caught up with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the can flavin A, B and C are a
particular interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at stilbanoids, which a
famous stilbanoid that everybody seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: know in the natural products industry is
resveratrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to be saying that there's resveratrol,
and cannabis, there's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are stilbanoids from that same
class of compounds that resveratrol
[SPEAKER_00]: belongs to in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're of great interest,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a study in the last two
years, I think, that just really laid out
[SPEAKER_00]: further stilbanoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are only a few known with cannabis,
and now there's there's at least a half a
[SPEAKER_00]: dozen that are known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into the spermidine
alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can we can keep going in the
root, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The the fredolins, the epifredolin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of compounds that we need to
be talking about that are known to be
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologically active, and yet we're
still stuck on cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that there's not a lot to like there,
but what we're still stuck there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'll admit, some of those are
new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much familiar, of course,
with the cannabinoids and THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, and their acid versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: as well and terpenes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But stilbanoids, that's a new one for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested a little bit more to
learning a bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stilbanoids have been shown to be
anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some other some other
pharmacological activities, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: which stilbanoid we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're of great interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of, you know, a person that's
aging or an ill person or a person that
[SPEAKER_00]: just wants to enhance their health,
there's a few stilbanoids that are well
[SPEAKER_00]: known in the natural products industry
that are of great importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, coming back to resveratrol,
and again, this isn't in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's possible we may find similar
activity from some of the stilbanoids of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, resveratrol hits a target called
CERT-1 in the nucleus, and CERT-1 is known
[SPEAKER_00]: for longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: David Sinclair sold his research to,
I forget which pharma company it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might have been Pfizer, for a billion
dollars, a billion dollars, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, longevity is the human goal
here, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in these crazy times, people still
seem to want to live through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's lots to know there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But coming to the entourage effect,
so really, the question that we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: asking here, understated question,
the underlying question, is isolated THC
[SPEAKER_00]: or isolated CBD or even a mixture of the
two the same as taking a aliquot or a
[SPEAKER_00]: sample or a mouthful of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most people in the cannabis
industry would scream no, it's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I would too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is pharmacologically,
a lot of those people in that side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things are saying, yeah, well,
you know, let's get rid of all the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and just get to the active compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a misnomer in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the idea of active
compounds, there's really no clear
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific rationale that's been stated
very well to argue that plant medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: should be reduced to the reactive
constituent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was really an artifact of modern
research that started doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more and more we look at models
like network pharmacology, where we think
[SPEAKER_00]: about multiple constituents hitting
multiple targets in the body, in other
[SPEAKER_00]: words, hitting different parts of a
cellular network or a physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether we're talking tissues,
whether we're talking cellular receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we're talking enzymes,
whether we're talking inside the nucleus
[SPEAKER_00]: and tweaking transcription factors,
hitting more than one might be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what the network
pharmacology is showing, is that number
[SPEAKER_00]: one, we can reduce the dose, for example,
of THC if we have other compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: support that activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, we really need to think
about pharmacokinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if we just have an active
constituent, oftentimes that active
[SPEAKER_00]: constituent getting into the body,
getting past the gut is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you look at the data,
about one out of two, every new drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: new drug entities that are trying to make
it into pharmacokinetics into the shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: for physicians to be able to prescribe
fail due to poor pharmacokinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, what do we mean by
pharmacokinetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, what we're talking about is,
in this case, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, pharmacokinetics involves much more
than that, but bioavailability is key,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the compound can't get past the
gut, then we've got a real issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's all for naught, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you really look at the way that
plants have handled this, and let's focus
[SPEAKER_00]: it, let's do a pollin-esque, as in Michael
Pollin, let's do a pollin-esque
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective on this for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants produce these metabolites to
protect themselves, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many of these metabolites that we
would be consuming are anti-fungals,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-feedants for herbivores so that they
don't feed on a continual in a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: or anti-parasitic, or anti-viral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a plant has got to protect itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't have made it through
hundreds of millions of years of evolution
[SPEAKER_00]: without some sort of protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this protection for plants,
since they can't pull up their roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: run, is chemistry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the plant is going to deliver an
active compound, if it's produced an
[SPEAKER_00]: active compound that can protect it from a
predator of some sort, if it can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: past the membrane of the predator,
if it can't get past that gut,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's all for naught.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wasted its ATP for nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thus, it wouldn't have made it through
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what plants do is when they deliver an
active compound, you also get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff with that, a bunch of other
phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those phytochemicals assist in
bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when it comes back to pharma,
and we're looking at the fact that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: isolating single compounds, throwing it in
a capsule, and hoping that it gets past
[SPEAKER_00]: the gut, this is ridiculous, because this
is not how evolution works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolution is designed in essence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolutionarily, plants were selected to be
able to deliver these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way they delivered them was not by
making the perfect molecule that was
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacokinetic, the appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was by having other adjuvant compounds
that supported the absorption of the
[SPEAKER_00]: active compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is when we take a mouthful of
a plant, this is what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of actives in that mouthful
of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also lots of other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It assists in the absorption of the
actives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's a real key piece
that people tend to miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think you're really hitting on
a point that seems to be playing out in
[SPEAKER_01]: more recent CanMed events is sort of this
shift, or maybe it's not a shift,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this move towards sort of more
isolated compounds and to use it for more
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of specific use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of people who are more
traditionalists in the cannabis medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: space who are very much proponents of the
whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to imagine that there's
trade-offs with both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly that, as you said before,
there's so many unknown compounds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, and there's also so much diversity
between plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you really trust that you're
getting a consistent medicine to patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the argument you get from the
medical community is, well, how do we know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know how much of each compound
is in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless you've done something like GW
Pharma has done, where they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: careful and they're cloning and the
environmental conditions are exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same because they're growing indoor,
then you do get variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's look back at hundreds of
millions of years of evolution and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variability isn't a disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variability can be an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this concept called xenohormesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this idea is that plants respond to
the environment by up-regulating certain
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds and or down-regulating other
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that response to the environment
they're adapting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, when it comes down to thinking
about an organism surviving, even on an
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary level or even a short-term
level, it's all about adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we can have a situation where
the plant is up-regulating and
[SPEAKER_00]: down-regulating certain compounds that are
important for its survival, and then as
[SPEAKER_00]: humans or as other mammals or even other
types of animals besides mammals,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they consume that, then it could be
argued that whatever was up-regulated is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a signal, a signal to their
biology that something is potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: changing in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, that signal can be used to
up-regulate certain biological functions
[SPEAKER_00]: that might help an organism survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's this whole concept of
xenohormesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that variability can actually be
used as a plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Jim Duke, who is a mentor of mine,
Dr. Jim Duke, a fantastic ethnobotanist,
[SPEAKER_00]: he used to say that the body would mine
the compounds that you swallowed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go, OK, I need more of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can slough that off in our waste
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got almost enough of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really, as simple as that
sound, that's really advanced science that
[SPEAKER_00]: we haven't gotten to yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think there's certainly the
potential to regulate what comes in and
[SPEAKER_00]: what goes out in terms of our needs,
our physiological needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is already well known for certain
vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, vitamin C, we can have a
situation where if we have enough vitamin
[SPEAKER_00]: C, we just essentially slough it off in
the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, and this is well known,
high doses of vitamin C will cause loose
[SPEAKER_00]: stools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what you're doing is eliminating the
vitamin C that you can't use.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a cancer patient that could use up to
40 grams a day of vitamin C, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what exactly is going on in their body,
they're not going to lose that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get diarrhea from
high doses of vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of ways to think about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been thinking really in
simplistic terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because, honestly, if you
really look at ourselves, science has been
[SPEAKER_00]: limited to very simplistic instrumentation
until very recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Human Genome Project,
we're seeing a huge advancement in
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding real-time physiology and
what actually goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had these simple, simplistic models
where we're drawing straight lines on
[SPEAKER_00]: graphs and expecting that to reflect
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing could be further from the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a frozen snapshot in time that we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really what's going on in the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we just look at one compound at a
time and what it's doing, we really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can look at bunches of genes
being upregulated or downregulated at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time, now we've got something closer
to reality, closer to what happens every
[SPEAKER_00]: time we swallow a bolus of kale or
broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of genes are being upregulated
and downregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a report recently for reishi
mushroom or reishi mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say Ganoderma lucidum,
where they were showing 400 genes
[SPEAKER_00]: upregulated and about 20 to 30 being
downregulated when you take reishi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what's the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we use one compound at a time,
this isn't happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would argue that as old as the human
genome is, 2.5 to 5 million years,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on who you read, that we really
do have a situation where real-time
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology is very, incredibly complex and
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our simplistic portraits of what
really goes on is just mind-boggling,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when we come across with an
arrogance saying, oh, we understand
[SPEAKER_00]: completely what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Jones, just take this pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to put it out there, but it's rather
shocking just how simplistic we have
[SPEAKER_00]: treated people's bodies and their disease
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that idea of the body takes in a
plant and has a buffet of different
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that it can choose from,
and it picks and chooses what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do want to go back to going back to
the plant side of different environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, maybe upregulating different
processes and producing certain,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be flavonoids or terpenes or
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it reminds me of conversations I've
had with folks who are on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genomic side who are sort of searching for
the markers in the cannabis genome to find
[SPEAKER_01]: what genes are producing these terpenes or
flavonoids or cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if sort of the solution is
kind of a combination approach of you need
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetics, but you also need to maybe
specialize the environment to make it more
[SPEAKER_01]: suitable for producing those sorts of
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a fair thing to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, with xenohormesis,
that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about the environment having
changes in it that upregulate or
[SPEAKER_00]: downregulate certain enzymes or certain
genes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a scientific perspective,
we would want to standardize that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment so that we can understand what
was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a certain environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, what's going on is that's
what's happening constantly in our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the fires up in Oregon,
where we just had to evacuate due to a
[SPEAKER_00]: fire that came through Ashland and headed
into some small communities, destroyed
[SPEAKER_00]: 4,000 homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about the environment and
the smoke that was in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those crops, including all the
cannabis that's grown around here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a fair amount, as well as all the
hemp now, that induced gene changes that
[SPEAKER_00]: induced changes in the proteins that were
being expressed in terms of enzymes and
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the chemistry had just
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so could it be that by consuming those
plants that it might make an organism more
[SPEAKER_00]: fit to survive smoked environments?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the smoking environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Xenohormesis model,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we need to know what's being
upregulated and downregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not putting down science in the way
that we need to be able to standardize a
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what GW has done to have the
perfect remedy that's got just the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of other phytochemicals besides the
cannabinoids they want in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But reality is for medicinal plants and
for people living in a certain area and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking those medicinal plants in that
area, there's probably a huge advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't understand yet because of
the plants adapting to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the humans adapting from
the plants chemistry to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you essentially saying that,
you know, if maybe if a plant were exposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to high temperature or something like that
and it generated a response that consuming
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant, you could theoretically get
some sort of benefit in your own body?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be resistant to that heat as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's the Xenohormesis model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's probably places where that
model is weak and there's probably places
[SPEAKER_00]: where that model is strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may not be for all environmental
conditions, but think it through in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of human existence and mammalian existence
that lived on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the plants certainly
communicated coming back to a pollinesque
[SPEAKER_00]: model, the plants certainly were
communicating with the species around
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that communication was probably more
key than we think it is because we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the technology yet to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at a jungle situation and you
listen to the wildlife in a jungle,
[SPEAKER_00]: they talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not know exactly what those
sounds in terms of what kind of words they
[SPEAKER_00]: would be in the equivalent of human
language, but they know a warning sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All species can recognize a warning sound
from another species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provided they have lived together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's exactly the same kind of
model that this Xenohormesis model is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis really has this potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: All medicinal plants have all food plants
have this potential for warning us of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's coming if we pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where when we're growing in
duplicate environments, when we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to recreate the environment, indoor
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you're about to get a bunch of
letters from indoor growers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but indoor cannabis is exactly the
same environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the chemistry is exactly
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same genes are being upregulated and
downregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the message is exactly the
same every time to the human consumer that
[SPEAKER_00]: you could argue that that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also argue that that's not
necessarily for the good of the person in
[SPEAKER_00]: that environment taking that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that that struck me
when I watched that that video from your
[SPEAKER_01]: lecture at Kim in 2019 was this idea that
plants use terpenes to communicate with
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you could speak a bit
more to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the terpenes, as tired as I am talking
about terpenes and cannabis, have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: super honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still really interesting and
they're still super active.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, terpenes to me are the closest
thing we have to to pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: strength compounds in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're highly active to the point where
they can easily be toxic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, terpenes, they the way that
plants use terpenes because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, look at the term essential
oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essential oils used to be called volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essential oils used to be called volatile
oils because their volatility.
[SPEAKER_00]: These compounds, especially the mono
terpenes, but also the sesquiterpenes go
[SPEAKER_00]: off into the environment can float off a
leaf and float over to the next plant in a
[SPEAKER_00]: gaseous form and tell that plant whatever
that message is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, dear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's coming that that that deer
that's chomping on me is coming your way
[SPEAKER_00]: up, regulate some protective compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what's going on or more
robust growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been shown as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get more robust growth with with
the right signaling in the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: from different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: An experiment was done years ago with
tannins where they they took a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: herd of a mammal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget which herd it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an antelope like animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an antelope like animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they fenced it off inside this region
because they wanted to study these trees
[SPEAKER_00]: that they fed off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a certain amount of time,
the antelope started dropping dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they went and they did the
autopsies on the antelope, what they found
[SPEAKER_00]: was these plants were communicating with
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what was happening is they were
upregulating their tannins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tannins, of course, can be
incredibly useful for humans, but can also
[SPEAKER_00]: be if you consume too much of them,
can block nutrient absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these animals were dropping dead
because they weren't getting the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: they needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is this was precipitated by
terpenes in the environment that went off
[SPEAKER_00]: into this volatile gaseous phase and
reached the next plant and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, this is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they were in the same zone,
they couldn't escape because of the fence
[SPEAKER_00]: around this zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then essentially, they were in a place
where the antelope would have not
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred to eat those compounds,
but that's all they had to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they ended up passing away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, terpenes communicate between
plants to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very likely, it's been shown through
forest bathing, shinrin-ku, the Japanese
[SPEAKER_00]: call it, that terpenes communicate with
humans as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things you'll see in
humans, there's been these great studies
[SPEAKER_00]: that's called forest bathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been these great studies where
they walk people through, the control
[SPEAKER_00]: group grows through Central Park,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these studies have been done in
Germany and Japan and a few of them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll use Central Park as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the control group walks through Central
Park for whatever it is, an hour every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the experimental group walks
through a forest a regular forest every
[SPEAKER_00]: day for the same hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they find is the people that were
going through the forest upregulated
[SPEAKER_00]: natural killer cells, their immune
function is stronger, their stress
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones go down, their blood pressure
goes down, their sleep quality improves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the reason behind this,
although it's still theoretical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the reason behind this is speculated
to be terpenes from the trees being put
[SPEAKER_00]: off and the humans inhaling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we get to cannabis plant and
swallowing them, what's really great is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these terpenes tend to be
penetration enhancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like limonene, which by the way,
limonene is almost the perfect penetration
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancer for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have commonly used menthol in the
cannabis industry, but menthol is better
[SPEAKER_00]: for more polar compounds to penetrate the
skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids, as you know, are not polar
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're highly lipophilic with a log P of
around six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're going to need something to
a special kind of penetration enhancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And limonene works really well for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it as an icebreaker in the Arctic
moving through the ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, penetrating the
transdermal and the epidermal layers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids can follow limonene
through it like a ship would follow an
[SPEAKER_00]: icebreaker going through the Arctic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, very, very important compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linalol also has potentially a bit of a
penetration enhancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A beta-cariolpholine, not so much,
but as we know, beta-cariolpholine is
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly useful and important to CB2
signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of compounds to like and to love
in these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the smell too, the aroma of terpenes
there's some really bad smelling terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially oxidized ones that come out of
labs that have been using back ovens to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull out their terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they're oxidized and you
can smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell like Satan himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they're fresh, they're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also go off really quickly into
that volatile stage, just as they would in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you pick your cannabis,
a study from University of Mississippi
[SPEAKER_00]: some years ago showed that about 50% of
your terpenes would go off into the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you're losing 50% of your
terpenes within 24 hours of the drying
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that stood out to me was
this idea that menthol aids in absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that why a lot of pain creams smell
that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually, in that case, it's because
the menthol tends to be both a stimulating
[SPEAKER_00]: and relaxing terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stimulates blood flow to the area that
it goes into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does penetrate, so it goes into the
muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also is relaxing to muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why menthol is so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, unfortunately, many gyms smell
like menthol because of everybody using
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of menthol rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the cannabis industry has
followed that trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we can do better than menthol
smelt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's subtleties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like good wine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have some really fine wines that
have notes that are enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's menthol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that you said was that
you're tired of talking about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny that being in the industry
for a number of years myself, I find
[SPEAKER_01]: myself being a bit tired of it,
or at least maybe thinking or assuming
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone already knows about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the reality is when I'm
talking to friends or family members who
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't so much in the industry,
that so many consumers are blind to
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes or what they do or how they can
kind of enhance the aroma or the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a major problem with that is
that not all labs are testing for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do physicians, clinicians,
or even consumers sort of navigate through
[SPEAKER_01]: that without having that information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I come from the medicinal plant field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is to me just another
medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the tools and a lot of the
thinking that I use comes from a global
[SPEAKER_00]: view of medicinal plants and not just
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so speaking of global views,
one of the things that any herbalist worth
[SPEAKER_00]: his salt or any quality control manager
worth his salt are going to do is called
[SPEAKER_00]: organoleptic testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And organoleptic testing is just a fancy
name for taste, smell, appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to really look at
something and you're going to smell it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can really get a lot of
information from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, limonene is a really obvious
aroma in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linolol is a really obvious aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beta-cariophylline is a really obvious
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these compounds, a lot of
these terpenes, if you start to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: their smell and even their taste,
yeah, it's possible to make your way past
[SPEAKER_00]: not having analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, ideally in an industry that's fairly
unregulated and has a lot to learn still,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I would be a big fan of analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you do a lot of work training
clinicians, training physicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be doing that at CAMA 2021
as part of our medical practicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I imagine that that population is very
used to sort of straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the effect for this condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you help them sort of get used to
the idea of using a not so straightforward
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine like cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good question because I've
definitely, from being upfront and
[SPEAKER_00]: lecturing and talking to people about
this, I definitely see the lights go on in
[SPEAKER_00]: some, but the interest fade in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the real way is to talk about
it in their model scientifically so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can really get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the really obvious
things to me that I think helps a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians is realize that number one,
plant compounds are often pleiotropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, they hit multiple targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their polyvalent is another term that we
could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hit multiple targets in terms of
pharmacological definitions here I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one thing to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we've got another model where
multiple compounds can hit the same
[SPEAKER_00]: target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talked about the stilbanoids in
cannabis and I said, yeah, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's at least half a dozen known now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a dozen with the same structural
motif, the same structural skeletal
[SPEAKER_00]: framework, slightly different in terms of
add-ons of oxygens or nitrogens or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those compounds are going to be
attracted to a lot of the same proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not uncommon that multiple
compounds can hit more than can hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: same target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get this, in that sense,
you get this pharmacodynamic synergy from
[SPEAKER_00]: those two pieces, the fact that a compound
can hit multiple targets and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds can hit one target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get these potentiated
pharmacological effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think once people start to see that,
and then you lay out the network
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacology model where we look at
pharmacology as not about one target,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this has been the dogma in
pharmacology is isolation and selectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compounds got to be selective and it's
not selective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it a dirty drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing I've heard said about dirty
drugs recently was dirty drugs are drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, if you take Gleevec,
for example, a very famous pharma molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: for cancer, the reason it works is because
it hits multiple targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet it was designed, it was designed
to hit one target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this idea of hitting one target is
number one, not really very oftenly
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully achieved in pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, it goes against all
science against network pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Network pharmacology really suggests that
we need to hit multiple places,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple nodes in a network to massage or
to nudge that network towards a different
[SPEAKER_00]: order, towards a different entrainment,
if you will, because that's really what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physiology is an entrainment of patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get disease patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get a homeostasis of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can push that physiology,
if we can nudge it off of that homeostasis
[SPEAKER_00]: of disease into a healthier place,
that's ultimately what we're trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is change the pattern, the physiological
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be done pharmacologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's keep in mind, it can also be
done with exercise, with good nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: with love even, somebody's life,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Snudges can be subtle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did want to go back to one point
that you had made, going back to terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: forgive me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did say that they could be toxic at
certain levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that came up when,
again, I was talking with Cindy Orser,
[SPEAKER_01]: she expressed some concern with the fact
that some manufacturers or producers will
[SPEAKER_01]: actually add in terpenes to certain
products to kind of scary levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she was talking about percentages
that were orders of magnitude higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: what you would find in a normal plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you had any comments on
that or if that's a concern?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of comments about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, let's talk about nature,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we find terpenes in plants,
they're usually below 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's use that as a rule of thumb
that if you've got a product with more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 10% terpenes, and that's even on the
high side, it's going to depend on which
[SPEAKER_00]: there are terpenes that are highly toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're still at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at cannabis, the terpene levels
are usually about three to seven percent
[SPEAKER_00]: after looking at hundreds of C of A's on
various products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we really need to be aware of
is that we probably don't want to breach
[SPEAKER_00]: that level unless there's a very specific
therapeutic activity to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the case, the person doling
that terpene out needs to be highly
[SPEAKER_00]: trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to know what they're talking
about and they need to be super aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen data on dabs that show up to
60% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk for a second about this
other aspect of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dissolve things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So need I say more?
[SPEAKER_00]: You inhale 60% terpenes into your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potential for highly pro-oxidant free
radical production, breaking down
[SPEAKER_00]: membranes inducing apoptosis of neurons,
pissing off the microglia and the
[SPEAKER_00]: astrocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are doing this daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that we're probably going
to see some studies coming out about
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing where people that are long term
doing it really have some unusual
[SPEAKER_00]: neurological anomalies when they're
dabbing with that sort of problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just need to be super aware that
just terpenes, because they're from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, aren't super safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they're the closest thing we
have to pharmaceuticals right out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant because they're so highly
concentrated and potentially highly toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we need to be aware of not only
quality control in terms of what's in our
[SPEAKER_00]: products, but also in terms of safety data
and toxicology data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see that happening,
unfortunately, in the industry at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people have this
conception that cannabis is harmless,
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps mainly because they haven't been
able to find a lethal dose of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it sounds like, as we found out in
this conversation, there's a lot of other
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds in the plant that at high doses
could have a very deleterious effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I assure you that you can easily
find lethal doses of terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there's a famous story in the
herbal community, not the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community, about a woman in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this happened in the 70s where she
was using pennyroyal essential oil to
[SPEAKER_00]: induce an abortion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she bought a little dram of
essential oil, of pennyroyal, and she took
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: She died of kidney failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's something that the natural
products industry has been dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: ever since it's been in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only the cannabis industry is starting
to realize now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so winding down here, I did want to
give you a chance to comment on because in
[SPEAKER_01]: addition to instructing as part of our
medical practicum, I know that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be presenting as well on
different extraction techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, and you can correct me if I'm
wrong, but specifically comparing a more
[SPEAKER_01]: homestyle method of extraction and kind of
comparing it to a more commercial style of
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction to see what the output is for
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give you a chance to talk a
bit about that and maybe give us a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a preview of what that lecture will
be about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we mimicked a home
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look, there's lots of people,
with the price of cannabis that's out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, people that actually need it for a
medicine are really at a disadvantage,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if they're not making a good
wage, which unfortunately the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States is a huge percentage of the
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're seeing is people
growing it and then making their own
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really this was, we hoped that this
study would be a service to all the people
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that are at home making their
own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we did was we mimicked a
typical herbal extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a pour over technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a cold freeze technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is just mimicked making a
typical maceration, or in other words,
[SPEAKER_00]: by maceration, we mean soaking the plant
in ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a percolation where you're running it
through a percolation cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, percolation is how they
used to make all the plant, back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: days when the United States pharmacopoeia
was stuffed with herbal medicines,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what we used, percolation
was the preferred method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we compared percolation to
maceration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we compared the maceration time
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you talk to a traditional herbalist,
they'll tell you that you have to macerate
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to macerate for at least two
weeks, or if not a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not true, and I've never
believed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I was at UNC doing some
research on echinacea, which by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: has got a couple of CB2 ligands in it,
I saw this opportunity to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, I realized as I was
doing the experiment, as I was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: making the medicine, making the tincture
of the echinacea, that I had an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't really plan this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point in time, so this is a
good 10 plus years ago, I showed that a
[SPEAKER_00]: 24-hour maceration was as good as a
two-week maceration, in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: content of the isobutyl amides,
or also known as the alkyl amides,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where the CB2 ligands come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did in this study, just
recently, is we compared three minutes to
[SPEAKER_00]: one hour to two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that the hour was as
good as the two week, and the three minute
[SPEAKER_00]: was about 94% of the hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had, and this is what we're
measuring is CBD here, not terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a great, good strong data there
to show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we compared that to percolation,
and this has been an ongoing debate in
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal medicine about the strength of
percolations versus the strength of
[SPEAKER_00]: macerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's advantages to both,
there's disadvantages to both,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did a typical percolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a very significant increase in
our CBD yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not surprised by that at all,
but I think a lot of traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: herbalists will be surprised by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think that a lot of people who
are growing plants, plants at home,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it seems like every season more people
I know are doing just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they'll be very interested to see
your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm excited to show them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just winding down now, one final
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to give you an opportunity to
plug any website, social media,
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything that you'd like the listeners
to access to learn more about the work
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like to call it an audio science
journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do something called the Spelman Report,
spelmanreport.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, this month we were just
releasing a interview with Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's both cannabis as well as natural
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my idea really is to be of service to
educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully there's good information in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got an episode on COVID,
actually a couple of episodes on COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of good information there
that might be useful to your listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will put that in the show notes so
people can get right over to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Kevin.
