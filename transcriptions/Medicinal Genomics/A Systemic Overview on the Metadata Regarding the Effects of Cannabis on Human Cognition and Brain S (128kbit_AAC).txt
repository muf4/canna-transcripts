[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be discussing some metadata
about the effects of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: cognitive function.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's quite an honor to close the
conference with your presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does feel a little bit like Jimi
Hendrix at Woodstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: While people settle down, I'd also say,
you know, this is a controversial issue,
[SPEAKER_02]: what effect cannabis has on the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I encourage you cannabis users not to
take it personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, don't be so vain that you think
this data is about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'd like to say that I do have a
disclaimer, and that's largely because
[SPEAKER_02]: life has been good lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do provide consulting and advising
to businesses, the government,
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry, as well as work in academic
circles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, today I'm going to discuss a little
bit about cannabis as a factor in health.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be a good factor, it can be a bad
factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ultimately, what this data shows,
and this is a bit of a spoiler alert,
[SPEAKER_02]: so if you zone out for the rest of the
talk, this is all you really need to know,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that the younger you are, the more
cannabis you use, the more likely there
[SPEAKER_02]: will be issues associated with that use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for most individuals, cannabis does
not pose a significant health risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: There don't appear to be long lasting
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any cognitive deficits appear to go away
with abstinence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all this, what I'm presenting to you
actually is from a paper that my colleague
[SPEAKER_02]: Adrian Lee, who's a student at Oxford
working on his mathematics PhD,
[SPEAKER_02]: have compiled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a review on the metadata.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're going to just kind of go through
this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things you have to remember
is that this data is far from being
[SPEAKER_02]: predictive.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no, like, if you use cannabis,
this part of your brain will shrink,
[SPEAKER_02]: or this part of your brain will increase
in size.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lacking a lot of longitudinal
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm going to start off by talking
about some cannabis research issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: What type of data is there?
[SPEAKER_02]: We often hear this erroneous thing about
there is no research on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or certain countries produce all the
research on cannabis and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll talk about some of these
spurious correlations and why you should
[SPEAKER_02]: never use the C word when you talk about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know what that is,
you'll learn what the C word is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about some of the political and
health observations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, before we had meta-analyses,
on the effects of cannabis, we had
[SPEAKER_02]: international reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about some of their outcomes
and their impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll jump into a systematic
review of some of these studies and what
[SPEAKER_02]: they found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to share with you
quotes from researchers about their own
[SPEAKER_02]: research and what they think it means.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll end with how I learned to stop
worrying and love research on cognitive
[SPEAKER_02]: effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's start with this cannabis
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, always be careful with saying cannabis
causes anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's a therapeutic effect or a
negative effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's a good factor, bad factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Association does not equal causation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll go over a number of reasons why
this is not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the most common mistake proponents
and opponents of any sort of drug
[SPEAKER_02]: legislation or marijuana legalization tend
to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, cannabis is a factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's often associated with things,
but it is not the cause of a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's an important thing to
think about, is cannabis is a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have our pyramid of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at the very bottom, we have like case
reports, anecdotal reports from the
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation of data quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have our observational studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are often like the easiest to do,
but also are some of the weakest studies
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of they're at the mercy of their
methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you're relying on self-reporting
about cannabis use for a financial
[SPEAKER_02]: incentive, hey, I'll give you 10 bucks if
you tell me you use a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see there could be some biases in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, a lot of these studies on
cognitive function don't confirm what
[SPEAKER_02]: people are using or if they're actually
using cannabis presently or have in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is all survey based.
[SPEAKER_02]: These studies have gotten more
sophisticated recently and will kind of go
[SPEAKER_02]: through their evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless you.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the top of the pyramid, we see more
like the randomized controlled studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the very top, we have reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what a meta-analysis is, is you take
clinical data, individual clinical report,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we saw Dr. Stacey Gruber present
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be one study.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take 10 of those, 20 of those,
40 of those together, you got yourself a
[SPEAKER_02]: meta-analysis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can treat them as one study and look
for similarities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's very, very difficult,
I'll say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote this article for Nature last
month, which discussed that while there is
[SPEAKER_02]: research allowed for cannabis,
there are these terrific hoops that they
[SPEAKER_02]: light on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They light a fire that you can jump
through to be able to do cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still really, it's not legal to study
products on the market if you're federally
[SPEAKER_02]: funded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see disclaimers if you look for
them in publications about cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties would say, here's the chemical
profile of the plant, but due to
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations in this state, we cannot
publish any of the physiological data
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's still federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a fun fact, I know many people in
this room are familiar with drug
[SPEAKER_02]: scheduling, but this is a fun fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to throw this up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC actually appears in three different
scheduling categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody really knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked the FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no clear answer on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it appears in the marijuana plant,
it's a schedule one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a liquid form, by syndrosis,
schedule two.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's purified in a pill, it's schedule
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then way by itself in schedule five,
we have Epidiolex or purified CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, these are sort of the
limitations of research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't see a lot of products here that
are on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The current sort of holy grail of medical
cannabis among a lot of circles is the
[SPEAKER_02]: National Academy of Sciences report.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is really nice because it does
provide some conclusions about what
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis will be effective for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the whole three plus one,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been shown to be effective for pain,
multiple sclerosis, and other evidence as
[SPEAKER_02]: well, including a late one addition to
that was for pediatric epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also contains some associations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't say cannabis causes mental
health issues, but it is associated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a factor in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to be very careful by just getting
upset at people who say it causes
[SPEAKER_02]: psychosis or causes violence because we
lose the ability to develop studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking for extreme effects of
cannabis, you will underpower your study
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to detect those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why am I talking about associations so
much?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wrote an article for Project CBD
called Channeling and Slinger,
[SPEAKER_02]: cracks in a crackpot theory about a pot
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of spurious correlations
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just put up a few here for posterity
sake.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome to take a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are so many out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, ice cream sales increase as
do drowning deaths on the same day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ice cream sales are not causing the
drowning deaths.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be relations there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a high intelligence is actually
linked to developing mental illness later
[SPEAKER_02]: in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting straight A's in high school is
linked to developing ADHD.
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't cause it, but it is linked
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we make these correlations and
think about them, really, really think
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: High blood pressure is linked to violence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And high blood pressure isn't causing the
violence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some things to think about as
you go out in the world and are trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: disentangle some of the messaging about
cannabis, especially with what's going on
[SPEAKER_02]: with product safety concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis and its constituents are a
factor, probably not the cause,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they are present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk a little bit about,
and this is coming straight out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: paper, a review not only of the clinical
cannabis and cognition studies,
[SPEAKER_02]: but what have we seen before these
meta-analyses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, these are the commission
and academy reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Indian Hemp Drug Commissions,
which is a very short report, and with the
[SPEAKER_02]: digital access today, you can read in a
original copy of it online.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, it said there was a lot of
cannabis use going on, and people were
[SPEAKER_02]: really concerned, thought it was the cause
of violence and murders and mental health
[SPEAKER_02]: issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out that the commission concluded
it wasn't, and that cannabis use was far
[SPEAKER_02]: more widespread than anyone had ever
considered across class, across religious
[SPEAKER_02]: values, and across cultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Following up to that was the 1925 Panama
Canal Zone Report.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, they concluded a very
similar thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not the cause of all society's
bills, and they shortly briefly allowed
[SPEAKER_02]: military personnel to carry cannabis on
them because of the perception.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shortly after that, in the U.S.,
due to concerns of, this is when you saw
[SPEAKER_02]: Henry Anslinger coming rising to fame and
his ilk saying things like, you will use
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and you'll fall under the
influence of listening to jazz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say, you only have to do
something about this, and this was the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time you ever saw cannabis or hemp
being described as a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Words like addict and addiction were
replaced by immoral street user and dope
[SPEAKER_02]: fiend, and we start to see these gears
sort of turn into how people discussed and
[SPEAKER_02]: perceived it, and it was blamed for
causing a lot of societal issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: We fast forward to the LaGuardia Report,
which is, again, Fiorello LaGuardia was a
[SPEAKER_02]: beloved mayor of New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name actually literally means little
plant, and he commissioned this report
[SPEAKER_02]: done by the National Academy of Sciences
and found that there was nothing to
[SPEAKER_02]: substantiate these claims about cannabis
causing negative effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shortly after that, there was,
under Nixon, the Schaeffer Commission
[SPEAKER_02]: Report, as it's commonly known.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another beloved politician said,
you know, after doing their own research,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at all available evidence,
they said it should be decrepit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be criminalized, and it doesn't
constitute a major public health threat,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is why it ended up in schedule one
shortly after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, a disconnect between
the science and the policy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fast forwarding, I'm gonna skip one of the
National Academy reports from 1999,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the most recent one, as we know,
has shown that cannabis is effective based
[SPEAKER_02]: on looking at, you know, tens of thousands
of articles on the subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about cannabis use in the brain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm gonna go through a little bit of
a history here and take some liberties
[SPEAKER_02]: with what these people may have said a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our clinical distillation,
and then I'll share after this,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I said, quotes from the researchers
from their own articles about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Nadia Solowee, who is a brilliant
researcher, threw the gauntlet down in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1999 with her book, Cannabis and Cognitive
Functioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was really nothing available at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even used this handbook to design
studies around memory retention and
[SPEAKER_02]: reaction times of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very useful book, but it did conclude that
the weight of the evidence suggests that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cannabis does not result in any
severe or gross debilitating impairment of
[SPEAKER_02]: cognitive function, right, regardless sort
of the amount of use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now remember, these are just surveys,
people who are admitting to using
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, and they're putting them through
a battery of cognitive and IQ tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Following that study, another person said,
well, you know, there are metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: changes when we look at all these
observational reports, but there's so many
[SPEAKER_02]: discrepancies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, some cannabis users, their IQ
increases over time, some decrease.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is one of the things,
there's a very poorly done study that
[SPEAKER_02]: talks about cannabis users experiencing
eight points of IQ decrease over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the statistic on that,
it's plus or minus eight IQ points.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're the greatest increases and the
greatest decreases over time in the group,
[SPEAKER_02]: so a lot of discrepancies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pope in 2003 or 2002, I can't read it from
here, 2002, he actually threw another
[SPEAKER_02]: gauntlet down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, you know what, during
impairment, there are changes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's changes to how the brain is
functioning and how it's adapting to
[SPEAKER_02]: having a ton of THC floating around in
there, but any measurable effect in the
[SPEAKER_02]: clinic disappears after about 28 days of
absence.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot detect it through a battery of
cognitive tests regardless of the amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another researcher seemed to conclude
something similar, saying, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a small magnitude of effects here,
especially while people are using it,
[SPEAKER_02]: actively using cannabis, but if cannabis
does have therapeutic effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is an acceptable margin of safety for
a medicine like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soloway came back almost 10 years later
and said, you guys are all wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually impairment past 28 days,
but I don't know what it means because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not significant, but she really honed
in that there are effects on the brain,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they didn't seem to be clinically
impacting any of the battery of tests they
[SPEAKER_02]: would administer to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we started to see a change in 2006
with the meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: As things became more sophisticated,
equipment became more sensitive,
[SPEAKER_02]: quick following colleagues were like,
actually, we're seeing adaptive changes in
[SPEAKER_02]: the brain from long-term cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you went to Stacey Gruber's talk today,
you got to see some of that data and some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the differences when you start to drill
down are people using this as an
[SPEAKER_02]: intoxicant or as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can actually be significant changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started to draw a line a little bit
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started to see a couple of papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one, they're looking at these
effects which are associated with heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there are changes in the brain while
they are using cannabis, but there are
[SPEAKER_02]: adaptive changes in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not just seeing an across-the-board
atrophy of the brain or things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There basically starts to build up that
there is minimal evidence of these
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some researchers started to look back
through this data and about this time in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2009, they discovered that some of the
studies that had found a significant
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in the effect of cannabis on
the brain were actually looking at two
[SPEAKER_02]: sets of data that were identical from
Finland.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually had combined them as one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought it was one distinction.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh, we have two
meta-analyses, but they picked two groups
[SPEAKER_02]: and combined it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a correction there done.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, actually, there's no
differences in global measurements in
[SPEAKER_02]: brain volume and there's not a lot of
evidence there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving forward closer to our time,
there is residual effects, people have
[SPEAKER_02]: thought, but one of the things that came
up around this time was that if users
[SPEAKER_02]: reported using CBD, again, just reported.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is literally the questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you use cannabis that contains CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprisingly, these patients or users in
New Zealand did not have any cognitive
[SPEAKER_02]: deficits, regardless of how much THC
cannabis they use, which seems a little
[SPEAKER_02]: weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know anything about cannabis,
there's always a little bit of CBD in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what's doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not test any of the products the
patient were using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we start to see more refinement of
these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are, again, really thinking about
what abstinence means from cannabis due to
[SPEAKER_02]: its half-life on the body and how long it
stays there, not seeing cognitive impacts
[SPEAKER_02]: after abstinence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chronic cannabis use may or may not alter
brain structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was their conclusion from a research
study because they saw it in some people,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, they're not controlling for
things like how they're administering it,
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're using, are they getting it
from a legal market or getting it from an
[SPEAKER_02]: illicit market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it tested for things?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not even confirming if they're
actually using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times, these are confounded in
some of these studies that I'm sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: here more recently because they would go
to New Zealand and other European
[SPEAKER_02]: countries and do these studies and try and
see if they could find the same effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they call a joint in Europe and New
Zealand and Australia is not what you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: call it here in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: A joint up there is a lot of tobacco with
a little bit of cannabis sprinkled in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they controlled for that,
a lot of their effects disappeared,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in the effects of adolescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tobacco use seemed to be more highly
associated with many of these cognitive
[SPEAKER_02]: deficits, impairments, and less academic
achievement and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of researchers started to think
about what is the mechanism of this data?
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it translated?
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that this means that there isn't
a lot of causality here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be a good factor or a bad factor,
but the regular use of cannabinoids exerts
[SPEAKER_02]: structural changes in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That all seems to be temporary and
transitory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our brains are very neuroactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taken a while for people to accept
that stem cells, that's a relatively new
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the 1990s, people just thought,
hey, you had brain cells, eventually
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll lose them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we know that they get replaced by stem
cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't just start to slough off like
leaves on a tree and then you're done one
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started to look more and more at
acute THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another group found that there is evidence
for a protective effect from cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people in these studies, observation
studies, report using CBD, they don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: them performing poorly in these cognitive
tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't see the differences in brain
volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much, much less likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it gets to functional alterations,
it started to be more and more cemented
[SPEAKER_02]: that these findings are largely
compensatory for the brain to adapt in a
[SPEAKER_02]: life of swimming in THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: These changes go back to baseline or other
levels after, say, 30 days or so of use.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit more of the same,
I know it gets a little redundant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but as we come to a crash here in 2018 and
2019, people start to try and link
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to very specific changes in the
brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of issues here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're seeing things they're not
expecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're seeing increases, decreases across
the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a reason why.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get to that in just a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we think about cannabis and themes
from this metadata, I know I flew through
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to keep you guys here too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, cannabis use is associated with
changes in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is from acute use.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're impaired on cannabis,
you're probably going to perform poorly on
[SPEAKER_02]: a variety of cognitive tasks, especially
if it's just pure THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something that's been shown fairly
conclusively.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it seems to differ with
experience, tolerance, and things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about cannabis, naive user
getting exposed to THC, you will see
[SPEAKER_02]: effects less likely in people who have
used it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this stuff is far from predictive.
[SPEAKER_02]: In science, I'm always trying to figure
out how to predict things, how things will
[SPEAKER_02]: behave, what will be the outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why astronomy, Rosa Howard,
could predict the phases of the moon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really far from that with this brain
scan stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say a child who's using a lot of
cannabis is going to have this part of
[SPEAKER_02]: their brain be affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's far from predictive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have the ability to identify
who's at risk and who isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the biggest issues with this data
and why we decided to write this paper was
[SPEAKER_02]: in response to a science fiction book that
was published earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, when researchers go out there
and are trying to take hyperbolic
[SPEAKER_02]: messaging and inflammatory messaging and
just dramatic, sensationalistic headlines,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you use that to guide their research,
their data, their experimental design will
[SPEAKER_02]: be under power to find those results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you believe, say, bear with me,
a cannabis use, even a single one-time
[SPEAKER_02]: use, will cause irreversible changes to
the brain, lead to psychosis and violence,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you set up a study to find it,
you're probably going to have a really
[SPEAKER_02]: tough time finding evidence for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start to ask more subtle questions
about whether or not it's a factor and
[SPEAKER_02]: what is a good factor, bad factor,
start to drill down a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might actually generate some good
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take Adrian and I's words for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk some quotes from the
researchers about their own research.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the authors we talked about was
Grant and Kahn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, he said, current human
observations on the effect of marijuana or
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis on development are sparse and
contradictory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The result of our meta-analysis study to
reveal a substantial effect of long-term
[SPEAKER_02]: effects on cannabis is basically,
they're saying they can't find it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can read this next one,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weight of the evidence suggests that
long-term use of cannabis does not result
[SPEAKER_02]: in any severe or gross abilitating
impairment of cognitive function.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actual quote, and she's done a lot of
these observational studies and
[SPEAKER_02]: meta-analyses.
[SPEAKER_02]: The long-term risks do not, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The long-term risks for most users are not
severe and their effects are remarkably
[SPEAKER_02]: subtle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, these are actual quotes from
researchers about their papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, a lot of this is cherry-picked and
taken out of context, a skill I learned
[SPEAKER_02]: from Ethan Russo who is like the god at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've ever read any of
his work, but my gosh, is he phenomenal at
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do they see these differences in these
studies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some studies see an effect, a dramatic
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some see this impairment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the factors?
[SPEAKER_02]: In our paper, it wasn't just to unload on
these studies, but to try and make them
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that you really have to
start asking about and maybe even testing
[SPEAKER_02]: for is what are people using?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the chemotype of cannabis and how
are they delivering it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Another really overlooked aspect is
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics, especially pharmacogenetics,
the mouse cough stuff, is dirt cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rapid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can some places do it in-house.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collaborate with a sexual health clinic
in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have on-site genetic testing for
certain markers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason you want to do this is how fast
you metabolize THC could play a role in
[SPEAKER_02]: how often you use it and the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole spectrum of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Low, like people who metabolize stuff
really, really slowly and you have stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: to metabolize stuff really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using cannabis, just
conceptually, one person might be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke 20 joints a day and not feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: While one person might have a little bit
of cannabis that stays in their system a
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is defining withdrawal for
cannabis, which again is controversial,
[SPEAKER_02]: but when do you consider someone cleared
out of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: When is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say 20 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those studies, it ranged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people had no apparent cognitive
deficits that could be detected seven
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people it lasted 20 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are those differences?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also isn't a lot of longitudinal
data here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not looking at before and after
people initiate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has never happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, objective measures of use.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are people using this?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use it one time or you include it
in the study, what is the cutoff and what
[SPEAKER_02]: is a cannabis user?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see this term used without ever
being defined in a study.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the user group and it's like,
well, he used five times in the last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe his whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a user?
[SPEAKER_02]: There really is not a good discussion
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gender differences are also an important
thing to control in these studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Men and women respond to cannabis
differently and even endorse different
[SPEAKER_02]: positive and negative aspects of cannabis
use in terms of relations with their
[SPEAKER_02]: family, effects on job, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that's not often taken
into account when you lump all these brain
[SPEAKER_02]: scans and observational studies together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also say do not really rely on IQ
scores, especially don't use them alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: IQ scores and IQ testing has been misused
throughout the history of the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really got it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you noticed, but there
used to be on the IQ test for immigrants
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in through Ellis Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be given a list of names and you had
to identify which one was a New York
[SPEAKER_02]: Yankee.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was part of the IQ test.
[SPEAKER_02]: IQ tests are incredibly subjective and
based on cultural values.
[SPEAKER_02]: Complete this picture and it could be a
picture of an airplane or a pipe or some
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of object.
[SPEAKER_02]: These tests are notoriously unreliable and
they're not intended to establish
[SPEAKER_02]: someone's worth or criminality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, what an IQ test is, the only thing
I can really compare it to would be going
[SPEAKER_02]: to ophthalmology appointment and getting a
prescription for glasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the only intent and the only way
that's ever been approved to use IQ tests,
[SPEAKER_02]: really, is to identify and correct
learning disabilities, much like you might
[SPEAKER_02]: correct your vision by going to see an eye
doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also need to adjust for body size.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was perhaps the most shocking thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different people of different heights will
have different brain sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's imagine you've got a bunch of tall
people who don't use cannabis with a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of short people who do cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be like, my gosh, these cannabis
users have really small brains.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that has never been
controlled for in these studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, something else really simple,
it seems to make intuitive sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brain and body size are linked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not adjust for that in these studies,
especially small ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest one, the biggest ask I'd have
is pre-registration.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to conduct this study?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have people from the community review and
make recommendations so you can
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporate all these things I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that is one of the things you
really want to adjust in the future,
[SPEAKER_02]: is getting the idea of we live in this
community that's very accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to do a study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Post the methodology and how you're going
to do it online so that you can make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not confirming your own bias in the
vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, just to reiterate, about these
studies, THC or cannabis is not debatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does lead to intoxication.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is associated with impairment and
temporary alterations in brain signaling.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it wasn't, it wouldn't have therapeutic
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of people say, THC is not
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, it goes into the brain
and hits serotonin receptors, the same
[SPEAKER_02]: targets as anti-anxiety medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes in the brain and hits adenosine,
the same target as caffeine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It alters cognition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's improving cognition,
it's still psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's a non-intoxicating component.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, all the effects of cannabis in
terms of deficits and impairment appear
[SPEAKER_02]: reversible with time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's never been any confirmation that
there are severe debilitating conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually used some of this data to sue
the DEA a few years ago to change their
[SPEAKER_02]: website.
[SPEAKER_02]: They changed some of these things because
on their website they actually said that a
[SPEAKER_02]: single use of cannabis leads to
irreversible toxic effects, to use their
[SPEAKER_02]: terminology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in their denial of the petition to
reschedule cannabis, they actually cited
[SPEAKER_02]: other research that said there were no
lasting cognitive impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the case, we basically said,
well, which is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there no lasting impacts from cannabis
on the brain, or does a single use
[SPEAKER_02]: permanently change the brain?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about 20 points that they ended up
changing on their website.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of claims about these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main takeaway is that the clinical
impact of cannabis on the brain and
[SPEAKER_02]: cognitive function is inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could probably appreciate a little bit
more why.
[SPEAKER_02]: These observational studies are like a
Hail Mary pass to figure something out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've reached a point where they're not
really helpful anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting routinely misused in the
media, getting used to influence policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts wanted to propose putting
cannabis may cause psychosis on a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it there with the other 30 warnings
that no one's ever going to read ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they did a study.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people were late to the party
because a study came out saying that even
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced cannabis users cannot
comprehend labeling of a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: The labeling and warning labels actually
covers up useful information like dosing,
[SPEAKER_02]: dosing size, how much is in the product,
and how long the effects last for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most experienced users could even identify
the universal symbol for a product
[SPEAKER_02]: containing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: A more rational solution to this would be
to rotate the warning labels like you see
[SPEAKER_02]: on tobacco and other products versus
listing all 30 of them on a 10 milligram
[SPEAKER_02]: serving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess in conclusion, we really start to
have to start controlling these studies
[SPEAKER_02]: better and not jumping and dropping the C
word about cannabis and really fight back
[SPEAKER_02]: on anyone who talks about positive effects
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are associated, things are linked,
and things are factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, I'd say please feel free to
email me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to share this presentation and
to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've answered all your curiosities
about cannabis on the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my first time ever giving this talk,
so that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so a lot of these studies claim to look at
healthy populations, and they try to
[SPEAKER_02]: control for diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, there's a lot of these very
interesting case reports of people who say
[SPEAKER_02]: had severe muscular disorders,
who's a truck driver in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: He couldn't pass his driving test because
of muscle spasticity, and he passed and
[SPEAKER_02]: got his license with a very, what we would
call a very illegal amount of THC in your
[SPEAKER_02]: blood, like a skyrocket amount of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we have to think about the
context of use when it comes to this,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there are a lot of studies where
people who, again, if you have suffered
[SPEAKER_02]: from tremors and it improves your tremors,
that is the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with visual processing in
cannabis on the brain, cannabis seems to
[SPEAKER_02]: affect the mechanics of the eye,
but not the actual visual processing of
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Christian Saucier.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do your meta-analysis,
how do you factor in the political
[SPEAKER_01]: environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've seen it in your own slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard it a few times, I think,
in the conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is about the governor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rules that he puts in his state,
or hers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you end up with a lot of skewed
science, essentially, apparently,
[SPEAKER_01]: according also, I believe, to some of the
examples you were given.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do the meta-analysis,
do you classify politically, which gets
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously very dangerous?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do with that data?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you interpret that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, you want to start thinking
more about how do you generate scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: information that will actually influence
policy?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there really is an answer
how you factor in political information.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely tell when you read some
of these papers, like, man, they have a
[SPEAKER_02]: chip on their shoulder about this issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are implicit biases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, as humans, we're kind of
evolved to look for patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are being really lazy out there
with a lot of this data, to be quite
[SPEAKER_02]: frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, nature is lazy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Michelam said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is human nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so part of that, I think, is by not
being lazy, and by doing your due
[SPEAKER_02]: diligence around this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it wasn't the researchers who
combined the same population twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, oops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, well, hey, this is
politically good for us to show this
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was other researchers who had the
guts to step up and say, actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: you made a mistake here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's correct this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if you find a mistake in the
literature, you find a mistake out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: it happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that people just accept,
something they hear all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just don't question, it gets cited,
repeated, repeated, repeated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what it's going to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more people are being more comfortable
with taking those stances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll assume that motor impairment also
varies greatly among individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: including their abilities to drive a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also understand a breathalyzer is also
about to hit the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that technology, whatever we're
going to face, is it going to be accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are a lot of people going to be swept
up or not impaired?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we looking at in that realm?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is the use for those
devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also begs the question of,
aside from alcohol, just to speak simply
[SPEAKER_02]: about blood levels, no other
pharmaceutical drug, blood levels,
[SPEAKER_02]: do not correlate to impairment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this was the case, we'd have a
benzodiazepine and opioid roadside
[SPEAKER_02]: sobriety test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because blood levels do not correlate to
impairment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the other thing is, if you're
using a product, as you know, CBD rich
[SPEAKER_02]: with a little bit of THC, you could get
popped for the THC content of their
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not testing for CBD as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty broad stroke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the ones that concern me are
definitely false positives you might get,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially the mouth swabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you might never have touched
cannabis, but be around people,
[SPEAKER_02]: the vapor vampires or the people who just
chain smoke in cannabis, and you could
[SPEAKER_02]: fail one of those mouth swab tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think they do have their
applications in potentially looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: recent use, but there still are some
issues of how do you address the false
[SPEAKER_02]: positives and what's the goal here?
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a study with the Chemical Society
that we talked about where we suggested
[SPEAKER_02]: that the roadside sobriety test that's
already used, the horizontal gaze and the
[SPEAKER_02]: three-point turn walk, is actually more
reliable than urine or blood testing at
[SPEAKER_02]: detecting impairment for all substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could be too sleepy to drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could still be classified as impaired.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a number of reasons there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a confirmation about the substance
that people were using at the time of
[SPEAKER_02]: being impaired, that's probably its
ultimate use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think those devices have a long way
to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, law enforcement already has a
great tool that's routinely used to check
[SPEAKER_02]: for impairment and whether or not you can
drive, regardless of the reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will help anyone develop a
breathalyzer that is looking to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think their use clinically is also
potentially, in these observational
[SPEAKER_02]: studies, if you could convert quickly
whether or not people are actually using
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and participating in the study,
that'd be a great use of these devices,
[SPEAKER_02]: more so than looking for intoxication.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
Thank you.
