[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_01]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Head over to canmedevents.com now to learn
all about our CanMed 2022 event,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will take place May 3rd,
through 5th, at the Pasadena Convention
[SPEAKER_01]: Center in Pasadena, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This three-day event begins with a
full-day medical practicum led by Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie Goldstein, the practicum's
originator, as well as Dr. Dustin Sulak,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Kevin Spellman, and Eloise Thiessen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of the presenters will share the
latest research, as well as their clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: experience and practice guidelines related
to cannabinoid therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_01]: A new section of this eight-hour course is
dedicated to reviewing different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: extractions, products, and optimal dosing
for cannabinoid therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, we have two full days of
presentations and panel discussions
[SPEAKER_01]: covering the latest research in the
cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and safety testing, taking place May 4th
and 5th.
[SPEAKER_01]: The full schedule is up at canmedevents
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice that each of the CanMed
focus areas are anchored by a keynote
[SPEAKER_01]: presenter, Dr. Ethan Russo for science,
Seth Crawford for cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Bonnie Goldstein for medicine,
and Grace Bandong for safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of our keynotes, as well as many of
our presenters and panelists, were guests
[SPEAKER_01]: on the podcast, and you can listen to all
our previous episodes at canmedevents.com

[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, we welcome back Michael
Levinson, a criminal and defense attorney
[SPEAKER_01]: with 20 years of experience representing
people in all areas of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, including patients, cultivators,
retailers, and healthcare providers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We catch up on new developments in
cannabis law since last we spoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: including Ryan's Law, which requires
California hospitals providing palliative
[SPEAKER_01]: care allow terminally ill patients use
cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get into the likely reason Ryan's Law
is restricted to terminally ill patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as what hospitals and providers
will have to do to accommodate this new
[SPEAKER_01]: requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also explore the possibility that other
states will follow California's lead and
[SPEAKER_01]: enact requirements that are similar to
Ryan's Law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also talk about restrictions that
prevent healthcare providers from
[SPEAKER_01]: recommending, developing, and endorsing
cannabis-based therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The likelihood that the Moore Act,
which is a federal legalization bill,
[SPEAKER_01]: will become law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, we talk about what a more
realistic federal legalization path might
[SPEAKER_01]: look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that last one's a bit of a spoiler
for Michael's thoughts on the Moore Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with
Michael, I want to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, the Cannabis Center of
Excellence.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Virtual Cannabis Center of Excellence
is a registered 501c3 nonprofit
[SPEAKER_01]: organization that conducts citizen
science-focused population studies and
[SPEAKER_01]: programs in the areas of community
engagement, medical cannabis, adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, and social justice in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The group is currently conducting a survey
of healthcare providers' knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: attitudes, and practices related to
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a healthcare provider,
please take this 12-minute survey to help
[SPEAKER_01]: us better understand your experience with
medical cannabis, prior education around
[SPEAKER_01]: the topic, and interest in future clinical
education related to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: To learn more and to take the survey,
use the link in the show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Michael
[SPEAKER_01]: Levinson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's been a while since last we
spoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was all the way back on
episode 11 of the podcast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that episode, we talked a lot about
the legal considerations for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: providers when recommending medical
cannabis, which was a lot of great
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage everyone to go back and listen
to that episode in the archives.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since then, there's been a lot of
updates to cannabis law, and I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring you back to talk about some of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: One in particular is Ryan's Law,
which was just recently signed into law in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was hoping that you could tell us a
bit about Ryan's Law, who is Ryan,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what does this law mean for healthcare
providers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ryan was, Ryan was, unfortunately,
Ryan Bartel, who was the son of the mayor
[SPEAKER_00]: of Santee, which is a town in San Diego
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had stage four cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was pancreatic cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the later stages of his life was in
hospital or essentially hospice care,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was being given a whole lot of
opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it put him in a position where,
I mean, essentially, he was not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: live a whole lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were giving him the opioids
essentially to make him comfortable,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is commonly called palliative care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it was doing, according to his
family, was that it was making him so
[SPEAKER_00]: basically incoherent and out of it that
they couldn't talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't relate to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was breaking their hearts,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very difficult situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to have the medical facilities
that he was in allow him to use cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: so that he would be more coherent and
then, excuse me, perhaps not suffering as
[SPEAKER_00]: much pain, but it would, would not be
suffering as much pain, but would be
[SPEAKER_00]: coherent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could relate to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wouldn't be just completely wasted
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer was no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually he had to, his family moved
him to a facility in Washington state,
[SPEAKER_00]: which did allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I don't know that it was a matter
of legal wrangle, wrangling, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just found a place that would let him
do it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, initially this got started a
couple of years ago and there was some
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth about how it would be
regulated in terms of whether it would
[SPEAKER_00]: require facilities that get Medicare
benefits, et cetera, to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it would be voluntary or allow
them to do it, require them to do it if
[SPEAKER_00]: they get certain benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the governor at the time felt that
it was kind of too restrictive of
[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare facilities that were otherwise
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, he didn't sign it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they brought it back in essentially the
same form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time around, and they sort of
made it, they had to write in a provision
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically the major change was that
they kind of put in a protection for
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities that they cannot be punished
essentially if they allow this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot be restricted from getting
state Medicaid and federal Medicare and
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicaid benefits, which apparently was
not sufficiently strong in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise it's essentially the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says that healthcare facilities
cannot prevent someone from using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: as palliative care if they are a terminal
patient, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one terminal is defined as one
year of life, a prognosis of one year of
[SPEAKER_00]: life essentially from the time that the
prognosis is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't allow smoking or vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So presumably oils and inhaling like the,
you know, those tornado inhalers,
[SPEAKER_00]: those appear to be allowed under the law,
which is a very good way of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis into your system without burning
it essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the, even with vaping,
it is essentially considered burning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some form of smoke that comes
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny in a way,
and this is a little bit of an aside,
[SPEAKER_00]: but during the pandemic, you know,
you, I mean, at least I have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're home more, even though you're
working, sometimes you watch old movies
[SPEAKER_00]: and Turner classic movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see movies from the 50s and even into
the 60s, people in the hospital are
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smoking in hospital rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smoking in the hallways and
hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at this now and you're like,
it's like an entirely different universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any event, so that this cannabis
use must be allowed as long as they follow
[SPEAKER_00]: the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's in terms of not smoking,
not vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't be restricted from certain
federal benefits as a result of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's essentially what it really boils
down to is it is essentially hospice
[SPEAKER_00]: palliative care for people in hospice,
which is essentially end stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a end of life stage,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to clarify here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it that the law is saying that
hospitals have to allow cannabis use or
[SPEAKER_01]: just that they won't be punished if they
allow it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is whether health care for
facilities must allow the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to that is yes,
they are prohibited from restricting it as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as there is certain type of health
care facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the type of health care facility is
most health care facilities that receive
[SPEAKER_00]: any Medicare or Medicaid benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real quick, kind of an interesting
analogy is something called the Emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of
1986 that requires what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilizing care for any hospital or
emergency room that receives Medicare or
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicaid funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the requirement that they have
to allow this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to provide it,
but they have to allow it to be done as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as those the restrictions of not
allowing smoking and vaping are allowed or
[SPEAKER_00]: followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's I mean, that's certainly a
positive being able to allow patients to
[SPEAKER_01]: be using this medicine in that setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious if hospitals wanted to
take it one step further and allow
[SPEAKER_01]: patients to use cannabis, patients who
aren't terminally ill, are they able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they allowed to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that getting into a bit of a gray
area?
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly could if they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this law requires them to do
it, but only for hospital for palliative
[SPEAKER_00]: care for hospice patients or terminally
ill patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could certainly allow it,
which presumably was what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're talking about nationwide
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened when Ryan went to
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will you'll be hard pressed to find
any facilities that will really do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they had essentially they were
actually part of the lobbying in favor of
[SPEAKER_00]: this law so that they could say,
well, hey, you know, we're forced to we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any choice because they feel
that the terrible fear amongst health care
[SPEAKER_00]: providers is that they're going to lose
their FDA approved approval for dispensing
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription medications if they get
involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the other protection that they
have out of this lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hospital doesn't really want to
stick their own neck out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, well, dropped off by the feds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the medical field is very risk
averse, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandably so.
[SPEAKER_01]: To your knowledge, are there other states
that have similar laws like this on the
[SPEAKER_01]: books?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm aware of two.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is Maine and the other is Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually kind of beat California,
excuse me, California to the punch on
[SPEAKER_00]: this, which is a little unusual because
California usually has so far has been the
[SPEAKER_00]: leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before you pass the first medical
marijuana law, 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little I think that California
would have had it first, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but because of the quirky way that it
was worded initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the governor vetoed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I you know, it's quite clear to me
that, you know, and in his veto statement,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said, look, every part essentially said
every part of me wants to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a terrible injustice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This needs to be corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they basically corrected it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and maybe a good point there that
California does seem to be the leader in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of these laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that this has been put in place,
is it unreasonable to think that other
[SPEAKER_01]: states might follow suit?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not unreasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if the Moore Act comes in is passed,
especially then all states will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not holding out a lot of hope for
that, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the federal law that essentially
mimics Prop 64 in California and
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially decriminalizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Marijuana Opportunity
Revitalization and Expungement Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically stimulates the cannabis
business nationwide by expunging a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: records, by decriminalizing it,
and by setting up a tax structure that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of makes it incentivized for people
to get involved in this business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government claims it's going to get
all this money from taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the other big news lately in
California isn't just this hospice law,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the degree to which the black market
is flourishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has to do with the federal fact
that they frankly have overtaxed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since because it's been
decriminalized, which was certainly on its
[SPEAKER_00]: face a good thing, decriminalized entirely
for certain possession amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also reduced to a misdemeanor almost
all the offenses relating to growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: selling cannabis that used to be felonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the penalties are pretty low
and the police don't really care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of illegal growing and
selling going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they take down these,
you know, you read there's taking down
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous grow operations and the law
enforcement is saying, look, we're barely
[SPEAKER_00]: even scratching the surface of this
because we know what's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's that's another subject for
another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they think if the federal authorities
think that they're going to do away with
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market by taxing cannabis a lot,
that California is any any model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer to that is no, not not quite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't thought of that, that,
you know, decriminalizing and reducing the
[SPEAKER_01]: penalties would sort of enable the black
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're if you're it enables the
black market because it's it's cheaper
[SPEAKER_00]: basically to buy it on the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what you're looking for,
OK, if you're just looking for basically
[SPEAKER_00]: smokable flour, you know, particularly if
you that frankly, there's another fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that has been reported lately in
California, which is that use of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: did not increase when props has not
increased since the institutionalization
[SPEAKER_00]: of Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think, well, gosh, no, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many more people must be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, no, apparently not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which would imply that what you really
had, frankly, which is what probably
[SPEAKER_00]: people in this industry knew, or that is
to say people who studied this knew,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that you had a well, about 80
percent of the product is used by about 20
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the users.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so in other words, you have this sort
of relatively small group of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use this term affectionately,
but potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, there's just a certain bunch of people
just smoke pot, a lot of pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's just kind of their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's probably quite frankly,
if you looked at the liquor industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd probably see about the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 20 percent of the people use about
80 percent of the product or just people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just like drinkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then there are the
occasional users, you know, whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: parties, the occasional.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's drinkers, about 20,
maybe 20, 25 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and so those people were using it
pretty heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about cannabis now before it
was ever legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have supply lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The penalties are minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they don't really need to go to
the to the legal marketplace to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do it maybe because it's convenient
and it's less risky, which brings to mind
[SPEAKER_00]: several other issues about why really the
medical marijuana industry should be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: should be kind of flourishing better in a
in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you didn't ask me to touch on that
subject, so I won't, but I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I feel free to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we like to try to see where the
conversation leads us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the questions you put to me
was, I think you said whether doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: could recommend specific products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to that is they can
recommend them so they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I advise my clients to say is that,
you know, this particular product has been
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial to my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: My patients have told me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found that my patients have
benefited from this particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can even say a brand name.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what doctors cannot do is is profit
from at least in California, they can have
[SPEAKER_00]: no financial relationship with any
producer or seller of a cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, which is kind of wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The impetus behind it is perhaps
understandable, which but it's just wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: because the idea was like, you know,
really what it is, is it it stems from the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of almost all of these laws that
we're talking about stem from the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: really that this is all bad and wrong,
but we might allow it in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, take the hospice law.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, that was really the way that the
medical cannabis law was pitched initially
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Compassionate Use Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and part of the way was pitched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember hearing it on public radio when
it was being debated, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: before the vote advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I understandably so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they were saying was,
you know, basically, look, these are
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have really serious illnesses,
cancer, AIDS, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on their.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite frankly, they're on their way out
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you really care if they get high for a
few months before they pass away?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there was that was part of
the pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people were like, well,
no, I guess not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it seems perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that certainly that was what was used
to get Prop 215 passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not the only thing, but that was
a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you really care that much about that
for end of life stories?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well, obviously there's way more
medical medical benefit to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it also stems in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of my clients who are doctors and
friends and people at conferences I've
[SPEAKER_00]: spoken to, you know, I've asked the basic
question of them is, do you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: most doctors think that the only real
medicinal benefit to cannabis is that it
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxicates people, gets them kind of off
and therefore they just don't feel their
[SPEAKER_00]: pain or they don't care about what they're
going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost universally, they say,
yes, that is what most doctors think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, because that, you know, it's sort of
like, well, that and that really,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, is the impetus now behind this
hospice care law.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, the story of Ryan Bartel and why
it was why that law was needed is a
[SPEAKER_00]: compelling story.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and for sure, nobody thinks that
there's anything wrong with him using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's not right to just think
that that's the only benefit that it could
[SPEAKER_00]: really have.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and there's way, way more medicinal
benefit to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Persuading people gets harder,
though, when you think I think when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of sold as well, it's just,
you know, for end of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, certainly because people
think, well, you know, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, when there's way, way more to it than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back to that, getting back to
the the question of whether doctors can
[SPEAKER_00]: endorse products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you go to get certain
surgeries or prosthetics or what have you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using doctor named techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a doctor, you know,
you get the, you know, Dr. Job elbow
[SPEAKER_00]: prosthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the job surgery technique done
and he gets he well, he's no longer alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the guy that invented the Tommy
John surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well, there's a Curlin Job
clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do their surgery,
they do the curb, the job technique they
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their named prosthetics that
they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody thinks there's anything wrong
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are approved products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're approved techniques and
procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they develop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why shouldn't they get money for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's for for I think obvious,
but not so good reasons that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed in the cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doctors cannot develop a product that
they think is really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot develop a either an oil or
excuse me, a vape product or what have you
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've, you know, clinically
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their practice that they think is
beneficial, put their name on it and have
[SPEAKER_00]: it sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, obviously the going back to the
fact that that use did not increase when
[SPEAKER_00]: it was legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theory behind why doctors aren't
allowed to do that is because it goes back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the idea again that this is bad and
that we should only allow it in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doctors shouldn't be in the business of
benefiting from recommending this product,
[SPEAKER_00]: because after all, only a very few people
should really need it medically anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're afraid that if more and more
people start using this, things are just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go haywire.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, the first thing we found out is
they legalized it completely, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I mean, it's totally it's not
unlawful to possess it just up to certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts and just hyper technically it's
never been illegal to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but in California, but the point being
that it was fully legalized, use did not
[SPEAKER_00]: go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what makes you think that doctors,
you know, sort of approving the use of it
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to make it go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people that are going to use it
in, you know, to large in large degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't going to wait around for a doctor
recommendation for what doctors need or
[SPEAKER_00]: what patients need are products from
doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that are recommended that doctors
know are good, that doctors have developed
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and that really do achieve the
goals that they're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest problems that a lot of
doctors have, particularly when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the more complicated medicines for
child illnesses, is a consistent supply of
[SPEAKER_00]: the products that they think are the best
ones, the ones that work the best for the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, the ridiculous prices that
have to be paid for some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's due to the idea that it's
really based on the idea that this should
[SPEAKER_00]: be scarce.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, scarcity drives a price.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be scarce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be highly regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be, you know, this is all very
dangerous and should only be allowed in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the and the reality is it's kind of
the other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not that dangerous and it's
more far more beneficial than dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, if it's used appropriately,
I'm talking about oils and particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oils for children and largely for
children and people with cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are not dangerous and they
are they are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no reason why doctors
shouldn't be able to benefit from having
[SPEAKER_00]: their names on those products as long as
they think they're beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and B, they shouldn't be there's no
reason they shouldn't be used in
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, going one of the questions you also
asked me was whether pharmacies is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the questions you sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that whether pharmacies would stock
these hospital pharmacies would stock
[SPEAKER_00]: these products that will not happen in
California because they can only be sold
[SPEAKER_00]: through license distributors and
retailers, cannabis licensed distributors
[SPEAKER_00]: and retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not aware that any hospital
pharmacy has one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a specific license to be
a cannabis retailer from the from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Cannabis Control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be supplied by well,
more than likely the way it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: would work, actually, is if someone's
really sick and they're in the hospital,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will have someone designated as their
primary caregiver who can go to the to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis dispensary, buy it and then bring
it to them and dispense it to them there,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what they do for people when
they're home and very, very sick anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, can the hospital physician
recommend cannabis for their patients?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they don't they don't technically
prescribe it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would they be willing or able to do that
as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do they have to actually seek out a
different doctor to get it for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you don't have to be a special
designated cannabis doctor in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe in some other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in California, you do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have part of one of the things
that Prop 64 did that was passed in 2016
[SPEAKER_00]: is it said that a physician who recommends
cannabis has to be now has to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: attending physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that you have to take
responsibility for their care.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that really means is not a whole lot.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, what it was was an impetus that
the impetus for that was that there were
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, frankly, a lot of sort of fly
by night doctors that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pay me 40 bucks and I'll write you a
letter so you can get away with having
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But technically in California,
it need that the recommend it can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation or approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the approval part really goes back to
the real basis of the Compassionate Use
[SPEAKER_00]: Act, which was there's a lot of people
that were already using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they wanted to be able to have a
conversation with their physician and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the doctors, legally speaking,
all the doctor had to do was say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that person was considered a
qualified cannabis patient in California
[SPEAKER_00]: because they had an approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: It need not have been in writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still does not have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have to be in writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just has to be demonstrable if need be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This law was passed in 1996 as a defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never had to be in writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason it was put in writing when it
was was so that, well, at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: there really were no dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there was a new law that was
passed in 2004 that sort of created the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of dispensaries and collectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to have something in
writing before they would sell you
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, the idea was that you'd have
something in writing if you ever got
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped by an officer and you could show
it to the officer and maybe, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, that didn't pan out so well with
but at least gave you some way of claiming
[SPEAKER_00]: that you already had this and you could
take it to a judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, the question of,
you know, lawfully possessing an ounce of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana when you had a doctor's
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was litigated endlessly until well into
the 2000s when it need not have been what
[SPEAKER_00]: it was.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK, so I did what I did want to go
back a bit to this whole idea of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, physicians or medical
professionals having their name or having
[SPEAKER_01]: their own products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that your your analogy is
great with the with the prosthetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: the different procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about I mean, if I'm going to
play devil's advocate, what about
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they able to are they able to do that
as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there some sort of limitations
around that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that they have their names on
them, but they are allowed to endorse them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are allowed to profit from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a lot that is allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a website called, I think I'm
going to make I'm going to double check it
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, but I think it's called Dollars
for Docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, dollars for docs and it lists out
dollars for docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it used to be dollars for docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnie, Bonnie Goldstein turned me on to
it and I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just looked it up, that doesn't seem
to be right, but she knows about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a website that lists how much
money various doctors make from the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical products that they endorse.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and from the over the counter products
that they endorse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are doctors making serious
millions off of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pharmaceuticals you can doctors,
many of them can have they can have
[SPEAKER_00]: investments in the companies that make
them and sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can endorse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can recommend them to their patients
as long as they if they recommended to
[SPEAKER_00]: their patients or prescribed to the
patients, there are certain disclosures
[SPEAKER_00]: that have to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I have an investment in this
company, but I believe it's the right
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for you, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the entire pharmaceutical,
you know, selling business is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's a whole that's a subject,
perhaps for a whole nother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's anti kickback and all
those other sorts of things put in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not to mention just that,
you know, this is something that I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I maybe I'd read it, but I didn't
know it to recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they hire super attractive women
to go around to the doctors and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy their products and recommend,
you know, recommend and prescribe them to
[SPEAKER_00]: their patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the other, you know,
if you're watching old movies during the
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic, the other thing you're watching
is endless advertising for pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: medications on television.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask your doctor for and I've asked I have
friends who are doctors and clients and I
[SPEAKER_00]: ask them, do people really do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They say 100 percent they do it because I
was under the impression it would sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: be the other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor asked you what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but I mean, obviously, they wouldn't
do this advertising if it wasn't paying
[SPEAKER_00]: off for the big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, you know, ask your doctor for this
is and many of the and there are doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: that have they're allowed to have
investments in these companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not I'm not suggesting there's
necessarily anything wrong with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as the disclosures are made and so
on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they are approved medications,
you know, I guess I don't think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: anything wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it comes to opioids,
OK, I think there is a restriction against
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not supposed to have any
direct interest in opioids because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a redicting medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way in which those were sold to
physicians and the, you know, just the
[SPEAKER_00]: monumental deceptions that were undertaken
by the pharmaceutical companies to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and sell these products and the number of
people that have been harmed from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, I mean, it just pales in
comparison to anything that could ever be
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could you could, you know,
take the cannabis industry's worst abuses
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not even scratching the surface
of what's happened with the opioid
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're hopeful in a lot of ways
that cannabis can maybe help solve some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the damage that the opioid crisis has
provided.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk with several doctors who think that
there's there's a path for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's yes, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: To cure, to sort of be the stopgap or cure
addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that actually was the impetus
behind Ryan's law was to find some
[SPEAKER_00]: palliative care that was approved in
hospital use that wasn't an opioid.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first clients I had when I
started doing marijuana cases was a guy
[SPEAKER_00]: that got his knee all messed up in
Afghanistan as a soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was growing his own plants here in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got raided and he said,
he said, look, he said, this the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing this is because the VA will give
me the opioid opioids all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, but I can't do anything when I
take that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think I can barely function.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly helps my knee from feeling
better, but I just don't want to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to do a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, does marijuana marijuana probably
isn't as good for pure pain management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not quite as good as that,
but it takes enough of the edge off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can still function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking to myself, sounds like a
good plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually beat that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on medicinal use grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also cause the search warrant was bad,
but this guy had, this is a long story,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this guy only had like 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was enough for his own use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, in those days, you know,
this was post prop 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even after what we were doing,
it was commonly called Senate bill four 20
[SPEAKER_00]: total misunderstanding that you're only
supposed to have so many plants and they
[SPEAKER_00]: had to be all, they couldn't be mature and
all of this ridiculousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the police had to do was see one
plant and they could get a search warrant
[SPEAKER_00]: and raid your property and take everything
you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those days are, those days are pretty much
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me, let me correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good, except in California,
you can only grow six plants on your own
[SPEAKER_00]: now and almost, almost everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they fine you hundreds of dollars for
each plant over six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another issue, but we'll talk
about that another time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coming back to this, um, Ryan's law and
you know, it is limited to terminally ill
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, which, you know, we've talked
about some of the reasons why we think
[SPEAKER_01]: that might be the case, but does the
passage of this, um, this is sort of leave
[SPEAKER_01]: the door open and that they might expand
it to include all hospital patients at
[SPEAKER_01]: some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think, I think yes, in the same
way that, you know, even when props two 15
[SPEAKER_00]: was passed in 1996, there was a lot of
people saying, you know, they would not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily say this out loud because they
were afraid of, I always, I love the
[SPEAKER_00]: phrase from the movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Ghostbusters two when,
uh, uh, Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver
[SPEAKER_00]: are having dinner at the tavern on the
green in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fanciest restaurant in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Dan Aykroyd and, uh, the other
guy, I can't think of his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come running in and they're talking
about the slime and everything's going
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bill Murray says, boys, you're scaring
the straights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think they were afraid of scaring
the straights by coming out and just
[SPEAKER_00]: saying what they really believed,
which is like, this is step one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, there were people behind the scenes
that were saying that in 1996,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they didn't want to scare the
straights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they said, okay, you know, this is just
for the really sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then slowly, but surely it took 20
years, 20 years until prop 64 passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, prop 64 has a whole panoply of
problems that can be associated with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it functionally decriminalizes the
possession of marijuana up to certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts in California, which was something
that at least until 1996, frankly,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody really thought would ever happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always talked about when I do other
kinds of presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cite to a, an episode of the old TV
show, drag that from 1968 in which a guy
[SPEAKER_00]: says he's being harassed by Sergeant
Friday about possessing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, Oh, in five years,
when all the kids start wearing ties and
[SPEAKER_00]: working, they're going to, and get into
seats of power, they're going to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to walk into a store and to
buy it, just like a pack of cigarettes or
[SPEAKER_00]: a bottle of liquor, 1968.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it took a while, took almost 30
years from there, just to get medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stigma against it is really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, that when I'm talking about
how people think it's bad and we should
[SPEAKER_00]: just let it be used in certain
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's true that in 96 people behind
the scenes are saying, look, this is step
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they, they, there were many people
that felt that that was, this was what was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to lead to some form of full on
legalization and selling it in stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That for sure was the case with a Senate
bill four 20, which passed in two folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, 2004, which allowed for
collectives and, and essentially the some
[SPEAKER_00]: form of commerce as it related to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all had to be medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's just an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's, it's perhaps over-regulated and
there's contradictions in their laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is all true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, but by the way, just to,
I'm talking primarily about California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one difference between prop two 15,
which is the compassionate excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: compassionate use act and prop 64,
the adult use act, which is arguably the
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of period at the end of the sentence
that was started in 1996 is that prop two
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 cannot be amended by the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislature, the only way any part of
it can be changed is by voter initiative.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was a voter initiative that
said that prop 64 is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 64 was a voter initiative,
but specifically allows the legislature to
[SPEAKER_00]: amend it so that each little part,
so that it is not necessarily part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: California constitution and therefore only
changed by voter initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it means is there, the gist of
that is, and what was being said sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: frankly, you know, sought to vote shade by
the people that put that on the ballot
[SPEAKER_00]: was, okay, we don't like, there's some
stuff in here that we don't really love,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can change it through our
legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to go through this process
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know, this was the tectonic,
we're going to move the tectonic plate
[SPEAKER_00]: here by making it fully legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be some, some earthquakes
that are going to need to be dealt with
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road, but those are going to be
more manageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tectonic plate needed to be moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think even that's why normal,
which is normally, you should pardon the
[SPEAKER_00]: pun, would not necessarily go along with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, no, this doesn't have,
they really, they really debated whether
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted to support, you know,
this much restriction, this much
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction in this form of restriction,
but they got so much good out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also got the ability to change it
to the legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just through straight lobbying,
which is, you know, kind of the old
[SPEAKER_00]: fashioned way to change the law rather
than having to put everything back on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot, have the voters are not,
wouldn't they, they did a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: surveys and they knew the voters weren't
going to do another one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was going to be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, that's probably, that's probably
the biggest sort of upside in a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: the legacy of prop 64, the full on
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that isn't necessarily, not necessarily
answering the question you asked me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's no, but it brings to an
interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you, you talked about,
you know, back in 1968 where they were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about how, you know, eventually
this is going to be sold in store slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you still can't go to seven 11
and, and buy a pack of marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarettes, but you know, we're slowly
getting there, but it's state by state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but what about federally?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you touched on the more act
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if you could talk a bit more
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, what is that really?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that compare to the laws that
have been passed in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it, does this act really have a
shot of, of making it through Congress?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's been other bills like
this that have come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've gotten out of the house,
but died in the Senate is a lot more of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, or is there a reason to get more
excited about this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's, here's the, the,
what I think is the real bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is, you know, the, the Congress
passed what they've called the farm act a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to say, I don't remember exactly the
year that it went into effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: which essentially legalized the growing
and selling of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the real reason that they,
that Republicans went along with,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of which is a lot of them come from
hemp growing States.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, interestingly enough, hemp is,
you know, frankly, not a terribly prof,
[SPEAKER_00]: the margin on hemp isn't great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, I mean, it's legitimate
industry and it's got a lot of support in
[SPEAKER_00]: farm States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it passed, but the, the,
the real reason it was sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sold as being okay is because it
doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the radio ads for all the
CBD products, it doesn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are just afraid of what happens to
people when they smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they're the, the, the,
it's just the way it is, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back to reefer madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before that, there's, there is a,
somehow there's something about getting
[SPEAKER_00]: drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something about getting high
that is just too mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it's too, frankly, Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's cultural, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our culture is very much based
on alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I mean, I'm not for a microsecond
suggesting that alcohol should be illegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the health problems and driving
problems and societal problems stemming
[SPEAKER_00]: from alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even debatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: None, almost essentially none of that can
be associated with marijuana, but some how
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just scarier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scarier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what those, those people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, you know, the average drinker has
never been able to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just can't understand like,
what does this really do for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes people so incoherent and
crazy and capable of anything and blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of course, just to give you a real
quick example, example, a big part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: practice is domestic violence cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually I'm talking to the potential
client.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's telling me what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this and almost always somewhere
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question comes up, you know,
was anybody drinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, you know, I had some drinks,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can count on zero fingers, frankly,
the number of times that somebody I know
[SPEAKER_00]: of got high on marijuana and committed any
act of violence, let alone assaulting
[SPEAKER_00]: their spouse or their girlfriend or
anybody else.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm sure there are times when they
were maybe using marijuana and drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That certainly happens.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just does not affect people in the
same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driving by that's another statistic real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been as far as anybody can say,
you know, even since what nominally is the
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of marijuana in 1996,
there's been no increase in accidents
[SPEAKER_00]: relating to the use of cannabis,
no accident, no increase in arrest and
[SPEAKER_00]: convictions associated with driving under
the influence of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sitting here endorsing the idea of
getting stoned and driving a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just saying that it's really not
that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now mix it with alcohol, then you've got a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it with other drugs, maybe
prescription medications or even illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then you got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But alcohol all by itself, I mean,
forget about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too dangerous to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were asking me, I got off on a
tangent and I forgot exactly what the the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning or the more act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you would you would think you would
think at a certain level that this would
[SPEAKER_00]: be an the kind of thing that Republicans
would go for in a microsecond.
[SPEAKER_00]: States rights, libertarian, live and let
live in that regard, freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't .
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you'd think that they'd be on
board for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some that are kind of like
that, the more libertarian parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Republican Party Democrats, I mean,
which is odd because it's like with Biden,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like he would lose no voter,
no Democratic voter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he just came out and just said,
yeah, it should be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: One Democratic voter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, interestingly enough, however,
though, the Kennedy family, which you
[SPEAKER_00]: could arguably make the case that Biden is
kind of a sort of a for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_00]: phrase, a poor man's Teddy Kennedy,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's that's the kind of Democrat
he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Kennedy family is strongly
opposed to the legalization of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: up down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's there's a money issue
involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shilling for pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shilling for other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my belief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so the Democrats should just go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason the Republicans don't do it is
what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first cases I had that really
involved medical cannabis was a guy was he
[SPEAKER_00]: was somebody else actually set the case up
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this guy was on probation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question was, would the judge let
him use medical cannabis while he was on
[SPEAKER_00]: probation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we brought the doctor in and the doctor
said that he uses this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes him feel much better,
improves his health, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the judge said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judge says, you know, I understand
that using this cannabis makes him feel
[SPEAKER_00]: better, but I just can't understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should allow him to use it, why he
should be allowed to use this medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: just because it makes him feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, take a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shook your head, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, well, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine makes him feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there some other purpose?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be the idea that would be the
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember discussing this with
somebody and said, well, basically what
[SPEAKER_00]: that is, is that's the Puritan ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that still infuses its way
through so much of American society,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is you're not supposed to feel
better if you've done something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did something wrong legally
until you've, you know, purged that
[SPEAKER_00]: through out of your system, through
probation, then you can feel better by
[SPEAKER_00]: using the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or frankly, you're not supposed to feel
better unless you earn it somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you've done something hard and
positive for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what and and so what really is,
I think, at the heart of the opposition,
[SPEAKER_00]: this there is the stigma, which is
cultural, but a big that is to say
[SPEAKER_00]: ethnically cultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it's also that there is a
certain mentality in American life that
[SPEAKER_00]: says that anything good that you get,
OK, you have to earn, you have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something hard to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just considered too indulgent,
too self-intelligent to be able to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant, light it on fire, suck it into
your lungs and automatically feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you done to earn that feeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't think they ask the same
question when they hand you the bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: across the, you know, at the liquor store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's any question about
that when it comes to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching, you know, football on
television, which is nothing but a just
[SPEAKER_00]: portrayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a big party all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just have fun.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the number one product being
advertised is beer and liquor.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, which means you worked all week and
it's your day off.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just telling you what I've read about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I agree with all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but that is the that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also it's seen as unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we don't really know what people
will do when they do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Republicans who are much more opposed
to the Moor Act than Democrats and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Senate until unless they get rid of the
filibuster, which is a whole nother kettle
[SPEAKER_00]: of fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably meet a stonewall because
it'll just be seen as too indulgent to
[SPEAKER_00]: this, too left wing to, you know,
and put aside that the monetary benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: just in not having to enforce the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if they don't, they will undoubtedly
overtax it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they overtaxed liquor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a here's a good trivia point for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In during Prohibition, there were two ways
to get liquor legally lawfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was from your priest or rabbi for
sacramental purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other was you could get a
prescription for alcohol and you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is those are the the medicinal
part of it is what led to the growth of a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of major drugstore chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is also kind of the same thing with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could you can get during Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to get it legally starting in
96 was a medical recommendation from a
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when Prohibition ended, alcohol
Prohibition ended, alcohol use went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason was because it was harder
to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was easier to get during Prohibition
than it was than it has been since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that may have changed now because,
you know, California, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can buy liquor anywhere, 7-Eleven,
CVS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter for many, many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still in many Midwestern states,
which still are sort of more puritan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only buy it at state stanks,
excuse me, state sanctioned liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have much more restricted hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those all go back to, you know,
the sort of blue laws and restrict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way here in Massachusetts,
you can only buy even beer and wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not state owned or state managed
liquor stores, but you need do need to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get it at the grocery store or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and and probably until not that
long ago, they were probably closed on
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that but not in but not in New
Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone would drive up to New
Hampshire and get their beer on Sundays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I grew up in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's what everybody did
as they went into Wisconsin to get what
[SPEAKER_00]: they needed when when everything was
restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be actually, I mean,
this is really kind of the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be that local football game,
pro football games were blacked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you couldn't even if they were sold
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to drive someplace else to go
watch them if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that was true in New
England.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but within a certain radius of the of
the stadium, you had to go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the taverns right in the on the
Wisconsin border with Minnesota were just
[SPEAKER_00]: get a land office business every Sunday
because they drive there to watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: Viking games.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that that ship sailed a long time ago
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one more question before I let you go,
because I know we have a hard stop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to cut it off here or shoot
the question at me and you can edit later
[SPEAKER_00]: if need be, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, one more question before I let you go
going back to the to the Moore Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you've you pretty much dashed our
hopes there, which I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm wondering, kind of bringing it
back to Ryan's law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there do you think there might be an
appetite for something that's more focus
[SPEAKER_01]: to get federally?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I didn't mean to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what they're going to do federally
is I think the way that they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do it is they're going to do it
sort of piecemeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that they absolutely
have to do and that I think actually
[SPEAKER_00]: Republicans will go along with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually is allow banking to be used
because that is just just the the the
[SPEAKER_00]: contradiction there is so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that you have this legal
business, but you can't really use a bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just creates way too much trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that even Republicans are
going to be like, OK, we'll allow that.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I think that will come
would be something like it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that they would do it is they
would not restrict Medicare payments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would not restrict Medicaid payments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, there would be no federal
sanction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put aside criminal law, no federal
sanction for the restriction of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would say that it wouldn't affect
their DEA licenses and so on to allow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I think they'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you can't get past the idea of
palliative care in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're going to get past it
with a senator from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just ain't going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and that's what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I think that yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is legislation and legislators are
working on those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: But and they'll usually what happens to
really move the ball and something like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, there has to be some really publicly
recognized injustice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the injustice of Ryan's parents is
what it took that one sort of very
[SPEAKER_00]: identifiable, heartbreaking, obvious
injustice there is what led to that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, just people complaining,
so to speak, without some dramatic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, single case or a couple of
single cases usually doesn't get that job
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks again, Michael, for taking
the time and my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to see you out of Canada this May.

wait.
