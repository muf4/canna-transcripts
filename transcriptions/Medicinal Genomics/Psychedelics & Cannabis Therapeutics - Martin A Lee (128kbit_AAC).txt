[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, everybody, as everybody's
filtering back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to start by giving a shout out
to the McKernan brothers, Brendan,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian, and Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the prime movers of CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are an amazing trio of brothers,
an amazing group of entrepreneurial
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been great to get to know them
the last few years and to work with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: my family and theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've become good friends and
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate their invitation for me
to share some of our work at Project CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: and my focus lately on psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, you heard a lot about
cannabinoid acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, you will hear about acid and
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is sort of a revival of scientific
inquiry now into psychedelic therapy and
[SPEAKER_00]: its potential there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to focus on in this discussion
is how the endocannabinoid system actually
[SPEAKER_00]: mediates many of the key aspects of the
psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't ask for a show of hands of who's
familiar with this personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I could see the hands anyway
because of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buckle up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the classical
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the mid, in the early 1950s,
really, the classical psychedelics were
[SPEAKER_00]: grouped into three categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the tryptamines.
[SPEAKER_00]: DMT is the active hallucinogenic
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a part of ayahuasca, iboga,
roux.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the phenethylamines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mescaline, peyote, and what I'm
calling lyserjamines, LSD, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: LSD is a lysergic acid that could be
derived both from the fungus and from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, the rye fungus, and also from the
moranglory seeds and the Hawaiian baby
[SPEAKER_00]: root grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important about the early
psychedelics is how they catalyze the
[SPEAKER_00]: field of serotonin neuroscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1954, there were two scientists from
Rockefeller Institute, Woolsey and Shaw,
[SPEAKER_00]: that drew attention to the structural
similarity of the LSD molecule and the
[SPEAKER_00]: serotonin molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, this is really the beginning
of the whole discussion and the lingo that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're used to these days of
neurotransmitters and receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really where it all began in the
context of serotonin neuroscience,
[SPEAKER_00]: of which LSD played such a catalytic role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the early LSD research, and LSD was
really the star of the show in the 1950s,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least up until the very late 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really where the focus was in terms
of medical science research, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were truly two ways, two paradigms,
if you will, of looking at LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, it was really looked at as a
psychotomimetic agent, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: would mimic madness, that would create an
artificial schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gave rise to some very interesting
theories and possibilities that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: could find something that could be an
antidote to the LSD schizophrenia,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it would work for real
schizophrenia, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the 50s proceeded, that way of
looking at LSD and psychedelics was
[SPEAKER_00]: supplanted by what you could call the
psychedelic paradigm, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Dr. Humphrey Osmond who coined
the word psychedelic, and it simply means
[SPEAKER_00]: mind manifesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very neutral term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any associations initially
with the 1960s and Paisley's and Dayglow
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an appropriate term.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it meant was that these drugs were
psychodynamic and had a way of bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: up, making conscious whatever is
unconscious in almost a value-neutral way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it was useful for therapy,
it was seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the therapeutic indications,
initially what doctors got onto in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 50s was potential for LSD as a
treatment for alcoholism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Dr. Humphrey Osmond who also
was involved in that research very early
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had very good results that they
couldn't really explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was so substance abuse,
depression, and trauma were really the
[SPEAKER_00]: three areas that seemed to be indications
that LSD was potentially useful for in a
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had, from the 1950s through the
1960s, you had more than 1,000 clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: papers about LSD and psychedelics,
and they described 40,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were several international
conferences about LSD therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these were actually sponsored by
the Central Intelligence Agency in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, there was a lack of adverse
reactions reported to LSD when it was in a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled clinical setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a meta-analysis that was done in,
I guess, 2016, looking back on this
[SPEAKER_00]: research, the meta-analysis of the control
trial said that there was a demonstration
[SPEAKER_00]: of a consistent and clinically significant
beneficial effect of high-dose LSD
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened was because of the 1960s
and the association of LSD with the
[SPEAKER_00]: political turmoil during those years,
all the psychedelic research was basically
[SPEAKER_00]: put on hold and stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a hiatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really basically a political
reaction to the non-medical use of LSD in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for two decades, really nothing was
happening in terms and at least in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States in terms of research into
psychedelics and the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it started up again in 1992,
but instead of the focus being on LSD,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was supplanted by scientific research
into psilocybin, the magic mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: extract, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there really wasn't much work on
LSD since really the mid-1960s,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the work on psilocybin proved to be
very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two independent randomized
controlled trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And randomized controlled trials for
psychedelics are obviously sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging because it's very difficult to
hide from someone the fact that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been given a drug if they're tripping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, there's been efforts made
in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were two very interesting
independent randomized controlled trials
[SPEAKER_00]: that showed psilocybin had significant
long-lasting efficacy against
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer-related anxiety and depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't like you take the dose and
you feel better while you're under the
[SPEAKER_00]: influence of the drug that that effect of
the antidepressant effect, the
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-anxiety effect, lasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a 2011 study at Johns Hopkins
that reported that psychedelics can
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger mystical quantum leap type of
experiences in healthy people,
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in, again, long-lasting
sustained positive personality changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large percentage of people in these
studies rated the psilocybin experience as
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the most meaningful of their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of a, you hear that again
and again in this context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to look a little bit closer at some
of the interesting work done with
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin before we move into the
endocannabinoid system, there was this
[SPEAKER_00]: study from Imperial College.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the abstract is posted where they
actually used fMRI to analyze brain
[SPEAKER_00]: activity and the brain frequency under the
influence of psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have, this is your brain on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some of the images there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the study from Imperial College was
psilocybin for treatment-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: depression and an MRI looking at the MRI
brain waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is at Imperial College.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probed the neural correlates of
psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at the changes in brain
wave activity, changes in brain activity
[SPEAKER_00]: under the influence of psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time this was seen,
this kind of imagery for psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: A drawback of the study, there was no
placebo control for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a relatively small number of
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for all 19 patients, the psilocybin
experience was shown to be efficacious
[SPEAKER_00]: with assisted psychotherapy along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was always a talking session that
went with the therapy before and after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was important, that that was part
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for treatment-resistant depression,
for all 19 patients, a breakthrough
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the reason for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: The analysis given by the scientists from
Imperial College, they felt that what they
[SPEAKER_00]: saw with the imagery had to do with
something called the default mode network
[SPEAKER_00]: of the brain, which is not so much a brain
area as a bunch of areas and a circuitry
[SPEAKER_00]: between the areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost like that's what's going
on when you're on automatic pilot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's said to be the neurological basis for
the self.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be an overstatement,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they found was that under the
influence of psilocybin, the default mode
[SPEAKER_00]: network was basically suspended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something else was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great deal of activity when
ordinarily there wouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a follow-up study,
a follow-up analysis of all the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: six months later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they found the antidepressant
effects lasted all this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, they used ultimately two
doses in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this long-lasting effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of this study and others,
the FDA has actually fast-tracked
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin as a treatment for
treatment-resistant depression,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is quite exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in progress, and we might see
psilocybin approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there are some caveats there with who
would get the approval and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, so that's what they saw,
and that's what they've seen in other
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like there's been extensive
research with psilocybin since 1992,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it started again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's enough to really, you know,
raise a great deal of interest and hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to switch gears a little bit and
talk about ketamine, another hallucinogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts as a psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ketamine already is widely used as an
antidepressant, off-label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ketamine is an FDA-approved drug,
but not for depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's approved as a dissociative
anesthetic, as a painkiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a couple of papers
published within the last two years that
[SPEAKER_00]: show that the painkilling effects of
ketamine, both in terms of central and
[SPEAKER_00]: peripheral-based pain, are both mediated
through the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's enough compelling
evidence to show that the antidepressant
[SPEAKER_00]: effect from ketamine is also mediated by
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go into that for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about the treatment
centers that have popped up all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place now that people can get a ketamine
treatment, again, they're finding that the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of the antidepressant effects last
more than just the drug itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will last for a week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people who are suffering from
refractory depression, this is a godsend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is that they found in the
research that the endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: actually will potentiate the effect of
ketamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way this is working, and this is
actually, I'll leave my glasses for this
[SPEAKER_00]: one, but you could see the title of the
abstract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's focusing on how the interplay between
cannabinoids and the NMR MDA glutamate
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That glutamate receptor is actually an ion
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what ketamine does is it blocks this
ion channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of doing that,
it triggers the release of something
[SPEAKER_00]: called brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And BNDF has been described as fertilizer
for the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does, it stimulates
neurogenesis, the creation of new brain
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, in particular areas of the brain,
which happens into adulthood, actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what ketamine does, it sort of boosts
this effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just for neurogenesis,
but neuroplasticity and synaptogenesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the growth of new dendrites on a
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects
involve enhanced BDNF-induced neurogenesis
[SPEAKER_00]: and synaptogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one study that showed that a 10
milligram per kilogram dose of ketamine
[SPEAKER_00]: produced a robust increase in dendritic
spine density, meaning the growth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dendrites on the cell, and the prefrontal
cortex of rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at this a little bit closer,
BDNF and the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately I cannot read very well,
but on the cellular level, the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system regulates the expression of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor on a
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have going on here is ketamine,
which is stimulating a brain-derived
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotrophic factor, and that process is
regulated by the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this paper shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: To explore this a little more,
let's look at endocannabinoid system in
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know from the various research is
that the endocannabinoid signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: actually choreographs the creation of the
nervous system and the brain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's involved in regulating the process
of creating brain cells and neurons,
[SPEAKER_00]: literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that process, while it drops off
significantly after birth, it does
[SPEAKER_00]: continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two what's called neurogenic
niches in the brain, in the hippocampus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the subgranular zone of the
dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lateral ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the two areas in the hippocampus
that have identified as the areas where
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons are created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are areas of the brain that are
heavily populated by cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been shown that an activation of
the CB1 receptor in the brain actually
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulates neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also shown that CB2 receptors in
the brain, and there's some controversy if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're generally in the brain,
CB2, if they only emerge when you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: injury or when you need it to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that the CB2 receptor, the CB2
cannabinoid receptor drives neurogenesis
[SPEAKER_00]: and improves functional outcome after a
stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been shown that a
pharmacological blockage, if they give a
[SPEAKER_00]: drug that will block the cannabinoid
receptors from acting, or if they create
[SPEAKER_00]: mice that they have the cannabinoid
receptors deleted, that results in
[SPEAKER_00]: impaired neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chronic stress depletes neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: FA, which is the enzyme that breaks down
cannabinoid, if you inhibit FA,
[SPEAKER_00]: it results in an increase in neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've determined this in various
ways, what's going on, the scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neurogenic activity is most robust,
at least after the child is born,
[SPEAKER_00]: during childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to decline over age, and it can
decline to the point of no activity in an
[SPEAKER_00]: elderly person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gradual reduction in new brain
cells creation has been linked to
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive decline and neurogenetic
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exercise, enriched environment,
mental engagement, intermittent fasting
[SPEAKER_00]: and a good night's sleep, all those boost
neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is a process that's
continually happening in our brains to one
[SPEAKER_00]: degree or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are certain things that will
boost that process, and it turns out that
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic drugs do as well, as I'll show
in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So neurogenesis in particular areas of the
hippocampus, but neuroplasticity
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout much of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the endocannabinoid system regulates
neuroplasticity throughout the brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the striatum, where various
forms of bidirectional
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid-mediated plasticity occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is what the science is
showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic
plasticity within the hippocampus is well
[SPEAKER_00]: documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synaptic plasticity, basically what that
means is changes in the strength between
[SPEAKER_00]: the neurons themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long-term potentiation involves
strengthening connections between neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long-term depression in the hippocampus
basically means weakening those
[SPEAKER_00]: connections, or that's how we literally
clear memory in the hippocampus through a
[SPEAKER_00]: process known as long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depression, we don't need to remember
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that are important now,
we might gradually those.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Mishulam says, nature is stingy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't need it, we don't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not using those memories or
relying them, they fade away as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So endocannabinoid signaling facilitates
adaptive learning, the brain's ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: make new neural connections and correct
abnormalities from chronic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the CB1 receptors, the
cannabinoid receptors in the brain that
[SPEAKER_00]: mediate changes in synaptic plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been shown that CB1 knockout mice
have reduced dendritic activity within the
[SPEAKER_00]: prefrontal cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it all ends up saying the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at substance abuse,
as we recall now with LSD and the early
[SPEAKER_00]: research, substance abuse, alcoholism,
was something that showed a great deal of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential in terms of what the
psychedelics maybe could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been interesting work on
endocannabinoid system in substance abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one study from 2011,
endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic
[SPEAKER_00]: plasticity and addiction-related behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: To look at this a little more closely in
terms of alcoholism and neurogenesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've learned is that substance abuse
causes a disruption in the synaptic
[SPEAKER_00]: plasticity of the brain circuits involved
in addiction with the alteration of normal
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid activity playing a very
important role.
[SPEAKER_00]: A chronic alcohol exposure reduces
endocannabinoid activity and disrupts
[SPEAKER_00]: adult neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the endocannabinoid system is one of
the most relevant biochemical systems
[SPEAKER_00]: mediating alcohol addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adult hippocampus, hippocampal
neurogenesis is a key factor involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: drug abuse, and it may provide a new
strategy for the treatment of alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction and dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of depression, neuronal atrophy
is related to depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plasticity, you can think of it as
plasticity is a sign of health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dendritic atrophy is a sign of a waning
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loss of dendritic spines in the prefrontal
cortex is a hallmark of depression and
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropsychiatric disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: A neuronal atrophy is a contributing
factor to various mood disorders,
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: The behavioral effects of some of the
standard antidepressants are contingent on
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis,
and they work by promoting neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And facilitation of neurogenesis could be
considered a treatment strategy for
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical depression and for various
neurological diseases like Alzheimer's,
[SPEAKER_00]: MS, Parkinson's, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out THC promotes neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC enhances neurogenesis in hippocampus,
improving cognitive function of rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC stimulates the creation of new brain
cells by activating CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC administration promotes the
upregulation of BDNF gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And THC enhanced the markers involved in
all stages of the neurogenesis mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I think it was Dustin pointed out
earlier today, ultra-low doses of THC have
[SPEAKER_00]: actually been proposed as a possible
remedy for brain injuries and age-related
[SPEAKER_00]: brain decline, ultra-low doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is also neurogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD induces a rapid and sustained
antidepressant effect through increased
[SPEAKER_00]: BDNF signaling and synaptogenesis in the
prefrontal cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pro-neurogenic effects of CBD might
explain some of the positive therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: features of CBD-based compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD attenuates the decrease in hippocampal
neurogenesis and dendrite spine density
[SPEAKER_00]: induced by chronic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is interesting, low doses of CBD
increase cell proliferation and
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis while higher doses decrease
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go back again to what people have been
talking about at this conference in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of dosing, that oftentimes less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would seem to be the case in
terms of CBD and neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a paper that came out last
year by scientists from the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: California, Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can read the title of the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychedelics promote structural and
functional neuroplasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go into this a little bit more,
psychedelics not just promoting
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroplasticity, but neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the way they work and
that's part of how they confer an
[SPEAKER_00]: antidepressant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So classical psychedelics up-regulate BDNF
and promote enhanced neurogenesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: synaptic plasticity even more so than
ketamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychedelics promote changes in the neural
structure and dendritic growth across
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebrate and invertebrate species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means it's through an
evolutionary concern mechanism,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that we've needed for
millions of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's very important and
that's why it's been conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The positive impact of psychedelics in
terms of substance abuse and depression is
[SPEAKER_00]: contingent on psychedelic induced
neurogenesis and neuroplasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out there's several species
of non-psychedelic mushrooms that also
[SPEAKER_00]: promote enhanced neurogenesis and
neuroplasticity like turkey's tail,
[SPEAKER_00]: lion's mane, cordyceps, things that we
were learning about through Paul Stamets
[SPEAKER_00]: and others and that we can access legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to focus for a moment now on the
5H2A.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the serotonin 2A receptor because
that's the receptor that in 1998 France,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Swiss scientist, he showed that LSD and
psilocybin, they exert their potent
[SPEAKER_00]: hallucinogenic effects through this
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the serotonin 2A is the psychedelic
receptor and it is responsible when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: activated for many of the signature
effects we associated with psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are these signature effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, vivid kaleidoscopic visions for
starters, but that's only the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, radically altered sense of time
experience, experiential density,
[SPEAKER_00]: dazzling immediacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we associated with the
psychedelic experience and this is all
[SPEAKER_00]: being mediated by the 5H2A receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's responsible for these effects and
it's also responsible, interestingly,
[SPEAKER_00]: for changes in gene expression in the
cerebral cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And changes in synaptic plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This receptor mediates it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher 5H2A binding affinity,
like LSD has a very strong binding
[SPEAKER_00]: affinity, that predicts a more potent
neurogenic and neuroplastic effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: the greater the binding affinity for the
ligand.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 5H2A receptor antagonists block the
ability of psychedelics to promote
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and synaptic
plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, again, a confirmation this is the
pathway that the psychedelics are
[SPEAKER_00]: conferring this effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aberrant serotonin 2A signaling is linked
to headaches, mood disorders,
[SPEAKER_00]: hallucinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These receptors are dysregulated in the
prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, CBD also binds directly to
this receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LSD and CBD bind directly to this
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is considered more active than the
5HT1A receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically what we've been hearing
about at this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a receptor that mediates the
anti-anxiety effects of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the anti-depressant effects,
I'm not so sure, but it's one of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor partners for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD does not bind well with the
cannabinoid receptors, but it binds very
[SPEAKER_00]: powerfully with the serotonin 1A,
less so with 2A, but it does bind to it
[SPEAKER_00]: directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that serotonin 2A
receptor is more prevalent in the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: and body than 1A.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressed in nearly every cell type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its highest density is in the neocortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD, it exhibits enough affinity at
this receptor to talk about it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: context of this is a meaningful pathway
for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not something that's generally
discussed much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The focus usually is in terms of 1A.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, how is it possible
that you have LSD, which is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic drug you can imagine,
and CBD is about the most unpsychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: drug you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it that they're both binding to the
same receptor and having such different
[SPEAKER_00]: effects in that obviously CBD isn't making
a person trip out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is through something called
functional selectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see, I wish I had the image
up on the screen, but if you have sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a highway, and you're hitting this
receptor, and then with LSD and CBD on
[SPEAKER_00]: either lane, and then it separates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it connects later downstream,
because both of them are promoting
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis and neuroplasticity,
but one is intensely psychedelic and one
[SPEAKER_00]: is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So functional selectivity, what does that
mean that different ligands, ligands are
[SPEAKER_00]: the key that's fitting into the lox.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the different ligands.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and LSD signaling through the same
receptor, in this case 5HT2A, can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct physiological responses that
culminate in similar downstream effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the downstream effects,
again, neurogenesis and neuroplasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now THC does not bind directly to any
of the serotonin receptors, unlike CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But THC does engage in what scientists
refer to as crosstalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between the endocannabinoid system and the
serotonin system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does this through something called
receptor dimerization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means when two different
receptors, they kind of get entangled and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can join.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's increasingly understood that this
happens a lot, but it's not clear why it
[SPEAKER_00]: happens or exactly what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the preclinical research,
interestingly, shows that the CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid receptor and the 5H2A
serotonin receptor, when they form what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called a heterodimer, that this is
responsible for mediating both THC's pain
[SPEAKER_00]: killing effects as well as its memory
impairment effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the CB1 5H2A receptor
heterodimers are expressed and
[SPEAKER_00]: functionally active in specific brain
areas involved in memory impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, there's another
heterodimer between CB1 and adenosine,
[SPEAKER_00]: A2A.
[SPEAKER_00]: That when CBD activates that complex,
it restores memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of acts THC's memory impairment
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about cannabis now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you consider cannabis to be
psychedelic?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really a matter of dose
because small doses, moderate doses are
[SPEAKER_00]: relaxing for most people, fun,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But high doses can be psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I wonder is, is this heterodimer
between the CB1 receptor, which THC will
[SPEAKER_00]: activate, because it's linked now to 5H2A,
is that responsible for the hallucinogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of very high doses of THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some interesting research of
all places from the University of Kansas
[SPEAKER_00]: that did a series of studies where they
showed that cannabinoid receptor agonists
[SPEAKER_00]: upregulate and enhance 5H2A.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5H2A receptor activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they weren't working with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were working with synthetic agonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the implication is possibly that
cannabis will actually upregulate,
[SPEAKER_00]: a high dose will upregulate the serotonin
2A receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have another connection there
between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fitzhugh Ludlow was the first American
writer to write about hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from before the Civil War.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has this wonderful phrase about how
hashish loosens the girders of the soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's maybe like the default mode network
being suppressed or suspended.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this kind of experience of a high dose
of cannabis or cannabinoids being
[SPEAKER_00]: hallucinogenic, like mushrooms,
well, there was actually a study done in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1969 by Dr. Harris Isbell, who happened to
be a key player in the CIA's work with
[SPEAKER_00]: LSD, comparing high doses of pure THC to
LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he concluded that high doses of THC
are hallucinogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that there's been any
other formal study other than this one
[SPEAKER_00]: going in 1969.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's my speculation that this conjugate
between the cannabinoid receptor and the
[SPEAKER_00]: serotonin receptor, this may be implicated
in the neurobiological underpinnings of
[SPEAKER_00]: hallucinations caused by high dose THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teasing this out a little bit further,
this is a really fascinating study by Dave
[SPEAKER_00]: Nichols and his group at Purdue from 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you read the title of the abstract.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it's saying is that when you activate
the serotonin 2A receptor, it results in
[SPEAKER_00]: the formation and release of
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you have this connection between
the serotonin system and the endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD, LSD, psilocybin, activating 5H2A.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will induce the creation, the
formation, the release of endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, and particularly 2AG is the
cannabinoid that's released.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a follow-up study three years
later basically affirming the same thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the serotonin invokes endocannabinoid
release that results in activating the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid receptors that function in a
way to sort of turn down a
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotransmission or like a dimmer switch
almost of other neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I found striking in this study,
it stated that based on the extensive
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of 5H2 receptors and CB1
receptors, it seems likely that this
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism could mediate many of the
actions of 5H2 receptors throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be a possible answer to the
puzzling phenomena of how CBD seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to exert effects that are very
similar to the effects of the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors being activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not understood how that works because
CBD doesn't really directly activate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be through this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see really going on here,
okay, we have an agonist like LSD or CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: binding the serotonin 2A receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This releases endocannabinoids,
2AG, which then bind to cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors, CB1 receptor, which promote
neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be the four-step pathway
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is then the last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interaction between 5H2A receptors and
endocannabinoid system is fundamental to
[SPEAKER_00]: the neurogenic and antidepressant effects
of classical psychedelic drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5HT2A induced 2AG release promotes
neurogenesis, neuroplasticity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and new neuroconnections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to lead people to new
perspectives on life somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phrase in neuroscience,
neurons that fire together wire together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brain kind of gets stuck in certain
habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems that these psychedelic drugs
can sort of catapult people out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ruts, the brain ruts that they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with a very long-lasting effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's so puzzling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do these things have such a
long-lasting effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think science really has an
answer to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you probably want to look at
many different fields to perhaps get an
[SPEAKER_00]: answer, because this is an existential
thing we're talking about, a major life
[SPEAKER_00]: change that results from these experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would look at certain philosophers
like the phenomenologists like
[SPEAKER_00]: Merleau-Ponty, who the Phenomenology of
Perception published in 1945, actually
[SPEAKER_00]: talks about mescaline very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he says, interestingly,
is that one of the key features of
[SPEAKER_00]: mescaline is synesthesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing sounds, hearing colors,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another signature effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he concludes in this massive
philosophical tome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, by the way, was the chair of the
Sorbonne philosophy department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a leading philosopher in
France.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that basically synesthesia,
when you really analyze it, is the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: way of perceiving that gets sort of
overlaid by conditioning as we go through
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that psychedelics sort of remind us of
this experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some questions if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
