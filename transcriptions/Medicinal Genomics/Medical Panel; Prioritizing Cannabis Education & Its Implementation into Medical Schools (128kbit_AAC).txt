[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for coming to CanMed
2019 and spending your day here with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for, I mean, even just showing
up to this panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not easy to show up anywhere at 2 p
.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: on a Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually, you know, you've got work,
driving your kids around to soccer
[SPEAKER_03]: practice, picking them up from school,
or, you know, maybe you have to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: school and you're here instead,
which is actually a very, very special
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that you are deciding to educate
yourself about the power of the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is pretty phenomenal, if,
I mean, if these people definitely are
[SPEAKER_03]: proof of that, you know, educating,
educating about the plant is the only way
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to tackle this industry,
tackle this space, and do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education is the only way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we go any further, I'm going to
introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Mary Carrion, and I am a
journalist, and I've been covering the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis beat for about five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm currently the editor at Mary Jane,
where we cover everything from culture and
[SPEAKER_03]: science, news, everything in the cannabis
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know us, you should look us
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find us at MaryJane.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I was saying, education is the
reason why we're here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are at a pivotal moment in history
where education is going to change
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I said, you guys are here today to
become educated, and we are here to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about how cannabis is going to be
incorporated into the education system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is historic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are, everyone who is here today is also
making history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the fact that we're able to
sit here in this kind of ballroom
[SPEAKER_03]: experience is a very unique thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wouldn't be able to do this 20 years
ago, or even less than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too long ago, we were not able to do
this, so this is a very, very big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being here today is proof of how powerful
lifting the chains of prohibition is,
[SPEAKER_03]: even if it's only a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look how much we're able to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look how much we're able to do with just a
little bit of leeway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And imagine how that's going to be in 10,
15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a great thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing, us being here today,
is proof that the government isn't always
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact, not that we need any more
examples of how the government isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: right, but, you know, it's proof that
there's a need for, it's a proof that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a need for education.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a proof that there's a need to know
about the plant and move forward to
[SPEAKER_03]: progress into what this whole industry is
going to become.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel lucky to bring this kind of
education through.
[SPEAKER_03]: A stacked group of Rockstar panelists,
and I would like to give them a round of
[SPEAKER_03]: applause.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, they could be doing anything
today, and they're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're here with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a really great thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you all for showing up today.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a really great experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are just as much of Rockstars for
showing up and showing your love for the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before we get into our discussion,
I'm going to briefly go over a PowerPoint,
[SPEAKER_03]: just so everybody is on the same page and
we know what we're discussing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who is on this panel?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, well, we originally had some
people on this panel, but we have new
[SPEAKER_03]: people on the panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Caroline McCallum, who is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a little bit about yourself,
Caroline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this on?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring it a bit closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Caroline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done my specialty training in
internal medicine, and I focus on complex
[SPEAKER_00]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do addiction and complex disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I formally, in my training, worked as a
pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I bring a combination of skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm working out of Vancouver,
BC in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, we've got some things that
are a little bit different up there in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping today I'll be able to draw
on a lot of those experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps we can have a discussion about
what opportunities may be possible in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having Caroline on our panel with us is
a phenomenal thing, because she's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to provide some differences in
terms of where the United States is
[SPEAKER_03]: currently and where the United States can
be later using Canada as a mirror in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of education and the freedom that they
have up there in terms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have Dr. David Behrman in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I didn't get anybody with that bomb
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a little bit about yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that inauspicious beginning,
I'm a physician.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been practicing medicine for over 50
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of that has been doing addiction
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing cannabis medicine for 20
years, as well as pain management.
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to being a clinician,
about half my career has been as an
[SPEAKER_04]: administrator at all levels of government.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am an author.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pushing my new book, Cannabis
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be a great textbook.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was written in combination with The
Nurse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically with the idea of it being a
textbook.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have other books on the history of
drug laws and the way drugs have been used
[SPEAKER_04]: in society.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that's disturbing to
me is how little physicians know about the
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's arguably the largest neurotransmitter
system in the human brain, central to
[SPEAKER_04]: homeostasis, modulates the speed of
neurotransmission.
[SPEAKER_04]: Important in the function of the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it touches on an enormous spectrum of
illnesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is frankly criminal that so few
medical schools actually discuss the
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system, let alone talk
about the medical utility of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's very, very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we also have Dr. Tom Follin,
who is joining us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're really grateful he's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Mary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my first year presenting on a
panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will have the opportunity to hear me
talk later about cannabis hyperemesis
[SPEAKER_01]: syndrome on the 5 o'clock panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was asked kind of last minute to
fill in for Daniel Piemelli, who couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little about myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a neuroradiologist by training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I graduated medical school in 2007.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through a personal story, one of my
siblings became quite ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: With an autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, cannabis proved
instrumental in his rehabilitation and
[SPEAKER_01]: continues to until this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: As part of my second act in medicine,
in addition to being a neuroradiologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: I maintain a clinical practice in cannabis
slash cannabinoid medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: My focus is on glioblastoma patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Given my neuroradiological training and
interest in all things neurological.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm also educating myself and taking
on clients with anything from all autism
[SPEAKER_01]: to low level anxiety to medication
reconciliation in seniors.
[SPEAKER_01]: All things cannabis and endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to echo what Dr. Berman and Dr.
McCallum were saying, it is absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: criminal that we have physicians
graduating medical schools, as I did in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2007, not learning a single thing about
one of the largest systems in our body.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that brings us pretty much to our next
point here is, you know, the fact that the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system is one of the
largest systems in our body and in our
[SPEAKER_03]: brains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that no doctors are being
taught about this, I mean, that needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: change given how many people are using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some startling statistics are the fact
that only 13% of medical schools even
[SPEAKER_03]: mention the endocannabinoid system
according to a survey by Dr. David Allen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And only 9% report teaching, only 9% of
universities report teaching about medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana according to Washington
University School of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately only out of 172 medical
schools in North America, of which 101
[SPEAKER_03]: replied to a specific survey, 66% reported
that they were not equipped to prescribe
[SPEAKER_03]: or even answer questions about medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 90% of doctors aren't learning anything
about medical marijuana in school.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's very alarming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to get fixed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we're here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we'll go through this very quickly,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what is the endocannabinoid system,
just to get everybody up to speed,
[SPEAKER_03]: is basically a biological system composed
of endocannabinoids in the body,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are neurotransmitters that bind to
cannabinoid receptors through our
[SPEAKER_03]: vertebrae, yeah, through our vertebrae and
through the nervous system.
[SPEAKER_03]: They bind to CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, again, it controls homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It impacts a healthy operating immune
system and impacts our sleep health.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really impacts a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'll just leave this on the board
for you guys for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are the schools that are
currently offering courses on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are not all of them,
but these are some of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are pretty major universities.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still not enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're going to get into some of
these questions that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the first question I will ask is,
for our wonderful panelists, how does the
[SPEAKER_03]: current federal status of cannabis impact
the various forms of education that you
[SPEAKER_03]: are allowed to pursue?
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, Caroline.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming from the Canadian experience,
and from this angle, I was joking to Mary
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were just chatting earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how does this impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it hasn't affected my practice
of cannabis over the past five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've recognized at a federal
level, a medical cannabis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has gone through multiple changes over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's a lot easier for patients to
get medical cannabis than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The access has evolved dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have over 170 companies growing
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, they've been licensed but in
various stages of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, it's been really easy,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with legalization for
recreational purposes at a federal level,
[SPEAKER_00]: which occurred last fall in 2018,
now we're seeing even greater need for
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really feel like I've had red
tape in terms of my ability to educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just the need is just so much greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the big issues that I'm
facing, or just the difficulties I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: having, is with redundancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, we're not speaking to
one another at the various levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are federal groups, sorry,
like federal programs, different
[SPEAKER_00]: provincial or state programs, different
associations and stakeholders and
[SPEAKER_00]: universities all creating very similar
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really unfortunate because I just
think we could combine and be stronger and
[SPEAKER_00]: get more and more experts involved instead
of trying to do our own version kind of on
[SPEAKER_00]: our own instead of in a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't really say there's any
barriers to creating educational
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities in Canada, but it's just
been that we're not really working
[SPEAKER_00]: together as well as we could.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys have definitely a level of
freedom that we don't have here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that freedom, I mean, I'm sure that's
extremely overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more than the federal government.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the 70 year history of stigma that's
been attached to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people are unaware that in 1937,
the AMA testified vigorously against the
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that testimony said the AMA knows
of no dangers from the medical use of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of medical schools, most of them
won't touch talking about cannabis with a
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 foot pole because many of them are
reliant on federal funding and they have
[SPEAKER_04]: no idea what the federal government will
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as the recent hubbub over whatever it
was that Trump did do or didn't do,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can see that there's a lot of subtlety
in terms of encouraging or discouraging
[SPEAKER_04]: people to do certain things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And medical schools are discouraged from
even doing research about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Donnelly Abrams, who is an oncologist
at UC San Francisco, for about eight or
[SPEAKER_04]: nine years submitted a proposal to NIDA to
demonstrate whether or not cannabis was
[SPEAKER_04]: beneficial in treating the neuropathic
pain from AIDS.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, the director of NIDA said,
Don, you have to submit a proposal showing
[SPEAKER_04]: the dangers of cannabis, not the benefits,
because we're the National Institute of
[SPEAKER_04]: Drug Abuse, not the National Institute of
Drug Use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in listening to researchers talk about
the difficulties that they've had,
[SPEAKER_04]: they've been enormous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very difficult to even do
research with whole cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much of the research that's been done is
with isolates or with Marinol or with CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as the folks in Nimbin, which has the
longest drug war protest of all,
[SPEAKER_04]: second longest after Seattle, they had a
sign there saying, the plant, the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, and nothing but the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that there's a great problem
in the medical schools utilizing the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, the whole plant, and nothing but
the plant, and talking about the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're much more likely to talk about the
pharmaceuticalization of this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that also represents a barrier
in addition to the stigma and the money
[SPEAKER_04]: that the federal government wields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on that note, what is happening right
now currently in terms of medical
[SPEAKER_03]: education?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Follin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll take this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Mary pointed out earlier,
a 2017 study out of St. Louis University
[SPEAKER_01]: in Washington found that 9% of US medical
schools out of the 101 that responded were
[SPEAKER_01]: actually teaching anything about the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe another statistic there was
85% of students didn't feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: discussing cannabis with their patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this really weird situation
where we have 33 states which have
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized in the District of Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in many cases, I would say most
everyone in this room knows more about
[SPEAKER_01]: their local doctor does about cannabis,
which is just an unacceptable and an
[SPEAKER_01]: untenable situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Dr. Beerman points out,
a large part of this has nothing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with the fact that there's nothing to
teach about cannabis or that the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system is not implicated
in autism, in fibromyalgia, in migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with the stigma that cannabis
is a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like how we all are aware that
NIDA will not commission a study or
[SPEAKER_01]: approve it unless it is focused on the
harms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all heard from Dr. Sulak earlier
today talking about a crutch versus a
[SPEAKER_01]: tonic and these really important key
concepts for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just becomes increasingly obvious
every year that the status quo is
[SPEAKER_01]: unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what does portend hope and give us
room for hope is as we see on the screen
[SPEAKER_01]: here, all of these colleges that 10 years
ago would not have been teaching about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or taking it seriously,
the writing is on the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I certainly think that 9% number is
going to continue to increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the issues that is talked about
with incorporating this into the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: school curriculum is, well, they say,
well, where are we gonna find the 10 to 20
[SPEAKER_01]: hours of coursework?
[SPEAKER_01]: And no joke, this is an actual thing
that's being discussed even with pharmacy
[SPEAKER_01]: schools who are also looking to
incorporate cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they going to give up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's just where the
conversation is at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly, as we said, given our
increasing recognition of the ECS,
[SPEAKER_01]: its pleotropicity, the many different
targets, CB1, CB2, GPR55, TRPV,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these receptors, again,
there's just no way we're going backwards
[SPEAKER_01]: on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So forward momentum.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Caroline, can I say one other thing,
which is that the doctors out there
[SPEAKER_04]: recognize that they don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had more than 100 doctors in southern
Santa Barbara County refer patients to me
[SPEAKER_04]: because they feel uncomfortable,
not just because of their lack of
[SPEAKER_04]: knowledge, but because of the stigma
that's associated with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've tried to do CME and we have done
CME.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got an organization called the
American Academy of Cannabinoid Medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody wants to collaborate with us or
collaborate with the people from Canada,
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to have more of these kinds of
conferences and we need to integrate this
[SPEAKER_04]: into pain management conferences.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have seen some gradual improvement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that we are making progress,
but I'd like to see it be a lot more rapid
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's no excuse for the status
quo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Caroline, what is your involvement in
the education system, in the university
[SPEAKER_03]: system in Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how is it there?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it differ from what we're doing
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I do educate on a number of
different levels and with different groups
[SPEAKER_00]: of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the university currently,
I teach a couple of lectures for the
[SPEAKER_00]: School of Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly, I'm working with the,
they've got a painting curriculum,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I do a lecture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also lecture in there with some
fibromyalgia and other complex diseases in
[SPEAKER_00]: their curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the medical school, actually not at
the undergraduate level, but at the
[SPEAKER_00]: post-graduate level, I actually take the
fellows in my clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I frequently get geriatric fellows,
pain medicine fellows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had an orthopedic fellow,
also palliative care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these areas are obviously areas where
we use quite a bit of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm actually getting interest from
pediatric fellows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are residents in their final
years of training, which is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they come to the clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they'll spend a few days,
maybe up to a month with us, and really
[SPEAKER_00]: learning a lot about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that that's been a really
big win for us, that the clinic where I
[SPEAKER_00]: work is actually considered a clinical
teaching site by the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised that it didn't take quite
as much work as I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pretty open to it, because
especially in Vancouver, where I am,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just so much cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what we focus on,
is that your patients are doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to equip the physicians with
the right information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say those are largely the two
areas I'm educating, but we really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it into the formal curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be the undergraduate
program, like Dr. Follin has already
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am teaching some academic half days
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a three-hour lecture block that
I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those specialties that I've mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly, we are seeing some changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been, I think, really
beneficial to show that we're certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing greater need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the fellows are going to
their program and demanding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's how it's got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just tell them what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, having the students recognize it as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things, we're talking about
professional training here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's no reason why this shouldn't
be taught in high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in junior colleges.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should we wait until people get to
medical school or nursing school?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're talking about a very amazing
substance that has this incredible broad
[SPEAKER_04]: array of applications as evidenced by your
talking about the different specialties
[SPEAKER_04]: that come and see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people, doctors are hungry for this
kind of information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had three physicians from Ohio that
spent several days with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a doctor from London that spent some
time with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to set up more fellowships and
more opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only for students to learn by the
lecture method, but by working with the
[SPEAKER_04]: doctors that are in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that I might mention is
years ago, I started a speaker's bureau on
[SPEAKER_04]: sex education at the University of
Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the faculty, OBGYN faculty and
psychiatry faculty said, look,
[SPEAKER_04]: the medical students are meeting once a
month for three hours to talk about human
[SPEAKER_04]: sexuality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think we can have a few more
hours in the curriculum?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that organizing the medical
students to demand this or even to
[SPEAKER_04]: self-educate themselves by inviting people
like the people on the podium here,
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Piemeli or what have you, is one way
to help move things forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: You also have to have people on the inside
like Dr. Piemeli and like Bob Solomon who
[SPEAKER_04]: can lobby for having more time in the
curriculum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as has been pointed out here,
there is a lot of competition for FaceTime
[SPEAKER_04]: with medical students.
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think we can do to get medical
schools and universities to teach about
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything that we can do either
students or as professors or doctors?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll comment on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's already occurring right here
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: UC Irvine, UCSD and UCLA have medical
student associations focused on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the cannabis initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're famously occurring at UCLA with
Ziva Cooper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is generating excitement and
also by virtue of CanMed occurring every
[SPEAKER_01]: year and all of these cannabis
conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are actually approaching us now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get many emails and phone calls,
texts, like Dr. Fulton.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think what you're doing is very
exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently working at the State
University of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in discussions with them about
potentially talking to their medical
[SPEAKER_01]: students about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really just by virtue of being an
advocate for the status quo, for the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that patients are using this substance
anyway, and really kind of just shaming
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical establishment into
understanding that, look, there's two ways
[SPEAKER_01]: about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your patients are either going to use
cannabis and you're going to know nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, or your patients are going to
use cannabis and you're going to know
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that tact, we actually are achieving
progress where all around the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe just recently this month in
South Florida, one of the osteopathic
[SPEAKER_01]: schools there just incorporated the
teaching of medical cannabis for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time into their curriculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Miami Dade Community College just
started incorporating some classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the change is occurring, but it's
incumbent upon all of us to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing for this change, to continue
talking about, as again, Dr. Sulak
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned today, how cannabis,
it changed my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of times we hear this from
patients is just overwhelming,
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact, and you almost believe like it's
a canned report.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned patients, and I think that
that's an important focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in California, we're the Wild
West, and a lot of physicians that are
[SPEAKER_04]: making recommendations for cannabis aren't
really practicing medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just minting money.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're spending 10 minutes or 15 minutes
with the patient, and fairly often some of
[SPEAKER_04]: these patients come and see me and spend
another hour with me because they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: understand how it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patients want to know how cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to know why it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to know what it treats.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to know what dose they should
take.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to know what to do if they get
high.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all things that people like
those of us up here that have worked with
[SPEAKER_04]: patients over time have come to learn and
come to understand through hard work,
[SPEAKER_04]: through listening to the patients,
and there should be a more solid
[SPEAKER_04]: foundation for us to do this rather than
having to spend years of experience or
[SPEAKER_04]: digging into dusty books to find the
answers that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really need to directly assault the
stigma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that the Marijuana Tax Act was
passed for economic reasons because DuPont
[SPEAKER_04]: and the petrochemical industry was
concerned about competition from hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had nothing to do with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd be remiss not to mention law
schools as well, and so we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start to see even pharmacy schools and
nursing schools and so forth and
[SPEAKER_00]: psychology and the works, but just to
mention, we were both recently talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about medical legal cases and certainly
the need for physicians who are
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable in cannabis for medical
legal purposes, so certainly testifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost get a request every week for
something of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a huge amount of work to do
especially because you really do have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to go through all the evidence and
to be able to support the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also been asked to speak for a lot
of law societies just as an evening event,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think we're going to start to see
that in their curriculum as well for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: How important do you think it is then that
medical schools and law schools and the
[SPEAKER_03]: various forms of schools, how important it
is for them to work together?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I suppose that the law schools,
they already are trained in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: dealing with substance issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a standard textbook that was
written by the former dean of the law
[SPEAKER_04]: school up at Santa Clara, General Ullman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like Dr. McCallum said, I have spoken
to legal groups, usually groups of defense
[SPEAKER_04]: attorneys, and the interesting thing in
regards to the cases that I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: involved in, there's a couple of
interesting things.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is that you get exposed to things that
you wouldn't get exposed to in the
[SPEAKER_04]: clinical practice of medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get asked sort of unusual questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other thing is how often the
defendant is obviously not guilty of the
[SPEAKER_04]: offense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've written my reports in the hope of
educating the district attorney to get
[SPEAKER_04]: them to either have a more reasonable plea
deal or to drop the charges.
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally speaking, I haven't been that
effective at educating the district
[SPEAKER_04]: attorneys through my reports, but I think
it's critical for particularly prosecutors
[SPEAKER_04]: and law enforcement personnel to be
familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the other problem is that we are
stuck in medicine with a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_04]: hold themselves out to be experts and are
not, and I know the California Highway
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrol had such an expert.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't mention the man's name,
but he created his own research,
[SPEAKER_04]: which wasn't very well done, and that was
then integrated into standard police
[SPEAKER_04]: policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the guy who said, if you smoke
marijuana, you get a green tongue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I have a show of hands of how many
people have seen green tongue?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just add one more point on to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think we could go all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just prompted me on a couple of other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what's really important when
you ask the medical schools and the law
[SPEAKER_00]: schools and how that could happen is that
what I noticed, especially doing the three
[SPEAKER_00]: cases, I did one on impairment,
one on anxiety, and one on pain
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, was that I really couldn't
give them an answer until I explained the
[SPEAKER_00]: science of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want a one pager, and it doesn't
work that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in actual fact, I was really a glutton
for punishment because the first case I
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote 60 pages, and I included a
dictionary of terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the 10 clinical pearls that you need
to understand to understand what I'm even
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, and then all three cases I
was actually doing a rebuttal of other
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians' opinions, which were
completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were psychiatrists, and so therefore
the person had anxiety, so cannabis must
[SPEAKER_00]: be inducing the anxiety, not that she's
using cannabis to treat the anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really for law, for them to be able to,
we each have to help each other because
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't even know the science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes back to also what you were saying
about there is no communication happening
[SPEAKER_03]: between the various groups of people who
are either governing cannabis or teaching
[SPEAKER_03]: about cannabis, and there's redundancy as
a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to piggy-tail one point on
that, which is that there's a lot of work
[SPEAKER_01]: going on right now with this toxicologist
called Ryan Marino, where every day on
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitter he debunks these news stories
where police went to a site and he picked
[SPEAKER_01]: up some fentanyl and he passed out and he
overdosed, and we're even seeing these
[SPEAKER_01]: stories coming out about fentanyl-laced
cannabis, believe it or not, where it was
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about, and so it is incumbent and
especially important for those of us
[SPEAKER_01]: within the medical community with
knowledge of cannabis to be active on
[SPEAKER_01]: these forums and talking about the
ridiculousness and non-possibility of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things, and also just to add on as
well, in the current state, I practice in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York currently, and in New York,
if you recommend medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's four hours of required CME,
so in addition to the medical schools and
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching there, we also want to be
teaching at the state levels, but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a state cannabis program,
how are those physicians getting educated
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in California, there's no such
requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Canada, there's no requirements at
all either to authorize cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very different when you look at
programs like suboxone programs or
[SPEAKER_00]: methadone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must have 10 hours or whatever number,
and so really, this issue of competencies
[SPEAKER_00]: and having standardized programs that
actually meet the needs for the
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribers I think are very important,
so yeah, Tom, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: To Caroline's point, in the U.S.,
we can't call ourselves prescribers
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's federally illegal to
prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are merely the recommenders that
cannabis may be beneficial for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, the reason that we can recommend
is that fortunately, the Constitution does
[SPEAKER_04]: not say when you get your MD degree,
you lose your First Amendment right to
[SPEAKER_04]: free speech, so if somebody asks you,
what do you think about cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine, you can say, I think it's great,
I think it's awful, I have no idea,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the government cannot put a gag over
your mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot what the heck I was gonna say.
[SPEAKER_04]: What part were you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about prescribing,
and actually in Canada, it's called
[SPEAKER_00]: authorizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I slipped there, and I wasn't sure how you
guys word it, but basically because
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis doesn't have a DIN number,
so a drug identification number,
[SPEAKER_00]: which prescriptions do, you can't
prescribe it, so it's not a typical
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription pad you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called an authorization, and so
again, speaking to Dr. Sulak this morning
[SPEAKER_00]: that these single molecules, this is what
a DIN and pharma is really going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're trying to do is make a single
chemical entity designed to work in a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain way on a certain receptor,
which does obviously work for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, but for a number of the
conditions we're seeing, you do need a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a shotgun approach, and we don't fully
understand how the plant works,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's okay, because my patients have
10 to 20 symptoms I'm managing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and using 10 to 20 medications just
doesn't make sense, and they've already
[SPEAKER_00]: tried them, and they're not working,
so this idea of a drug and prescribing,
[SPEAKER_00]: even this kind of nomenclature we're
speaking, cannabis is just in such a
[SPEAKER_00]: different category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to relate to it as how
we've been doing with other prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of- I want to pick up on
that, because we have marginalized all
[SPEAKER_04]: plant-based medicine, and I call that the
cult of modernism, which came about in the
[SPEAKER_04]: 1920s as we began to marginalize
plant-based medicine and rely more on
[SPEAKER_04]: single entities.
[SPEAKER_04]: One other historical note is cannabis was
in the United States Pharmacopeia from
[SPEAKER_04]: 1854 until 1942, and it was available in
every drug store in the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matter of fact, at the turn of the 19th to
20th century, cannabis was the third most
[SPEAKER_04]: common ingredient in patent medicines and
prescriptions after opium and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we, and in the 1920s, American doctors
wrote two to three million prescriptions a
[SPEAKER_04]: year that contained cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, my father was a pharmacist,
and he was at the University of Minnesota
[SPEAKER_04]: School of Pharmacy in 1928, and one of
their assignments was to make tincture
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, and he said, and we had to be
very careful because the alcohol was
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of education that happens
between doctors and their patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys mind going into that a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I think is really important
is this idea of knowledge translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can speak about the evidence here
and about studies and high-level
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions, but patients don't
necessarily understand that language,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it's how do we move this
information from that area into the
[SPEAKER_00]: general public?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think something that I'm becoming a
bit better versed in is opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: editorials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been fortunate enough in Canada to
get a couple published, and so really
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to tackle an area of controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done one on psychosis in cannabis
as well as pediatrics in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really going for the big areas of
concern and saying, you know, I recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's issues, but hang on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's actually talk about this in a
logical fashion, and bringing some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence into play that I can make it such
that they understand and not focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: all the nitty gritties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that patients when they hear it
from that kind of lens that it lands a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better, but certainly in our clinic we
spend 45 minutes with patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our counselors spend an incredible amount
of time, and it's really challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, clinics you've just
mentioned, a lot of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: may do it in a different way than we do
it, and patients suffer when they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get adequate information, and then they
actually end up coming to us because
[SPEAKER_00]: they've taken too much cannabis because
they weren't taught how to use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so then they're gut reaction is I'm
never going to do that again, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really unfortunate because with some
education they could have a very different
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the patient education is just so key,
and this even brings into play what Dustin
[SPEAKER_00]: was speaking about earlier, lower dosing
and, you know, you don't need to be high,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all those kind of controversy,
well not really controversy, but patients'
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns, they're the first thing they say
when they come in our clinic, and we
[SPEAKER_00]: really can't address them adequately with
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll just, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, we're learning,
you know, this is a CanMed conference,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just even to look at psilocybin and
what we're learning there, equally
[SPEAKER_01]: important as the use of psilocybin and
something Dustin, again, pointed out
[SPEAKER_01]: today, set and setting, and, you know,
the other key concept in cannabis low and
[SPEAKER_01]: slow, all these things where famously we
remember Maureen Dowd going to Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: back in whenever she went and consuming
100 milligrams of THC and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling like she was dying, and we don't
recommend that, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're much on the order of one milligram,
two milligrams, if you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: starting with an edible, and then waiting
an hour, and as Caroline pointed out,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we do our initial intake with
patients at SolisMD, which is my cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: company, we spend an hour just giving them
the lay of the land in terms of what are
[SPEAKER_01]: your receptors, what's your ECS,
explaining the concept of bespoke
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, explaining the concept that
cannabis is not one thing, it's much more
[SPEAKER_01]: than the THC and CBD you may have heard
about, and CBD that's everywhere of
[SPEAKER_01]: questionable quality, and all these other
concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, in the same way that set and
setting are essential to psilocybin and
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic use, the same is true of
cannabis and using with intent and using
[SPEAKER_01]: the smallest amount possible to achieve
your desired outcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I want to mention is
that probably the most effective thing in
[SPEAKER_04]: getting physicians to recognize the
medical value of cannabis is their
[SPEAKER_04]: patients asking them about it,
and I think that one of the things that we
[SPEAKER_04]: need to do as healthcare professionals is
to ask our professional schools why
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not teaching about the
endocannabinoid system and about the
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I remember seeing in a cover
article in High Times in 1975,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it had a list of medical conditions
that they said that cannabis was useful in
[SPEAKER_04]: treating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to tell you the truth, I thought,
well, that's interesting, that's a nice
[SPEAKER_04]: tactic in terms of legalizing the
recreational use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then shortly after that, I looked at
these things more closely, and the more I
[SPEAKER_04]: looked at it, the more I realized that,
yes, all of those conditions and more
[SPEAKER_04]: respond to the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are saddled with this stigma
because the laws have been used to
[SPEAKER_04]: marginalize discriminated against groups,
and that's not unique for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it goes back thousands of years to
trying to marginalize the pagans or trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to marginalize the midwives that were
known to the pope as witches.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, dealing with the stigma is important,
and what's really important is to do what
[SPEAKER_04]: the doctors up here have done,
and that is to stand up and speak out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to be obnoxious,
you don't have to be abrasive.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you need to do is extol the virtues
of science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are in an anti-science era where
98% of scientists say there is global
[SPEAKER_04]: warming, and yet the President of the
United States is selling plastic straws
[SPEAKER_04]: for $15 apiece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that, you know, leads me to a whole
other question and point is what
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibilities do institutions have to
help shape an equitable future in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an idealist, so I would say they have
a great responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things that's being
discussed, which of course may be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: controversial, is the whitewashing of the
cannabis industry, and the fact that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have so many predominantly people of color
and Latinos in prison for maybe selling a
[SPEAKER_01]: dime bag, and yet we have other
enterprises that are predominantly male,
[SPEAKER_01]: predominantly white, doing very well in
the nascent cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, certainly I think there's a role that
we don't whitewash or forget the history,
[SPEAKER_01]: as Dr. Bierman has talked about,
that had nothing to do with the health of
[SPEAKER_01]: people or the safety of people or the
welfare of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, again, I would encourage,
as I'm sure all of us are, to go against
[SPEAKER_01]: the grain, to continue asking the
questions, to continue spreading unpopular
[SPEAKER_01]: truths, to get involved, and yeah,
I don't give the institutions any slack.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we're learning about MIT recently that
accepted money from a known pedophile,
[SPEAKER_01]: we certainly need to be keeping an eye on
institutions and questioning where their
[SPEAKER_01]: money's coming from and questioning what
their narratives are.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me say also that one of the problems
that I think we need to fight with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis is the pharmaceuticalization of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Dr. McCallum talked about the
difficulty in treating the plant as though
[SPEAKER_04]: it were a single molecule medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've only had single molecule
medication since 1897.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people, well, we have had some
breakthroughs.
[SPEAKER_04]: These pre-1897 plant-based medicines were
effective for many things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think part of the problem,
and I hope I'm not stepping on too many
[SPEAKER_04]: toes here, is we have people who have got
their priorities reversed where they're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at making the money first and
helping the people later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And frankly, I think you can do better for
society and actually better for your
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom line if you put the patient first.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really what education of the
medical schools and nursing schools is
[SPEAKER_04]: important so that we can put the patient
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do interested professors and
institutions need to know before adding
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis as an option for degrees or
courses?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of the things that we should do
is to lobby state legislators in medical
[SPEAKER_04]: legal states for them to pay for research
about the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this will have people in the medical
school that have a horse in the race.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also, as Dr. McCallum pointed out,
should require physicians who are making
[SPEAKER_04]: more than, say, a handful of
recommendations to have eight to 12 hours
[SPEAKER_04]: of continuing medical education.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the questions that we talked
about in preparing for, oh, one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: most important things we need to do in
order to get cannabis taught in medical
[SPEAKER_04]: schools.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical schools are very concerned about
how their students do on the national
[SPEAKER_04]: boards.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to lobby the national boards to
have a couple of questions on the
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system on the national
boards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one other thing I want to say before I
forget it, because one of the questions is
[SPEAKER_04]: what can we do and what can you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems to me that one of the persons
that has been hurt by the stigmatization
[SPEAKER_04]: is Dr. Mishulam.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that what we need to do is
lobby for Dr. Mishulam to receive the
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobel Prize for Science and Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just another point kind of on this same
topic is also considering other
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at, oh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody give a round of applause to
Professor Robert Solomon, who is at the
[SPEAKER_03]: UCI Center for the Study of Cannabis,
who made it today and it's our big deal
[SPEAKER_03]: that he's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is not walking in late, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful, it is great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so now that we have a clinical
attorney present, we can open the
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion to the elements of law that
play into incorporating cannabis into the
[SPEAKER_03]: education system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I hope I heard the question right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my position, it's very different
than when we talk about education of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis at any different level because
I'm at a professional school and we care
[SPEAKER_02]: in very rough terms about how to learn to
be a lawyer, passing the bar exam,
[SPEAKER_02]: and getting a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't see cannabis law as being
any different than, say, sports law or
[SPEAKER_02]: entertainment law.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a specialized field where we have
specialized knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said to the dean a few years ago
after attending a conference, we really
[SPEAKER_02]: need a course in cannabis law because
there are jobs out there and it is a
[SPEAKER_02]: specialized field, to which the dean said,
great, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find someone to teach it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so thus I offered the first cannabis
law course in the country at a law school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why is it important?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for one thing, this is a highly
regulated field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And highly regulated fields mean,
among other things, full employment for
[SPEAKER_02]: lawyers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very hard to negotiate, not that
that's a good thing, but it is very hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to negotiate this field without a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also true that we have very
specialized tax law affecting,
[SPEAKER_02]: you still have to pay taxes if you have a
sale of illegal, federally illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's very complicated law.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, cannabis businesses paid $5.2
billion in taxes to the federal government
[SPEAKER_02]: last two years ago, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of that was guess what,
in cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine going to IRS with bags of cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have highly complicated internet
law, which applies to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all kinds of rules affecting
investors that are not in other areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have incredible problems of local
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cannabis board has held that
although localities can prevent
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution and growing, they cannot
prevent delivery of these into
[SPEAKER_02]: municipalities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 municipalities are currently in
litigation against the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So local control is a major, major issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the whole question of federal
preemption and what it means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Law students learn this right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's the problem of driving under
the influence and what we mean by that and
[SPEAKER_02]: how we will measure that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a whole list somewhere on a
slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could teach two courses on this,
frankly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But large law firms are now getting into
the cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it is similar to real estate
law, except there are particular wrinkles
[SPEAKER_02]: based on local law and local control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a complicated area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a specialty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inevitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Professor Solomon works with Dr.
Piemeli at UCI Center for the Study of
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis, which is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And together they are tackling the
cannabis space in a multidisciplinary
[SPEAKER_03]: fashion with the law school, the
neuroscience program and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's they're doing incredible work.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, their school that they're putting
together might be a model that other
[SPEAKER_03]: schools look to to figure out just how to
make it all happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's also very, very exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's happening at UC Irvine,
Irvine in Orange County.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sign of the times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just say one quick thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave a talk at the Exploratorium in San
Francisco, and as I was leaving the
[SPEAKER_02]: subway, the BART, I could smell not the
subway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am from the New York area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell I could smell cannabis in the
air and hear the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my first thought was, we're not in
Orange County anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was talking to Mr. Solomon on the
phone and started to get into some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you suggested I'm taking a risk here
because I'm going to say that I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that I agree that you felt that defending
or dealing with cannabis was similar to
[SPEAKER_04]: dealing with other drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that the attorneys do need to
understand the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_04]: need to understand that THC is fat soluble
in order to do their job well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe you have the same feeling that I
misinterpreted what you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that some special additional
education would be helpful to attorneys in
[SPEAKER_04]: defending cases involving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we don't disagree.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, in my course, Daniele Piemelli
presents two sessions on the science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our plan is next fall to really divide
the course equally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the science is critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: My point was that the skills are the same
in driving under the influence of alcohol
[SPEAKER_02]: as driving under the influence of any
chemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the police aren't particularly
concerned with what the chemical is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had several sessions with law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they are really concerned about
is the field sobriety test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the field sobriety test is,
you've all seen this on TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you walk a straight line?
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something funny that they say.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it is somewhat true, a joke I
used to tell, that I would rather have
[SPEAKER_02]: someone stop at a green light than drive
through a red light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the police said that there actually is
some truth to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the tests that they give is turn
your head back, close your eyes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and tell me when 30 seconds has elapsed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people who are under the influence of
alcohol will often go, OK, and it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: five seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people who are under the influence of
cannabis or something else suppressing
[SPEAKER_02]: their system will be back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a minute, the officer will say,
how long has it been?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go, oh, gee, only 15 seconds,
I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem, however, according to
tests, and I do want to say to credit
[SPEAKER_02]: police, to my surprise, they're very
sophisticated about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're incredibly sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really, obviously, getting good
training on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't care that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the real.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm talking to LA police.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's LA and Orange County.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to them, the difficult part is
changing lanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Changing lanes involves a lot of executive
functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're under the influence of
almost anything, that's where the problems
[SPEAKER_02]: occur.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to go next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd just like to make a comment on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I agree with the general concept
you're mentioning, under the influence,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't really matter what the
substance is.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what my concern is, is if they
start to do random checks, so somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: driving appropriately, there's known signs
of impairment, and then they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start looking for cannabis, it's like,
well, if you're going to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: then why don't you also check for morphine
and for antihistamines and anti-nauseants
[SPEAKER_00]: and other medications that we absolutely
could cause impairment theoretically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have to understand that a
medical patient who uses that medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: every day has a very different situation
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gets us into tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets us into what's actually crossing
the blood-brain barrier and how their
[SPEAKER_00]: executive function is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really need to be pulling over the
right people and not just, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to check everybody for
cannabis because it's Thanksgiving weekend
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to take issue now regarding the
training of the Los Angeles Sheriff's
[SPEAKER_04]: Department.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is an expert witness named Nick
Murrow, who is a retired LA County
[SPEAKER_04]: Narcotics Officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he helped put together the drug
recognition exam and said that it has no
[SPEAKER_04]: scientific basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a lot of criticism of the
field sobriety test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there is a new test coming out that
seems to have some merit, and it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: nickname, Druid, D-R-U-T.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing about the police out there
is they have a very low bar to go over.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same as being in court.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what the chief of police of
Ojai said at a panel that I was at.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to prove that the person was
driving any influence beyond a reasonable
[SPEAKER_04]: doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need to have a suspicion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how strong the suspicion is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a very low bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you start looking at the police
report at the driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: In some instances, there is no description
of the person's driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have is that the person failed the
field sobriety test, or in the case I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: working on now, they actually passed the
field sobriety test.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they take a toxicology screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the DA didn't go to medical
school.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't know how to interpret the
toxicology screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: He probably doesn't know that there are
toxicology screens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he probably doesn't know that the
carvinoids are fat soluble.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you end up with a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is not a problem just with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to a hammer, everything is a nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: To a police officer, everything is a
crime.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a stroke, if you have a
hypoglycemic episode, if you previously
[SPEAKER_04]: had a traumatic brain injury and now the
police officer stops you, they are likely
[SPEAKER_04]: to think that you're under the influence
of a drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're a regular user of cannabis,
which you might well be, they're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: draw your blood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think one of the best defenses is
to ask for serial draws of your blood so
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can see that the THC is coming
from the adipose tissue and not from the
[SPEAKER_04]: result of having recently smoked a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to mention the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like being fatigued, there's rules for how
long you can't drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can only drive for so many
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are medical conditions that can
cause impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, my pain patients say that
they are better drivers when they use some
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying use cannabis and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you need to look at the full
picture and really understand what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on and not have people in court acting as
scientists and doing all this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can really make misleading cause and
effect and association and draw these
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions that may not be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to wrap up here very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one issue that I have to ask in terms
of education, education across law,
[SPEAKER_03]: education across medical, and in the
United States and in Canada, how do you go
[SPEAKER_03]: about educating about pesticides and
pesticides in products and pesticide use
[SPEAKER_03]: among growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And also because patients consume them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think until the US has
federal legalization, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get anywhere with these issues
that are very much all across the board
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to all states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just able to have an individual
state rules on these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need to have mandatory lab
testing, more than just pesticides now
[SPEAKER_00]: with vape, vitamin E, esters or acetates,
and all these different derivatives that
[SPEAKER_00]: can also potentially have long-term
outcomes we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So needing to get funding for levels for
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from, we have CIHR in Canada and you
don't have to study abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can study other parts of cannabis,
which is really important not to just be
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on harm, moving into looking at
CBD, looking at other things and not just
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational use, looking at medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, yeah, it's going to be
difficult unless you're united on these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues in terms of how you're going to go
about getting answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm in complete agreement with
Caroline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, if any of you who follow me
on Twitter will have noted that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: recently arguing with the Surgeon General
about this very point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where he was saying, oh, you know,
these kids are dying from vaping the
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana cigarettes and the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, well, actually,
you're just making the argument for
[SPEAKER_01]: federal descheduling for research and for
regulating these products so that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not producing 5,000 of these vape
cartridges per week as was occurring in
[SPEAKER_01]: the state of Wisconsin, which wouldn't you
know it, they don't have medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it turns out that people are resorting
to these illicit products because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have access to tested, regulated
products and it's way beyond pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have bioaccumulation potentially from
solvents, butane hash oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use a vape or whatever product with
BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time it's no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you're using that product every
day for years at a time and you have this
[SPEAKER_01]: bioaccumulation occurring?
[SPEAKER_01]: So really the way forward is descheduling
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research regulation testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you take a look at the newspaper
articles, they are there to sell
[SPEAKER_04]: newspapers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not there to educate people and
they often don't read the research.
[SPEAKER_04]: They may read the press release about the
research and there tends to be
[SPEAKER_04]: sensationalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have been vaporizing cannabis for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean they found things was used in
religious services as an incense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had the historic Bickel volcano
that's been around for 25, 30,
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That uses the whole cannabis and part of
our problem in this country is we really
[SPEAKER_04]: don't regulate industrial production of
just about anything that's dangerous as
[SPEAKER_04]: strongly as it should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean one of the things that I tell
people who are questionable about cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: is that it's too bad that we don't have
these same questions about all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: other pharmaceuticals that are on the
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see those questioned with the
same intensity that we have cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: because I would feel a lot safer as a
patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: By best estimates we grow in California
about $3 billion a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell legally about $1 billion a year in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Berkeley this weekend and talking
to someone and he was telling me about his
[SPEAKER_02]: cousin has a great business where he grows
and he delivers to someone who drives to
[SPEAKER_02]: Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said you realize that's not a legal
business and he said no I didn't realize
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he was a legal grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well you know our $2 billion is going
somewhere and to make it worse within the
[SPEAKER_02]: state we have created all kinds of
incentives to get a license to sell and
[SPEAKER_02]: all kinds of disincentives to get a
license to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there really are incentives starting
with tax where there is a reason as long
[SPEAKER_02]: as you can market your product to not
market it legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since the law requires a seat to sale
being able to track it it's only the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: sales that are being tracked that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know we are in a transitional
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are everything I've said is not not me
giving a radical opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows this is the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need to start working this out
and we're still early in transitional
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But somehow we're going to have to figure
out how to have a more equalized
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is going to be based on a having
a federal policy that in legal terms
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't entirely suck because the current
policy is totally insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes absolutely no sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based on racism.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based on trying to suppress groups of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based on putting people in jail and
it's based on the just say no policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well once you say just say no you're
saying abstinence is the only thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes about as little sense in
cannabis control as it does in birth
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I'd like to mention that
that reminded me of is the stigma extends
[SPEAKER_04]: to the highest levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may recall that former Vice President
Biden's son died of cancer and they did
[SPEAKER_04]: not use cannabis to try to treat his
cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he set up this program to take a look
at options.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I sent him a letter and said you
know you might want to take a look at
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't you know outrageous or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't even get the courtesy of a
response.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you really have to wonder here's a man
who lost his son to cancer and refuses to
[SPEAKER_04]: even respond or have a staff respond to a
suggestion that they look into something
[SPEAKER_04]: that we have known since 1974 can kill
cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Don Abrams has said there's more
than enough basic science research and
[SPEAKER_04]: anecdotal reports to justify doing double
blind studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems to me we're thinking about
talking about teaching medical students
[SPEAKER_04]: and nursing students pharmacy students
about the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the hooks to hang our hat on is the
fact that we know we can say for a fact
[SPEAKER_04]: that cannabis will cure your mouse's
cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can't say whether it will cure your
cancer as a human being because the double
[SPEAKER_04]: blind studies have not been done except
for one in England on glioblastoma which
[SPEAKER_04]: was had some optimistic findings.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about all the time we have for
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could talk about this forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for showing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
