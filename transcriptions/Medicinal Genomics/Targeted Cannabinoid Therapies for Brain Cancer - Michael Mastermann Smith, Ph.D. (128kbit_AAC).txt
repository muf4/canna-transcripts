[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys enjoy yourself here at UCLA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, go Bruins.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little backstory, and I'm going to try
to rush through some of the more laborious
[SPEAKER_00]: slides so that you guys can relax and
maybe incorporate some of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a tech here back in the late 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I studied pediatric brain tumors for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started studying these things called
cancer stem cells and brain tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a future and a purpose in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did my PhD here in molecular
and medical pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a pharmacologist and drug
developer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my post-doc in bioengineering
because developing drugs, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer drugs, are very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took some extra training in
bioengineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I lose my talk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I hitting the right button?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the malignant brain tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glioblastoma brain cancer is a largely
untreatable deadly cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Median survival ranges from 12 and a half
months, around 12 and a half months to 16
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disease is characterized by extreme
cellular molecular genetic heterogeneity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The standard treatment involves surgery,
radiation, and chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the first soft tissue cancer to be
shown to be a disease of cancer stem cell
[SPEAKER_00]: origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's really no predisposing
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cancers happen, and we just don't know
exactly who or when it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But glioblastomas have a tendency to be
related to older age.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also find glioblastomas in
pediatric populations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brief history of cancer stem cell biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is about 15 years in one slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer stem cells are essentially highly
malignant supercells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hijack natural stem cell survival and
cell proliferation processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They self-renew to replicate themselves
that's very important in stem cell
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they create the cells which
produce tumor bulk and which patients
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately succumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2003, cancer stem cells were first
isolated in vitro and expanded from
[SPEAKER_00]: pediatric brain tumors like I was
describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2013, 10 years later, which sort of
describes how long it takes once you go
[SPEAKER_00]: from a discovery to application,
in 2013, cannabinoid receptor agonists,
[SPEAKER_00]: both CB1 and CB2, were found to be
potentially effective in killing
[SPEAKER_00]: glioblastoma cancer stem cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was drug screening we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was directly on these cell
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a way for us to see,
oh, we can use these types of cell models
[SPEAKER_00]: to study drug development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also find insight into what
drug classes might potentially be used
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutically for glioblastoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last 15 years, which this point
relates to the fact that the cancer stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cells aren't just in brain tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a number of different cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same models have been used
repeatedly with regards to the culturing
[SPEAKER_00]: processes of taking these cancer cells,
putting them in a petri dish, looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: stem cells on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called the spher system,
which you can see at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are balls of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how stem cells look like in a
petri dish, except these are cancer stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the last 15 years, cancer stem cells
have been identified in a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: malignant and metastatic cancers,
breast, prostate, ovarian, colorectal,
[SPEAKER_00]: pancreatic, melanoma, and some others as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, the pretty picture of orange
and green and whatnot, that is when we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried a different way to differentiate
these cancer stem cell spheres to see
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they can turn into other cell
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the greens, the green labeling is
for a marker for neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the orange labeling was actually red,
but there's red and green, and they make
[SPEAKER_00]: orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are, the red markers were
markers for neural progenitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are some of the earliest studies
that we were doing and trying to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually had in a petri dish and study
this cancer stem cell phenomena.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science behind cannabinoid-based
cancer therapy is rooted in signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walk away from this meeting and you
wanted, somebody asked you at the dinner
[SPEAKER_00]: table, what is this deal about cannabis
potentially being used as a treatment for
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based in signaling pathways that
we've been studying for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very complicated to develop drugs
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just zero in to what we need
to be focused on in this slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that in the very middle, you're going
to see a red and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's AKT and mTOR.
[SPEAKER_00]: mTOR and AKT are considered sort of like a
therapeutic graveyard, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to develop these drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get to clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're trying to target AKT and mTOR,
very difficult drugs to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the drugs that we try to move
through the clinic don't make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fail in pre-clinical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to become very important,
because I'm going to talk about AKT and
[SPEAKER_00]: mTOR, and you're going to walk away with
AKT and mTOR like, oh my god, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things that we're going to
be using in the future to treat cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom of the slide is all the cancer
things that go on in a cell regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the right side, epithelium
mesenchymal transition called EMT
[SPEAKER_00]: transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a mechanism by which a cell could
pop off from a tumor and then go somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a mechanism of metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a stem cell process, tumor
progression in angiogenesis, cell death,
[SPEAKER_00]: autophagy, apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we're looking for when we try
to develop drugs is, can we kill the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: through apoptosis, which is cell popping
and autophagy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Autophagy is a realignment of the cell
that produced cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell proliferation, obviously very,
very important in tumor biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cell cycle, we try to block the
cell cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green arrows are activating signals,
and the orange button is an inhibitory
[SPEAKER_00]: signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of activation and
inhibition going on in a cancer cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this happens in cancer stem
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little pink thing up top is EGFR
that's going to become important to some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's epidermal growth factor receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like HER2, but a different
variant of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was very important in terms of the
data I'm about to show, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: single-cell heterogeneity analysis of
glioblastoma cancer stem cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for us to use this as a procedure
or way to identify what works,
[SPEAKER_00]: what doesn't, and develop therapies,
we had to have some decent, better tools
[SPEAKER_00]: because most of cell biology is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a lot of different cells,
and then we'll crack open like a million
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and then analyze them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And single-cell analysis basically is a
lot more high content, it's quantitative,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it allows us to label the cells,
identify signals, incorporate other
[SPEAKER_00]: signals that might be going on in parallel
or in concert with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use these microfluidic chips to
our, so on the top slide is glioblastoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take the glioblastoma, we dissociate
the cells, put them in a Petri dish,
[SPEAKER_00]: spheres form, then we break up those
spheres, and then we put them in these
[SPEAKER_00]: little microfluidic chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows us to do really
high-sensitive, low-cell number analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microfluidic chips were developed at
the California Nanosystems Institute just
[SPEAKER_00]: about a block and a half away from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at EGF.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking at the relationship
between EGFR and tumor suppressor P10,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphoAKT, and mTOR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is we overlay the cells,
it's basically quantitative immunocytic
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can quantitate the signal based on the
amount of protein that is fluorescently
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the colors represent the fluorescent
labels, and we, as I said, we looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: EGFR, P10, phosphoAKT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third thing is validation,
which is a way to quantitate and see,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, do what the signals define,
are they relevant, can we make use of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experimental data set, 15 samples,
four biomicros, thousand cells a sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60,000 data points, 15,000 cells,
all the cells I needed to do the analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm about to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: More quantitative analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Algorithms basically derive the
relationships within and between cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use self-organizing maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take molecular signatures in the
data set, the markers quantified,
[SPEAKER_00]: cell percentages are mapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what these signatures look like,
15 samples, and their molecular signatures
[SPEAKER_00]: in each little circle represents a one
unique molecular signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So brain cancer stem cells have
essentially up to 49 molecular signatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this just sort of organizes that,
and it's according to the patient sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to estimate heterogeneity.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that mapping, we do a thing called
neighborhood frequency vectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we do unsupervised clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the thing that just excited me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's excited me for years and years and
years now that we're finally getting ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to, we now have some good data set,
enough understanding of this data to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of it and publish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the left, there's unsupervised
hierarchy clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each column represents one patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each row represents one patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each column represents a unique molecular,
one of those 49 molecular phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To walk away from this, because the time
started going out, molecular signatures
[SPEAKER_00]: are defined by differences in EGFR
expression, which is in pink, and
[SPEAKER_00]: activation of AKT in red and mTOR in
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a little cheat sheet on the
lower left-hand corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying, that's the therapeutic,
you know, the places that we have very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult time developed drugs,
the little black circle, AKT and mTOR is
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the middle of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredibly important for developing
therapies for cancer and cancer stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some validation measures real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just basically grew spheres and then
counted the spheres and found out whether
[SPEAKER_00]: there was malignancy associated with the
cluster one and cluster two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cluster one had a higher malignant
signature because we needed less cells to
[SPEAKER_00]: plate to form these little spheres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cluster one, we needed more cells
to get an analysis of saying, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how do these spheres grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just, you know, lots of spheres
come from highly malignant brain cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: stem cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of spheres come from cells that
are not very malignant, and so you need
[SPEAKER_00]: more cells to put in a petri dish in order
to do your studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what that represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: AKT mTOR-activated cluster two had
significantly higher sphere formation and
[SPEAKER_00]: had higher sphere forming efficiency as an
indicator of malignancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at patient outcome because we
had the data on the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we were working in the lab,
these patients would eventually succumb to
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, so we had outcome measures of
progression and survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things act as curves,
and the curving is if the curve goes
[SPEAKER_00]: farther along the x-axis, the patient is
doing all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're surviving longer, or they're not
progressing or the MRI doesn't show a
[SPEAKER_00]: recurrence or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the x-axis is closer up to the origin,
the patient doesn't do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use these in terms of identifying
what molecular signatures or what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be looking at might be related
specifically to patient survival as an
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome measure, and it's very important
in drug development is having effective
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Targeted cannabinoid therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid receptor agonists may target
cancer stem cells by directly inhibiting
[SPEAKER_00]: PI3 kinase, AKT mTOR, TORC1, which is a
TOR complex one, and other hard-to-target
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer signaling pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into this in a lot,
but basically it goes right back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that these are very difficult
proteins to target.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are part of the cancer stem cell
machinery, and I'm going to show some
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical hope and promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I had to skip straight from basic
science writing to clinical hope and
[SPEAKER_00]: promise because this is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the thing that I was able to look
back at my data and say, oh, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: something here, that the story makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: In early 2017, GW Pharmaceuticals found
positive results in phase two proof of
[SPEAKER_00]: concept study in glioma, recurrent
glioblastoma in 21 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used a THC CBD formula in relation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a one-year survival of 83% using
the THC CBD formulation versus 53% placebo
[SPEAKER_00]: or no formulation at all, and then their
median survival is 18.3 months on the
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation versus 12.3 months placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most universes, that would be
considered blockbuster or approaching the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction of blockbuster.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really, really exciting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very good for the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very good for our understanding of
cancer biology, what we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at in terms of treating cancer,
how we diagnose things a little bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can apply the appropriate
therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a cannabinoid therapy or it's some
sort of signal transduction pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: blocker, you know, we've got to sort these
things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closer we get to the exact signaling
pathway of what a patient has,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better chance that we can do better
clinical trials and directly target the
[SPEAKER_00]: right therapy for the exact patient with
the exact sort of mutations that they
[SPEAKER_00]: might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from there, the press release from
GW Pharma, cannabinoids have been shown to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote autophagy, which is the process
of, and I always mispronounce that,
[SPEAKER_00]: the process of regulated self-degradation
by cells via several distinct mechanisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: including acting on the AKT mTOR pathway,
which is an important intracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling pathway that is overactive in
many cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically a convergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't work for GW Pharma, didn't really
know about what they were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish, but our data, it converged,
with their data, and perhaps the future
[SPEAKER_00]: might be, yes, we're now looking at cancer
stem cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are brain cancer stem cells we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the patient tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids are targeting these
specific cells, and this is a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: improved way to look at treatment,
be it as an adjunctive or as a full-on
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we now have the science there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have the potential of these
botanical drugs there, and this is all
[SPEAKER_00]: very promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when multiple groups come up with the
same solution, that's the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we need to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cures come through
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm getting choked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a long time since, I left UCLA
like five years ago, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta go do my own thing now,
and so it's great to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cancer stem cell biology crew,
Professor Harley Kornbloom really
[SPEAKER_00]: stewarded all of the brain cancer stem
cell work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a mentor of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Ed Pinozian, he's a pediatric
oncologist here down in Harbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Medio Cho was a resident in the
lab, did a lot of the basic science
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is now in the brain injury program in
the Department of Neurosurgery at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us, Copan, Tiffany, Jack,
Eric, these are my best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked very hard on very difficult
problems, and I love the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: supported the work that was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microfluidics, Professor Jing Sun is a
professor in China now.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was my postdoc when I was a grad
student.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Ken Kamei, he's now doing stem
cell work down in Japan, biotechnology and
[SPEAKER_00]: stem cells in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monori Ohase, she is going to be an MD-PhD
candidate here in the School of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Bill Wong, pathology, taught me every
single thing I knew about pathology and
[SPEAKER_00]: was just an incredible source of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: In neurosurgery, Professor Jorge Lazar,
he is a pediatric neurosurgeon that
[SPEAKER_00]: basically green-lighted all these studies
to begin with and went on to do some,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's a professor emeritus now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a close mentor to mine along with
Harley Kornbloom, and Linda Liao,
[SPEAKER_00]: the two neurosurgeons, Jorge and Linda,
had done excellent working making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that we got the samples we needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were all through extensive
collaborative efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linda is now the chair of neurosurgery
here at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in bioinformatics, we had another
great team, Tom Graber and Nicholas
[SPEAKER_00]: Graham.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really, really just came through and
we had all this random cell data and they
[SPEAKER_00]: really made good sense of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom is in CNSI and Nick Graham went on to
USC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you, CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go Bruins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got a great future with
cannabis-based medicine for going after
[SPEAKER_00]: some really, really difficult and hard to
treat diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted to make time for
questions, but I've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody has a real question,
come up to the mic real quick so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a memorandum to our lost
mavericks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senator John McCain died of a brain tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture was taken, if you can see his
left eye or right eye, left eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had just come out of surgery a few days
before this picture and he was back in
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress doing what he needed to do and he
died last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bo Biden, Vice President Biden's son,
died in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our partner on the agricultural side,
we're in the process of trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got to create this medicine from
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with agricultural partners moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh Estanko was just an agricultural
pioneer, taught me just about everything I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: About the nature of how we're going to
turn this into medicine and me coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab and then all of a sudden being
embraced by an agricultural field was
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really, really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost him to a car accident last year,
just out of nowhere, but that's just how
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In more into our lost mavericks,
we do this for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always somebody that we're going
to be helping out as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us that run into all these
catch-420s, get used to it, but you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: great work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Kristen Walshlegel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an RN or oncology nurse navigator
doing this work for about two years
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusively with cancer patients using
cannabis as well as integrated into
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a trend that I haven't heard talked
about in research recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neuroendocrine tumors seem to be very
vulnerable to some combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, whether it's neuroendocrine
tumors of pancreas, cervix, small cell
[SPEAKER_01]: lung cancer, metastatic prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to raise awareness because
it sure seems to fit in the category of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff you're interested in looking at,
neuroendocrine differentiated tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd love to talk to you and follow
up about this because these are the kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of things where we have these
conversations and then we have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through what is the real clinical process
that we would take to do a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start talking, then we might be able
to put a stitch in time with regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: these clinical trials and get these
therapies out to the fields and into the
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor's hands quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Round of applause, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Master and Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
