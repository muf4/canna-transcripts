[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the Can Med Coffee Talk
Lounge here at Can Med 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with Eni Afia, lab director of
CannaSafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief Science Officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I am sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief Science Officer, Eni Afia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for correcting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you, Eni.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be back at an in-person
event, no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you were able to make this
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now in your opinion, what's the main
value that you get out of coming to
[SPEAKER_01]: conferences like Can Med?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, the networking is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's invaluable, just the ability to
socialize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, given what's happened in the last
couple of years, just the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: socialize with folks, that's invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it's about the tidbits of new
information that I always learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the cannabis plant is so complex
that any time you get to sit with some
[SPEAKER_00]: bright minds and see what they've been
doing over the last year or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, it's been a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to really get to learn,
especially what we've just been through.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the medical practicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were sitting in on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was sitting on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, no matter how much you think
you know, even if it's a regurgitation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same information from previous years,
you always find things you've missed
[SPEAKER_00]: previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being able to see the research that's
done not only on individual cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also on whole plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're learning more and more about
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Dr. Sulak that spoke about
there are a whole new class of compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that are being found that have to do with
tryptophan or so in the cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's really interesting stuff that
you get to learn every time I come here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's interesting you say that,
too, that even if you think you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis medicine or just a cannabis
expert, there are those little tidbits
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe you didn't pick up on the last
time and that you can take away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, precisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just like a little bit of
relearning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in anything you do, you have to
practice, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you know it, just hearing it
again over and over, it starts to stick
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get to understand a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it helps us all in the industry
just grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned the practicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other presentations at CanMed that
you're really looking forward to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, apart from mine,
honestly, I see a lot of great info coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to hearing what Dr.
Mulchum has to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he will have a video presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: With what he's got coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm really looking forward to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your presentation that you mentioned
that we're all looking forward to is about
[SPEAKER_01]: preparing for DCC standardization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that one of the problems that
the DCC is looking to solve with the
[SPEAKER_01]: standardization is lab shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was hoping you could maybe explain
what the problem of lab shopping really is
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it kind of negatively affects
multiple factors of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, lab shopping is when your
clientele or certain clientele go from lab
[SPEAKER_00]: to lab, either looking for specific
results or at least going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare the results that are being given
by different labs and potentially find
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable results from a certain lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would get testing with that lab
for their compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is generally done in R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we know, California has 40
something or so labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's plenty of options to
continually travel and check labs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you find your favorable results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's one of the situations
where it's not positive for anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put it in a sense that everybody
loses in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about how, for one, a consumer
loses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, for instance, you're talking
about a potency result if somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping for certain potency results on
flour sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: A consumer ends up buying sort of a
potentially inflated result.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying more.
[SPEAKER_00]: For something that's not particularly what
you thought it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lose money right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even through a distributor to distributor
getting sold that way, if you're paying
[SPEAKER_00]: higher because of a potentially falsely
high result, they're losing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're paying more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this sort of leads to a slippery slope
where regulators lose control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about even the labs that do this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So labs start to lose in a sense that they
are producing this false results labs that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't produce this end up maybe losing
revenue, eventually closing down or laying
[SPEAKER_00]: off employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, the employees lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Employees lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They potentially get on unemployment.
[SPEAKER_00]: State loses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We as taxpayers end up paying for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a slippery slope of continual
losses that there is really no winner in
[SPEAKER_00]: this game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned that there's a large
number of testing labs in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is, I imagine, some pressure of
labs to give favorable results in order
[SPEAKER_01]: to, like you said, keep their business
open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really unfortunate situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there is that high pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've faced that pressure myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be able to meet your
consumers or I should say your clientele's
[SPEAKER_00]: need without going into unscrupulous
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow it's not easy to stay in business,
but there are plenty of ways labs can stay
[SPEAKER_00]: in business as they sort of pivot around
cannabis testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is much more you can do apart from
potentially giving inflated potency
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that one of those ways that
labs can kind of provide more value to
[SPEAKER_01]: their clients is offering more R&D testing
or offering testing services that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily on the compliance panel,
like virus testing, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you can say if you've been
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Precisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're always looking for what
offers more value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this industry, we're only getting
to learn a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much more to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only learning a very tidbit of what
it has to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we're offering some value added
services like viral testing, HLVD,
[SPEAKER_00]: Beed Curly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking at stability testing,
something that folks are not really kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of, most folks are not paying attention
to, but they should be because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up as you start to talk about
expiry dating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you really determining that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it per ICS?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just going to be a very
high-priced guideline?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we start to offer some of those value
added services that are undervalued.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, kind of going back to the issue of
lab shopping and potency in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine part of the issue with that
too is just this idea that THC values are
[SPEAKER_01]: the determiner of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe if that weren't the case,
then there wouldn't be so much pressure in
[SPEAKER_01]: getting those high potency numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's really it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, you know, you go to your dispensary
and the first thing you see is usually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you have several shelves and
they have the top shelf and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC numbers that get highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting because the labs
do all this work to produce a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: COA with all these acids, terpenes and
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet the THC gets highlighted and
nobody apart from the buyers and sellers
[SPEAKER_00]: ever really gets to see that COA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really meant for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's a lot more in there that I
think we need to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of, I'm starting to do a
lot of work on some other compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as flavonoids, we know has some great
medicinal effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to push the attention away from THC,
you know, I'm starting to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: interestingly, even states starting to put
limits on THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a state like Mississippi that's
coming out with regulations that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually limiting their flour to 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, if those regulations
stick, when you test a flour that's above
[SPEAKER_00]: 30%, it's an automatic fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interesting thing is they're
adding in all the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the variants, THC Delta A and all of
the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that perhaps maybe it's
not such a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, especially when you consider that
flour testing, especially when you
[SPEAKER_01]: consider that flour is rarely ever higher
than 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really got to consider what is the
capacity, you know, how much it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of flour really produced,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking, we're talking in terms of
percent mass, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So 30% is really pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some reason, you know, there are folks
that grow 30% flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it gets pushed a little further
because we're doing by dry weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The labs are, the regulations that you
should test by dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say it's 30% and then you,
it's about 12%, 10% moisture and you add
[SPEAKER_00]: that in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It bumps it up to high 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're pushing 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can kind of see how,
you know, depending on how that moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: content on how that dry weight is,
is added back into the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to push those limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the real flour percentage really is
around maybe mid 20s, but then you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing 30 because of dry weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's funny too, when you said that
in Mississippi, if you test higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: 30% THC, you might fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might have some lab shopping going
the other way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting because that's
what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I guess if you grow anything good,
relatively good, don't go to Mississippi
[SPEAKER_00]: and sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lab shopping is going to be the
opposite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you consider that you'd have to,
yeah, add in all these other THC
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's not even just flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations state something about
concentrates being limited to 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forget how all these 90% vape pans and
isolates and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be interesting to see if
any other state kind of adopts those sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of regulations or if those Mississippi
regulations actually stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one of the interesting way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the interesting outcomes of
having multiple states enacting different
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like all these little test
kitchens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see how these regulations work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's sort of what
exacerbates the condition we're in with
[SPEAKER_00]: the different states having different
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, this multi-state
organizations may have producers in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain state, you know, they,
they look for certain type of results in
[SPEAKER_00]: another state.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look for another type of results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's got to be some kind of
concurrency in this result.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to start to be able to standardize
some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes back to standardization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in addition to your talk on
standardization, you're also participating
[SPEAKER_01]: on a panel discussion that's all about
nutrients and the role that they play in
[SPEAKER_01]: yield and cannabinoid output.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious from the testing lab
perspective, do you see a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation between certain nutrients that
are used and sort of the value that you
[SPEAKER_01]: see on your tests?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's very hard to pinpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do get client requests to sort of do a
nutrient analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what ends up happening is it's hard to
say for a fact that it was because of
[SPEAKER_00]: certain nutrient that you are having this
certain profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do try to do for some of the
nutrient analysis that are looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're looking for things like
calcium, magnesium, potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those is we have to sort of
determine a mass balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is your input?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're testing the runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're testing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is left in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to do sort of a mass
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, my plant is uptaking this much and
it's wasting this much or this much is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the runoff and see at what stages
is uptaking certain nutrients or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: just being, you know, washed off
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been quite difficult to exactly
say because you use a certain nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture that your terpenes were greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there's an effect, but I think
more research has to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely an effect on using high
quality nutrients and the right proportion
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients at the certain growth stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you have to consider that
it's not, you know, the same throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a pre-mixed new that you carry
throughout the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really interesting to note that,
yes, you know, something I meant to say
[SPEAKER_00]: was that when we talk about nutrients,
not just, you know, the beneficial one,
[SPEAKER_00]: so things like metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they happen to be in the nutrients,
the plants hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I found is that it's really cultivar
dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people do flushes at
the end, but we found that certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars like, for instance, cadmium will
hold on to that a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the same nutrients that
unfortunately contain cadmium was fed to
[SPEAKER_00]: your entire growth, different cultivars,
you'll find that there's varying levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: cadmium, some passing and some failing the
regulatory limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you do your final COA, just because
of how the plant actually holds on to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we know these plants as
bioaccumulators, but they can be released,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the residual levels are different per
certain cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of, it echoes the idea of the
entourage effect, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have multiple nutrients that are
kind of having the synergistic effect to
[SPEAKER_00]: help your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it plays throughout the whole
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even here at CAMHED, it takes all of
us from all the different disciplines,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the scientific directors here into
the medical professionals to all come
[SPEAKER_01]: together to better understand this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Covering all facets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the clinicians are learning from
the analytical chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning from the clinicians and
it's all being tied together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think any of our work can
be separated in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sort of have to work together because
you know, what we like and not the results
[SPEAKER_00]: are always tied together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I like to say this,
but somebody always said all boats rise in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tide and that's always clear in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great place to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks again, Iny, Chief Scientific
Officer of CureNSAFE.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it right this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again to our sponsors, Medicine
Women Health and the Hemp Coffee Exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
