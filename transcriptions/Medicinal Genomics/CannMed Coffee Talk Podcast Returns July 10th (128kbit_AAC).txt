[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everyone, Ben here with a quick
announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CanMed Coffee Talk podcast is
currently on hiatus, so the team can reset
[SPEAKER_00]: and recharge following the CanMed 24
Innovation and Investment Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be back with brand new episodes
starting July 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang tight!
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have some great guests lined up
that I think you're really going to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, I invite you to check
out any past episodes you may have missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all available at canmedevents.com
as well as your favorite podcast app.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please be sure to check out all the
video recordings of the past CanMed
[SPEAKER_00]: presentations in the CanMed archive at
canmedevents.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be adding the videos from the
CanMed 24 Summit to the archive very
[SPEAKER_00]: shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to sign up for email alerts to
get the notification when those go up and
[SPEAKER_00]: be one of the first to know when we
announce details about CanMed 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you back here in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
See you next time.
