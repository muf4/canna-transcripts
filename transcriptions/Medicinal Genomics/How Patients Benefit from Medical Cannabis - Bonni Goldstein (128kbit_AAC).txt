[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody and thank you for having
me and I just want to start off by saying
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you to the McKernan's and cortigen
and to Doug Kennedy for putting this
[SPEAKER_01]: together We're starting off with a video
that when Doug Kennedy approached me about
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking he wanted to do a Little vignette
on one of my patients who's had success
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't seen the video yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's all watch it together And I can
tell you more about the patient afterwards
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhonda molar my daughter is Malia she is
seven and She was diagnosed with autism at
[SPEAKER_00]: two years nine months.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't making eye contact She wasn't
responding to her name.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just was lost in her own world.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was very active So she would
constantly be running up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: She couldn't really sit down for very
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: She couldn't really stay focused on
anything We didn't want to try
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals But we were open to trying
anything that was alternative that might
[SPEAKER_00]: Not be so drastic, but maybe had some
changes in her behavior and we try
[SPEAKER_00]: restricting her diet for gluten We try
restricting, you know case in you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some things helped here and there but it
was nothing that helped With the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of her behavior There was a
discussion between some parents and I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: dr. Bonnie Goldstein's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made the appointment To go see her
and she was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: She explained the whole thing to me upon
her recommendation We tried a CBD oil
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: She told me well, let's try and add in the
THC THC is a psychoactive component of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis We found a ratio of THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it was this life-changing for my
daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She Began to sit down and focus her
aggression that she was experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: before the cannabis that was gone and I
started hearing feedback from Therapists
[SPEAKER_00]: and teachers asking me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, what's going on with your daughter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's no longer aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's no longer hitting students.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's no longer Spitting at people.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's no longer yelling at staff She's
sitting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's doing her work and I was so excited
that it was working and I didn't care
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care So I just started telling
people that this is what we were doing
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a family that came to me
fairly desperate Many of the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: come into my office are at that desperate
moment for this family She said they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't go anywhere with their child.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't go to the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't go to Chuck E Cheese Going
to school in the morning was you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: she woke up the mom was Woke up with dread
just getting their daughter out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: house and so you have to remember that
it's not just the patient that is
[SPEAKER_01]: struggling but the whole family and What's
amazing is I just saw this family a few
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks ago and this little girl graduated
from ABA therapy because there's no more
[SPEAKER_01]: therapy to correct or no more behaviors to
correct She's starting to speak and
[SPEAKER_01]: although they still have their challenges
their life has changed significantly this
[SPEAKER_01]: mom now has become a huge advocate and has
started a Facebook page for parents
[SPEAKER_01]: seeking help with Children with autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been collecting data and they have
data from over 850 families using cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're looking at the different
cannabis strains that are being used the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenoids the ratios trying to really
dial in on what's working best for these
[SPEAKER_01]: children and you know, I applaud this
family because they really Went past the
[SPEAKER_01]: fear They tried it out and like the mom
said it's been life-changing So so I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: medical director at Kana centers and
there's not a lot of time so let me Go
[SPEAKER_01]: through here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I opened my office in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two locations in Southern,
California We see somewhere between 250
[SPEAKER_01]: and 300 patients a month between the two
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember I live in a large metropolitan
City with millions of people, but also we
[SPEAKER_01]: get people from all over the world The
state and also some out-of-state patients
[SPEAKER_01]: as well Many of the most of these patients
are returning patients over the you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost decade that we've been there We see
about 20 to 40 new patients a month Our
[SPEAKER_01]: youngest patient was a six week old with a
devastating genetic illness Who started
[SPEAKER_01]: having seizures probably in utero first
documented seizure within two hours of
[SPEAKER_01]: birth and then our oldest patient my
oldest patient was a hundred year old a
[SPEAKER_01]: woman who Was probably on oh, I don't know
like 15 or 17 different medications And
[SPEAKER_01]: the family came to me and said is there
any possible way we could get her off some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these drugs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did do that successfully The
average age of adult patients is not 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 58 We are seeing a lot of baby
boomers coming in who are saying I do not
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be on these medications anymore
and I will tell you about 75% of patients
[SPEAKER_01]: come in are already on multiple
medications and they are looking to get
[SPEAKER_01]: off those medications because of either
side effects or that the drugs are
[SPEAKER_01]: ineffective or the Philosophically,
they just really don't want to take that
[SPEAKER_01]: many medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fine to take their blood pressure
medication or or their heart medication
[SPEAKER_01]: but to take sleeping pills on top of pain
pills on top of other kinds of Quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: life medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the biggest things that we
see in the practice and then definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing a changing demographic in
California I know some of my colleagues
[SPEAKER_01]: and I have talked about this where
initially when I started in this practice
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mostly people who were already
using cannabis and just wanted to be
[SPEAKER_01]: legally They no longer wanted to be part
of a illicit drug market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now what we're seeing is people who
are what we call cannabis naive They've
[SPEAKER_01]: not used cannabis, but they're seeing it
as a possibility and I'll have I'm very
[SPEAKER_01]: happy to say that in the last two years
I've gotten more referrals from mainstream
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians like rheumatologists
oncologists and neurologists Than ever
[SPEAKER_01]: before and so I really think that cannabis
is now becoming accepted and it's no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer fringe Here's a list of adult
conditions I'm not going to go Through all
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think about what dr. Mishulam
talked about this morning about the
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution of receptors it corresponds
with the diseases that we're seeing in a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis practice and so by far my
adult patients are chronic pain I would
[SPEAKER_01]: say the top three are pain anxiety
insomnia, which all run together And then
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, we're seeing a lot of patients
with autoimmune disease as well as cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: In pediatrics, it's a it's a little
shorter list By far treatment resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: epilepsy and autism are the two most
common conditions Although I am seeing a
[SPEAKER_01]: fair amount of patients being referred for
advanced cancers But I will also tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: that a couple of the local children's
hospitals are now referring patients for
[SPEAKER_01]: symptomatic relief of nausea vomiting
weight loss and pain Because we can really
[SPEAKER_01]: do some nice things with very low dose CBD
THC a and THC and these children who are
[SPEAKER_01]: really struggling who are nonverbal for
the most part and they're Not able to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: their parents they feel lousy from the
chemo or from the radiation And so we are
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing a lot of those kids being referred
in And again part of it is the parents
[SPEAKER_01]: asking as well when they're at the
doctor's office Are you okay if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this and I'm definitely seeing an
openness that we did not see before I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: also seeing a fair amount of patients with
pandas and pans and I'm again because of
[SPEAKER_01]: time I can't go into that but this is a
pediatric autoimmune disease that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: very quite devastating Attacks normal
healthy children and is is really
[SPEAKER_01]: devastating to the family And we are
seeing some really nice response most of
[SPEAKER_01]: these kids I have a couple of families
where the children were actually
[SPEAKER_01]: Institutionalized and we've been able to
get them out and back functioning in
[SPEAKER_01]: society Now the goals of treatment pretty
common everything that we think that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis does medically so pain relief
alleviating anxiety depression and
[SPEAKER_01]: improving sleep helping appetite Lessening
nausea vomiting gut symptoms now a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people don't think about enhanced focus
and concentration But if you have an
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid deficiency and you're
suffering with ADD But also autism and
[SPEAKER_01]: other conditions where you can't focus
Remember the baseline status of the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system is going to dictate
how you respond for many of these people
[SPEAKER_01]: They say I'm able to do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to go to work I'm able to study
at school parents are reporting to me also
[SPEAKER_01]: that their children are doing much better
in school and of course Reducing and
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminating seizures when we see patients
who have intractable seizure disorder But
[SPEAKER_01]: there's also other other goals of
treatment and kind of behind the scenes
[SPEAKER_01]: Apart from just feeling better at the
moment that you take cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also seeing some long-term effects
mostly anti-inflammatory and neuro
[SPEAKER_01]: protection Anti-tumor and many patients
just report and we even have a space on my
[SPEAKER_01]: intake form How does cannabis affect your
quality of life and people actually write?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a sense of well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel better and sometimes it's hard
to put it into words Less pain is easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general having just a better
quality of life and feeling better this is
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from balancing your endocannabinoid
system and Achieving that and I will say
[SPEAKER_01]: that their cannabis is not the only thing
that will balance your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system and my colleague Dustin Sulak from
Maine At his table out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a wonderful I actually Brought it
up here Endocannabinoid diet and
[SPEAKER_01]: activities other things that can enhance
your endocannabinoid system So I do
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage people to look at that because
it's not just cannabis cannabis is a piece
[SPEAKER_01]: of the puzzle But one of the main things
is we you know, we can talk about Pain
[SPEAKER_01]: scales and these kinds of things but one
of the things that I see in my practice
[SPEAKER_01]: that I find really important Is that when
people come into my office who are
[SPEAKER_01]: desperate they have lost control of their
daily life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not participating with family
with work in their social activities
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise and what happens is it starts to
spiral out of control and What I'm finding
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis is that even though the
medical condition is not being cured
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening is that shift of power
that control is going back to the patient
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to manage their condition
with less side effects They're not worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about the medication long term that
they're putting into their body and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: simple They take a little bit and it works
and if they feel well They can skip it
[SPEAKER_01]: without worrying about feeling a
withdrawal the next day or even for a week
[SPEAKER_01]: and so that that power play between the
medical condition being in control versus
[SPEAKER_01]: You have in control of your life I think
is one of the most very important
[SPEAKER_01]: essential things that I see in this
particular kind of specialty and
[SPEAKER_01]: Improvement of quality of life and a lot
of people come in and say I'm not better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have cancer I still have anxiety,
but I'm in control I am no longer being
[SPEAKER_01]: led around by my medical condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very important that we that we
acknowledge that Now here's a patient
[SPEAKER_01]: report.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a 36 year old female came into my
office in 2013 Ten-year history of
[SPEAKER_01]: fibromyalgia insomnia and anxiety and as
you can imagine she was having frequent
[SPEAKER_01]: bouts of depression You can see her list
of multiple medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: She came in with a big baggie and she said
I'm on all this and it's not working I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel terrible and she was extremely
nervous because the type of work she did
[SPEAKER_01]: She did not want to be outed as a cannabis
user and within a week of seeing her I got
[SPEAKER_01]: this email Where she sums it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I came in to see you last week and went
straight to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means she was pretty desperate I've
been trying all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for my insomnia and pain I'm very
excited to report that my pain levels have
[SPEAKER_01]: gone down so much that I feel like a
normal person again I don't even have to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it every day It lasts for two to three
days and that is something that I see is
[SPEAKER_01]: that patients don't have to medicaid all
the time I will tell you 80% of my
[SPEAKER_01]: patients are nighttime users of cannabis
and probably At least 50% do not medicaid
[SPEAKER_01]: every day And then she wrote my my whole
life has changed Thank you And I just saw
[SPEAKER_01]: her probably maybe three months ago,
and she's continued to do well and in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: when she comes in she's like I'm fine I
want to talk about my brother who needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: come see you so So it's almost as and she
I she still has her conditions It's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just that they're well managed and they're
easily managed with cannabis and then
[SPEAKER_01]: here's a more recent Patient who just came
to see me last year a 44 year old female
[SPEAKER_01]: with severe migraines She did not respond
to many pharmaceuticals and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting is she worked for one of the
large?
[SPEAKER_01]: Entertainment movie companies out in
California and she was kind of a big wig
[SPEAKER_01]: there But her migraines were so
debilitating that she had to take a leave
[SPEAKER_01]: of absence and that was devastating to her
she was trying so hard not to miss work
[SPEAKER_01]: and she had told me she was missing at
least two to three days a week and they
[SPEAKER_01]: told her You know you can't we have to you
know, we're not getting the work done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to ask you to take time off and so
she was super stressed when she came to
[SPEAKER_01]: see me not only from the pain and the
years of this but also from the financial
[SPEAKER_01]: hit she was taking by not working and So
here's the email from her.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been almost eight weeks since I saw
you I just want to give you an update the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD oil has been a miracle in controlling
my chronic migraines I've only had three
[SPEAKER_01]: very mild migraines since starting the
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a huge improvement To the 10 plus
migraines I was getting monthly I've
[SPEAKER_01]: titrated up to about 80 milligrams daily
and that's important because you notice
[SPEAKER_01]: it's two months in we start low dose and
we titrate up and this is where she found
[SPEAKER_01]: a good spot and she adds a couple of drops
of THC when I feel the migraines coming on
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely feel more relaxed overall and
finally have quality restful sleep And I
[SPEAKER_01]: was happy to I'm very happy to say that
she went back to work after four months of
[SPEAKER_01]: starting cannabis oil Now in children I've
listed here quotes from emails and text
[SPEAKER_01]: messages from families I won't go through
all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you can see, they're all pretty
impressive The big things are that what I
[SPEAKER_01]: am seeing in pediatrics and you know,
I talked last year We don't know about
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term effects, but we know what
long-term effects of of intractable
[SPEAKER_01]: seizures do we know what long-term effects
of a child who is autistic at a young age
[SPEAKER_01]: and unable to participate in therapy and
then becomes a teenager and gets large
[SPEAKER_01]: size and and and difficult to control and
so what I'm seeing is that when someone is
[SPEAKER_01]: a responder what we're seeing is is a
child moving forward in life and I write
[SPEAKER_01]: in my book about a little girl who came to
me at nine years of age who was not
[SPEAKER_01]: reading and writing and I Write in the
book that she came to me and read me a
[SPEAKER_01]: book and wrote her name in cursive And
that was a huge accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am seeing I do not see children
regressing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see children Children's brains
progressing to reach their full potential
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever that may be for that particular
child And here's a patient report.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Thomas and the Thomas's mom has
given me permission to talk about him This
[SPEAKER_01]: is a young boy who was born with a
congenital brain malformation and he was
[SPEAKER_01]: having intractable seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: He One of the main things that they came
in for was the seizures But the second
[SPEAKER_01]: thing was the severe self-injurious
behavior and so he had came in wearing arm
[SPEAKER_01]: braces so that he couldn't bend his arms
so his hands couldn't be by his face
[SPEAKER_01]: because I saw pictures that the mom showed
me of black eyes and Hematomas on his ears
[SPEAKER_01]: that they had to take him to the emergency
room to get drained.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean he was really beating himself up He
also had severe acid reflux to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: where the family walked around with little
cups To catch his vomit all day long The
[SPEAKER_01]: mom said they went through thousands and
thousands of cups every year and he was
[SPEAKER_01]: also unable to walk He had tried ten
different Seizure medications we started
[SPEAKER_01]: him on cannabis oil at age seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was February 2015 and again,
we start low dose and we titrate up it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes time He was also on seizure
medications that were being weaned off But
[SPEAKER_01]: he had complete resolution of vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just a perk the mom was thrilled
with that but he had 90% reduction of
[SPEAKER_01]: seizures and continues to have that and
then It can you play this video for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Thomas who oh Yep, or maybe I can
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it and this is Thomas he learned to
walk unassisted I Can get it to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mom sent me this video Because she
was just so shocked and surprised
[SPEAKER_02]: Thomas over here Come here Thomas come
here Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come over here Good job T.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look you want to see friend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on There's Mario come on keep going
[SPEAKER_01]: And so apparently he discovered the mirror
and like to go look at himself so And this
[SPEAKER_01]: was a kid that really everybody had
written off And so one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: the mom said in the last visit was not
only is it keep getting better She says I
[SPEAKER_01]: have no idea what it what the next year is
gonna bring it just keeps getting better
[SPEAKER_01]: and better and I think part of it is Where
we want to see, you know more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: balance and allow him to reach His
potential because I just don't think that
[SPEAKER_01]: we know and you know I thought about what
dr. Mishulam said in his video and he said
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these kids are being saved and I
We really don't know what the future holds
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is a whole new brand brand
new generation of children that are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting intervention with cannabis Now I
don't have a lot of time to go over this
[SPEAKER_01]: but in California we have lots of
different oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no restrictions Some people say
that's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: My patients can get medicine and so I have
divvied up The cannabis medicine into four
[SPEAKER_01]: different groups just based on the main
cannabinoids the dominant cannabinoids of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC rich in the top left bottom left is
the high ratio CBD to THC bottom right is
[SPEAKER_01]: the low ratio CBD to THC and the top right
is the raw cannabinoids because basically
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients need a roadmap.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I what's in this product knife
people come in who say oh I've tried just
[SPEAKER_01]: about everything and I came to you because
I have a card but nothing's working and
[SPEAKER_01]: really all they've tried is just one of
These categories because they don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: how to read labels and they're not sure
what they're getting And so when you break
[SPEAKER_01]: it up like this, it gives a patient a
roadmap of different things to try I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna go real quick here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are various products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see they're all labeled and in
California We went from not very many
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled things about eight years ago To
now we're seeing labeled and also January
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's going to be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on the market So we've really made
some progress in that regard These are I
[SPEAKER_01]: was just going to mention the turpinoids
very important, especially in pediatric
[SPEAKER_01]: patients it appears linalool and myrcine
both very calming are excellent for
[SPEAKER_01]: children with epilepsy and autism and Then
people often ask me which cannabinoid I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know I can make an educated guess
but your body's gonna respond and so For
[SPEAKER_01]: most patients you have to have a wide
variety of choices so that person can find
[SPEAKER_01]: what works best for Them and then this is
why we should have cannabis right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sums it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much You You
