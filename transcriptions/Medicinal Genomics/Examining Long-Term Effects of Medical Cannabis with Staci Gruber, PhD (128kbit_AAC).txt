[SPEAKER_02]: Our guest today is Dr. Stacy Gruber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stacy is the Director of the Cognitive and
Clinical Neuroimaging Care at McLean
[SPEAKER_02]: Hospital's Brain Imaging Center and an
Associate Professor of Psychiatry at
[SPEAKER_02]: Harvard Medical School.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stacy launched Marijuana Investigations
for Neuroscientific Discovery,
[SPEAKER_02]: or MIND, in 2014, the first-ever program
of its kind designed to clarify the
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term impact of medical cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_02]: MIND supports numerous projects that aim
to address the impact of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: on a number of important variables,
including cognition, brain structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: and function, clinical state, quality of
life, pain, sleep, and other
[SPEAKER_02]: health-related measures.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Director of MIND, Dr. Gruber has
generated major contributions to the field
[SPEAKER_02]: as the first to assess medical cannabis
patients longitudinally, first to acquire
[SPEAKER_02]: neuroimaging data in medical cannabis
patients, and as principal investigator of
[SPEAKER_02]: the first clinical trial to do a
full-spectrum, high CBD product,
[SPEAKER_02]: which she specifically formulated to treat
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, novel clinical trials have
been approved and are pending or currently
[SPEAKER_02]: underway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at CanMed 25, Stacy will share
findings from those clinical trials as an
[SPEAKER_02]: oral presenter.
[SPEAKER_02]: During our conversation, we discussed some
key findings from the MIND program's
[SPEAKER_02]: longitudinal studies on medical cannabis
use, including improved cognitive
[SPEAKER_02]: performance and reductions in pain,
anxiety, and sleep disturbances,
[SPEAKER_02]: the ongoing clinical trials the MIND
program is conducting on anxiety,
[SPEAKER_02]: bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's,
the Women's Health Initiative at MIND,
[SPEAKER_02]: or WIM, which is investigating cannabis
for gynecological pain, menopause,
[SPEAKER_02]: and endometriosis, concerns about
mislabeled cannabis products and
[SPEAKER_02]: unregulated hemp-derived products,
and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation with
Stacy, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, Healer.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Healer is a trusted, physician-developed
medicinal cannabis brand founded to
[SPEAKER_02]: address the challenges of helping people
and health providers get the best results
[SPEAKER_02]: with safe, reliably dosable products and
education on how best to use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Healer hemp products are available
nationwide and include a step-by-step
[SPEAKER_02]: usage guide and response tracker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Healer's distinctive product formulations
and education are based on the latest
[SPEAKER_02]: research and work of leading cannabis
clinician, Dr. Dustin Sulak.
[SPEAKER_02]: For more information, visit Healer.com or
HealerCBD.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stacy Gruber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Stacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are excited to have you on the podcast
and thrilled to have you back at CanMed
[SPEAKER_02]: this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you were back with us way back
at Harvard Medical School and then came
[SPEAKER_02]: out to Pasadena as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it took a few years off,
but now we're excited to have you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your presentation will share data from
several clinical trials that you and your
[SPEAKER_02]: team are performing as part of the MIND
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's probably a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a bit about the MIND program,
why it was founded and how its 10 years of
[SPEAKER_02]: research have led you to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, I will say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to be heading back to CanMed
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I was part of early, early CanMed
meetings and thought and still think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really one of the best meetings there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a great opportunity to
interact with people from lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas related to cannabis and
cannabinoid base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the MIND program did just celebrate its
10 year anniversary, which seems odd to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you, I spent several decades
looking, among other things, at the impact
[SPEAKER_00]: of recreational cannabis on different
aspects of function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cognitive performance and clinical
outcome, measures of brain structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: function, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had done lots of different studies,
again, looking at the impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Massachusetts was on the
precipice of legalizing medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I scoured the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, let me see, what do we know
about the long-term effects of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you probably know, cannabis was
re-legalized in this country in 1996 in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And despite that, interestingly enough,
there really was nothing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature, nothing at all about long-term
effects of medical cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some evidence for certain types of
studies that looked at sort of a quick and
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty, if you will, assessment of
cognition as part of a different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: very short type of study, but nothing that
was long-term, nothing that followed
[SPEAKER_00]: patients over time, and certainly nothing
that looked at cognition or clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes as a primary focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I launched marijuana investigations
for neuroscientific discovery or the MIND
[SPEAKER_00]: program with the singular focus of looking
at the long-term impact of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I think a number of
people were sort of like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can try to look at these folks over
time, but these are primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are really just looking for a
legal way to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first and foremost, I would say that
that was absolutely, positively untrue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it then, and now I can really point
to you and say, absolutely, it's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been an extremely important
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's still the only one like it in
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's home to what we call a number of
firsts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the first ever to do long-term
assessments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at patients before they begin
using medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have different types of
indications or conditions, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic pain, anxiety, or mood disruption,
sleep disruption, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we look at them before they begin
using medical cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we follow them over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use any and all products they would
like to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have those products analyzed by an
outside lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know, quote, what's in your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because it's not a clinical trial
and I'm not controlling what's given to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we can, of course, look at their
exposure to different cannabinoids over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, which is incredibly helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, we're looking at primary
outcomes like chronic pain, like mood,
[SPEAKER_00]: like sleep, and then, of course,
measures of cognitive performance and,
[SPEAKER_00]: thankfully, measures of brain structure,
function, quality of life, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, again, some of these
firsts that MIND has sort of been
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunate enough to put on the map should
be really just what I would call the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we're the first ever to look at
long-term outcome and cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: performance and first ever to do imaging,
first to do some of these clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of which are informed by these
long-term observational studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell us the directions that we need
to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients have always been our greatest
source of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lead the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We follow them, which is a little
backwards in terms of medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not usual, but we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been an incredibly rewarding time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the program is, unbelievably
helpful and now has really expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a great journey so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned there was a lack of
long-term studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long are we talking?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the types of longitudinal
studies that we're doing, if you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature, again, we were looking at
legalization here in Massachusetts in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012, and there was nothing in literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first studies were designed to look at
individuals up to one year and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of people say, good luck,
they'll never stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have the opposite problem,
which is that once we begin looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: people over time and establish
relationships and people come in and we
[SPEAKER_00]: have these very comprehensive assessments,
they're interested in staying connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started off looking at outcome
between baseline and three months,
[SPEAKER_00]: six months, 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every month our team contacts them and
we get an idea of what they're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they're using frequency, magnitude,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these in-depth assessments at the end
of the milestone visits, then we went out
[SPEAKER_00]: to two years, then three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're following people all the way out
to five years, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what are you finding with some of
these long-term studies?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first longitudinal observational study
was pretty general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to limit it to people with
any specific indication, although I had
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about it, like maybe just folks
with pain or just folks with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a psychiatric hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we do 24 seven, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All psychiatry all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought opening it up again,
the top three conditions for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use in this country are chronic
pain, anxiety and mood disruption,
[SPEAKER_00]: then sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually what we see in our
cohorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would tell you that the most
interesting sort of big take home messages
[SPEAKER_00]: from the longitudinal observational
studies so far is that first and foremost,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of people before they begin using
their medical cannabis regimen and over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, generally do not perform worse on
cognitive tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they look, if anything,
they look stable or slightly better from a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical perspective, which is the most
important thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at how they do and how they
feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self-report measures are helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examiner driven measures are helpful,
but really this is primarily up to what
[SPEAKER_00]: they think and how they feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They generally report having less chronic
pain, having less anxiety, less sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: disruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So easier to fall asleep, better sleep
coherence or the ability to stay asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also hugely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see a drop in conventional
medication use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this isn't me saying, Hey,
listen, now that you're on conventional,
[SPEAKER_00]: now that you're on medical cannabis,
you should stop with the opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the folks doing it on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are medical cannabis patients who
say, I don't need the same level of oxy
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually need any of that drug or
this drunk at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all we're doing is really,
I always say, I'm just your faithful
[SPEAKER_00]: scribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just keeping track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just following you over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these precipitous drops in opioids,
over-the-counter analgesics or pain
[SPEAKER_00]: relievers and benzodiazepines,
which people often use for things like
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety or sleep, really interesting to
see them drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, no one's asking them to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the pain realm, we certainly see folks
having less chronic pain and less
[SPEAKER_00]: disruption from pain in terms of how much
their pain distresses them or disrupts
their sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their lives, how much they feel it's a
disability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a patient group that we call
treatment as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are patients with the same
indications and conditions as our medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis patients, but who aren't using
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We follow those folks over time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great comparison group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have chronic pain or anxiety or
sleep disorder, whatever they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really see the same pattern of
change over time in those groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not using cannabis to treat
their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within subjects, we see changes between
baseline and three months, six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you look at the aggregate
group of medical cannabis patients
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to treatment as usual,
you don't really see the same patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, and you mentioned too that you're
just a scribe and you're just notating
[SPEAKER_02]: what the patients are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't give any recommendations in
terms of dosage or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that becomes a really interesting set
of questions with patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, individuals who
have a fair amount of expertise and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge in cannabis and cannabinoid
based therapies, of course we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones helping people when they don't
know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, patients decide on their own
regimens and they may get advice or
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback on the types of products,
but it's not a situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually I believe it violates federal
law for any of us to say, listen,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how you should take it,
what you should take it, where you should
[SPEAKER_00]: get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may provide some types of feedback,
but in terms of guidance, it's generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're generally choosing the types of
products that they're interested in using.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may help guide them with regard to
specific questions that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I avoid having this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't want to be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just, I would just like to relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, but I don't, I definitely don't
want to be high because I have this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this, this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're looking for a product that's
not exclusively high in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these kinds of things, but it's never a
specific here's what to do and how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go to jail for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And orange, if orange weren't the new
black, it would be a different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you finding that, you know,
certain indications gravitate towards
[SPEAKER_02]: certain formulations of cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that in general, there are some
perceptions and sort of among the general
[SPEAKER_00]: public, like, you know, if I have chronic
pain, I have to have a product that has
[SPEAKER_00]: this amount of, let's say THC or this
ratio of THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people often think that, it's going to
be more of a one size fits all than it
[SPEAKER_00]: really winds up being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many individual factors come into play
here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So your own experience with cannabis or
cannabinoids, what other medications you
[SPEAKER_00]: take, because there are some pretty
stunning potential drug, drug interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: and anything that's swallowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worry about that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once we digest it, it has to pass
through the liver and things are converted
[SPEAKER_00]: into other, into other compounds,
genetic liability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have a first degree relative who
has a history of psychosis?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be careful about super high THC
products or even high THC products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot to be mindful of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, I think people are generally
very interested, at least in our studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: in not necessarily being intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say this because we developed a metric
called Cannacount, get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannacount, like Cannacount, where we can
actually quantify individual cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regardless of the product type,
whether it's an oil or an edible or a vape
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge, we can quantify how much of
each of the cannabinoids you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to in a given week, depending on
how much and how often you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at that data over time,
overwhelmingly, these folks are exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: more non-intoxicating cannabinoids like
CBD than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not really looking exclusively
to be, to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're seeing more and more of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would like to feel better,
but not necessarily to not feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Noah, one of the things that you mentioned
too, that kind of stood out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that there's been some talk
recently on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that our chief science officer
is sort of weighed in on it as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that there's kind of this growing,
how do I phrase it?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a growing concern about using too
much cannabis leading to psychiatric
[SPEAKER_02]: disorders like schizophrenia or things
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you mentioned whether or
not someone has a history or family
[SPEAKER_02]: history of that, just wondering,
I mean, given your expertise, if you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to weigh in on sort of what the risks are
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that probably is its own show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should do our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take this on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, we're going to take this
on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot to be mindful of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, there, there is no question that
cannabis and cannabinoids, if you ask me,
[SPEAKER_00]: have remarkable therapeutic potential
across the board, depending on who you
[SPEAKER_00]: are, where you are in life, what else
you're using, quote, what's in your weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwhelmingly, when we think of risk
factors, we think of individuals who are
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first and foremost, the group that
leaps to mind and everybody, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for everybody, adolescents and emerging
adults, where we have neurodevelopmental
[SPEAKER_00]: vulnerability, the brain is, for my
cannabis audiences, their brains are
[SPEAKER_00]: half-baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not quite done under construction,
whatever euphemism you want, the brain's
[SPEAKER_00]: not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like any other substance,
not just cannabis, but other substances
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol, illness, injury, brain is
vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so exposure to different types of
things during that period of time may
[SPEAKER_00]: result in something that's not necessarily
optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does appear that the presence of THC
may impact, um, neuronal trajectories
[SPEAKER_00]: during development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's all sorts of things that
have been discussed and assessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does appear that high amounts of
different types of cannabinoids during
[SPEAKER_00]: this vulnerable time may not result in the
most optimal outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it true for everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we draw the line?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the age.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we also are mindful on the other
end of the age spectrum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fastest growing group of cannabis
consumers across this country,
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals over 60 or 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have slowed metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individuals in that age bracket are
generally on several conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: medications, somewhere between three and
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drug-drug interactions are a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and we're mindful of clearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think when we think of the risks,
we want to take a big picture look in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of psychosis and psychiatric
disorders and conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there has been a fair amount
that's been published with regard to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that there appear to be associations
between cannabis use and different
[SPEAKER_00]: psychiatric conditions, symptoms,
or clusters, not necessarily causation,
[SPEAKER_00]: exacerbation of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Causation, not so much, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think people don't always hear
that part of the message just because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people who don't necessarily
feel so great or comfortable in their own
[SPEAKER_00]: skin are more likely to use things to
quote, escape their current state of being
[SPEAKER_00]: or to feel different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean that that's what caused
it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So important distinction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so kind of, I guess, kind of circling
up on the longitudinal or observational
[SPEAKER_02]: studies, what are the limitations of these
sort of studies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Longitudinal studies or observational
studies in general have lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations, um, including the most
obvious, which is that you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily always say that what you're
seeing that's different over time as a
[SPEAKER_00]: result of just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people implement, uh,
or, you know, sort of start a new cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: or medical cannabis regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, they're also doing
other things potentially that we wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know it's just the medical
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do your best to control for
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask that people don't start other
medications or this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do your best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not as powerful or as clear cut
as a clinical trial where we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: a specific study drug or series of study
drugs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That I have formulated in the case of my
clinical trials, I formulate the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: products used in observational studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually patients are using whatever they
choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great that we can actually get,
um, laboratory analysis of quote,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in their weed, but it would be a
little bit better if we knew sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: operate what we were giving and how.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're looking at something before and
then after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little less clear, but that
said, I mean, again, these longer-term
[SPEAKER_00]: studies really give us a trajectory of
what people look like over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly enough, individuals in
our clinical trials very often,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, wind up signing up for the
observational side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get to see those people long-term
and how they do after being on a clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trial and then sort of migrating or
evolving into a different type of therapy,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a conventional, uh, a more
conventional, um, therapy or a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis product that's in the marketplace
and what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually compare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there's the shortcomings with
every type of approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do the best that you can, but I tell
you this, if you don't look, you don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I, I have a very strongly held
belief that real world patients using real
[SPEAKER_00]: world products give us a really good sense
of real world outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that type of data helps guide me when
I'm thinking of the next stage for
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials, like, Ooh, patients say
they're using this and not that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's why we should be thinking about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a lot of folks complain about this,
this, this, we should look at that there
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they really are guiding the charge in
many cases, as opposed to somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: discovering something, you know,
at their, at their bench and going,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, we should try this in this
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go, we should look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've mentioned a few times that
you're actually testing the products that
[SPEAKER_02]: the, uh, that the patients are using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is that each time that they get,
uh, a new, uh, a new product or how,
[SPEAKER_02]: how frequently?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been a bit more variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tend to test their most commonly
used products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So patients very often, again,
our real medical cannabis patient cohort
[SPEAKER_00]: that says, look, I have XYZ one,
two, three, I'm looking to treat these
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they find something that works,
which generally happens, but as you've
[SPEAKER_00]: probably know, there's a little bit of
trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't sample that necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to get it when they have a,
when they have a regimen that really does
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be consistent in that they deal is
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, otherwise you're looking at nothing
but sort of change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we test, um, every time, of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I could somehow, you know,
give every single person some kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bench top thing, they gave me a
printout of exactly, but that'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do our best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still better than what we had,
which was oh yeah, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, I think that's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my least favorite thing to find in the
literature by some of the most esteemed
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues I could ever imagine is that
people ask questions about individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use, but they never ask about the
actual constituents within the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because no matter what you're seeing,
good or bad, we don't necessarily know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's always driving that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you ask patients or recreational
consumers to guesstimate my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, well, tell us what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do you think it was strong weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever met anybody who says,
yeah, I've really crap weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awful garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one says I ditch weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one, but it's sort of like other things
that people may overestimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what I mean, it can't always
be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be great if when people say
we're looking at, you know, very high THC
[SPEAKER_00]: product use in this cohort that you
actually confirm their products are in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact very high in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen that too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes more recently we're seeing some
of that, but that's a limitation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving on to the clinical trials,
as we mentioned, uh, you have a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: different clinical trials that are going
on, looking at things like anxiety,
[SPEAKER_02]: bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's related
dementia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so when you could share some
details about that, I know you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be talking about it at Can Med,
so you probably don't want to give away
[SPEAKER_02]: too much, but, uh, what you are willing to
share, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm, I'm willing to share plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, our very first clinical trial was
designed to look at patients with moderate
[SPEAKER_00]: to severe anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was designed to be a whole plant
full spectrum product with a relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: high amount of CBD compared for sure to
THC, but not no THC, not a broad spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: product, but full spectrum product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it was designed to be a relatively
short trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we actually wound up having three
arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a whole plant full spectrum
product, um, and a placebo, and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, an actual isolate that comes from that
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just any old isolate that's CBD,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: An actual CBD isolate that came from the
same base from which the study product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That study is wrapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just enrolled our last patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've published the open label data,
which I will review probably at Can Med.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that was the very first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it's been a really, really,
um, important study or set of studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The open label really helped to inform the
double blind phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then did the same type of study with an
industry partner using a hemp based
[SPEAKER_00]: product that we're in the process of
writing up now with regard to open label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anxiety features into so many different
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a really important thing to
assess in people with lots of different,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, either general medical conditions or
psychiatric conditions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just primary anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's people with, um, for example,
patients with glioblastoma and incurable
[SPEAKER_00]: brain tumor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredibly serious and lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at chronic pain and anxiety,
and then, and exploratory aim is tumor
[SPEAKER_00]: progression because if we've done it
right, maybe knock on wood, maybe we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: help to slow or even stop the progression
of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's every indication based on
preclinical work, um, that, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially possible here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have the very first study,
uh, of patients with bipolar disorder
[SPEAKER_00]: using a whole plant broad spectrum
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, you know, I think there's,
there's lots of different, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways to get at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's so many different
areas of interest these days and so much
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, or so many of them overlap and
intersect, but they are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we've, we've certainly learned a
lot in patients who have Alzheimer's
[SPEAKER_00]: related dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very often they do have anxiety,
um, along with other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and how does that necessary,
how, how can a product that's high in CPD
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe contains some THC, but not a
ton, although some people like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC in that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how do those folks look over,
over a period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things you know, it's
important to have empirically sound data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how did you go about, you know,
kind of deciding what the formulation
[SPEAKER_02]: would be for some of these indications?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so for the first one, I knew I had
actually come across a product in
[SPEAKER_00]: California that I thought would be
particularly promising that actually is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis based product, but would have
meant the definition at that time for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is way back when, way, way,
way, way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and when I wrote my first IND and was
approved by the FDA and our IRB,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, that product would have meant the
definition of industrial hemp and the DEA
[SPEAKER_00]: came along and said, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think we can approve, except you can't
use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not like you could go to a
candy machine and say, instead of a
[SPEAKER_00]: Snickers, I'm going to get a KitKat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to go back to the drawing
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I knew that I wanted something that
was a whole plant full spectrum product,
[SPEAKER_00]: given, um, the likely impact of some of
the so-called minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the question was how to do it in
such a way that would be palatable,
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerable, and likely efficacious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, whether you're going to use
an emulsion or an infusion, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm a neuroscientist,
I'm not a chemist necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I spend a lot of time now,
um, um, with, with compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals, and it's been some of the most
glorious work I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but really it has to do with trying to
understand how to best leverage some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these naturally occurring compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole goal of mind with regards to
the clinical child's arm is to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: explore, and I wouldn't, the term exploit
sounds, um, unfortunately negative,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to, to, to really leverage the
potential therapeutics of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: of these compounds and reduce risk and
harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really want people super
altered.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many cases, they really can't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so that's, that's sort of the
trick, mitigate risk and harm,
[SPEAKER_00]: but increase the likelihood of clinical
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So high CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, if you're saying that it would
have kind of fit the definition for
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial hemp, then it's below that 0.3%
THC.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first study was conducted using a
product that I created that has,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you could have had 10 times the
amount of THC in that product and still
[SPEAKER_00]: been below the limit after four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of my sample tested positive for THC
on urinary drug assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would have, they would have failed
the urine screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one of them, of course, was
intoxicated or altered sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: underscoring the importance of why we
can't use a per se law.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, like the presence of this
means they're intoxicated or impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one person reported feeling altered or
intoxicated or altered at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yes, that, that product is
technically cannabis, but it just so
[SPEAKER_00]: happens to have extremely low levels of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trust me, when I tell you it was
sourced, my original thing was sourced by
[SPEAKER_00]: NIDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't give me anything that was
turnkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me a, um, it was a rather sludgy
oil based product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that was a challenge, I would say
diplomatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a family friendly show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was a challenge to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was not the easiest thing
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we did wind up making it into a
sublingual tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: My feeling is sublingual tinctures are
probably the way to go for these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least, um, that's been where we've
spent a fair amount of time because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: increased bioavailability that's afforded
that way, as opposed to taking a capsule
[SPEAKER_00]: or just swallowing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so have you encountered any regulatory
or logistical?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you mentioned some of the
logistical hurdles, but regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: hurdles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the fact that they said,
you know, the FDA, once the FDA approves
[SPEAKER_00]: it, the IND, then you have to actually
post your clinical trial information on
[SPEAKER_00]: something called clinical trials.gov and
patients who are rather desperate across
[SPEAKER_00]: the country are, you know, sort of living
on these sites and they'll call you and
[SPEAKER_00]: sign up and say, let me in, let me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The IRB had approved it, but of course the
DEA said, not so fast, Gruber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a bit of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and a rather untenable position to
have been placed because you have patients
[SPEAKER_00]: who are desperate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have product that's made, but I can't
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't use any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have it on the top shelf of my
office because it's a reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never count your chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it took, I mean, a quick, you know,
just a quick, um, what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost two years, uh, from that point
until we actually enrolled our first
[SPEAKER_00]: patient when I had to go back to the
drawing board and start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that was a little bit of a
hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, certainly a mogul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, you know, was that the thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, listen, we have had extremely good and
positive interactions with each of the
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies and they've been very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for many, many reasons,
there was a lot of learning that had to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I think I understood a little
bit better than they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to help them along and it took a
long time and I'm still, we're still not
[SPEAKER_00]: really where we need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's any surprise,
but I, that was a bit of a challenge to be
[SPEAKER_02]: honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you mentioned you're sort of
comparing the full spectrum products to
[SPEAKER_02]: the isolates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what sort of differences and results
are you seeing there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't actually analyzed that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we just enrolled our last,
so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: My feeling is that a whole plant full
spectrum product would be more efficacious
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to placebo for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And likely more, more efficacious than the
isolate form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an isolate from that same distillate,
which is not at all what you see when you
[SPEAKER_00]: see isolate arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, and people say,
well, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter where you get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think necessarily that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be my guess, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, certainly we see a lot of clinical
benefit in individuals who are using a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant full or broad spectrum
relative to people who are using quote,
[SPEAKER_00]: just CBD or just something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably for good reasons mechanistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I did want to ask you about,
um, the women's health initiative at mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's mentioned in your abstract as
something that you guys are looking into
[SPEAKER_02]: or sort of expanding into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so please share about that and sort of
what, what conditions are you looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wim or the women's health initiative at
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted something that was catchy
where I could say, not just a whim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, over a billion,
over a billion individuals are affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: things like gynecologic pain in this
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's largely understudied.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an underserved population for a
million different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are lots of reasons to explore
the potential application of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids in these conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we did a number of survey
based studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were my first real survey based
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had done a little bit of work in this
area before, but it could have been with,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, perimenopausal, menopausal and
postmenopausal disruption and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a survey study that was a bit of an
adjacent clinical investigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals who are using a commercially
available vaginal suppository for
[SPEAKER_00]: menstrual related dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have our very first project
that's funded to look at women with
[SPEAKER_00]: endometriosis using a whole plant full
spectrum product that I made for folks
[SPEAKER_00]: with endometriosis and related pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of interest here and
people are using these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem that I often hear about is
patients will tell you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, my friend used this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'll just try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, wouldn't it be great to actually
have data that could help individuals be
[SPEAKER_00]: informed about what products they should
and maybe shouldn't be exploring?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, just the thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's, that's, I think a rather
exciting area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, endometriosis is, is one of those
conditions that so many are affected by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many are affected by the number of
symptoms is rather staggering when you
[SPEAKER_00]: really start looking at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you can improve the quality of
life and you can reduce discomfort and
[SPEAKER_00]: increase people's ability to sleep and be
less, again, either less anxious or have
[SPEAKER_00]: less pain or all of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't you try?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have a presenter last year,
uh, who talked about that and it was sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of more exploratory of, you know,
could cannabinoids potentially be a good
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it sounds like now you're actually
investigating that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's every reason to think so,
given the relationship between the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, this endogenous
system, you know, chemicals and receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the brain and body and the,
and the gynecologic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, when we think of the ways that
we're all sort of wired, why wouldn't you
[SPEAKER_00]: try to harness the most powerful things
that you could that are potentially less
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive or less disruptive to other
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, if it isn't likely to do a
ton of harm and could potentially help,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all for trying to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what we get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to be mindful of your time,
Stacey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, one of the questions I kind of
wanted to maybe, uh, kind of conclude with
[SPEAKER_02]: is, um, with all the work that you've done
from studying medical cannabis patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what lessons have you learned
that should maybe inform public policy or
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I think one of the most
important things that leaves to mind and a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of my very esteemed colleagues and
friends have published on this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, very often P people are
invested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, literally and figuratively in
buying products that are designed to help
[SPEAKER_00]: with this or that, and they spend lots of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, we know that what is on
the label isn't necessarily what's
[SPEAKER_00]: contained in the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem because the quote,
what's in your weed factor should
[SPEAKER_00]: translate to, Hey, it's supposed to be 50
makes per milliliter should have around
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for people who are on a super fixed
budget, I'm thinking of our older cohorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very large older adult study
that we did for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people scrounge and save to buy
these products that are sometimes north of
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred, $150 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wind up containing very little
active cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very little in terms of real
cannabinoids on the other side,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of what shouldn't be in there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aflatoxins, heavy metals, mold,
yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's, it's important for
people to be mindful of the, the safety
[SPEAKER_00]: and sort of the, the, the oversight that
we do need to have with some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think again, the same rules and concerns
for individuals who are vulnerable at,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say our, you have the, the,
the, the earlier age folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: exploring cannabis or cannabinoids and
were mindful of their brain and this
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental vulnerability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't appear that we have the same
quote story that gets translated over the
[SPEAKER_00]: lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So individuals who come to cannabis lane
in life, older adults who are,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just say beyond the period of
vulnerability right now on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So brains fully developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're losing things because we're
older.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't appear that there's the same
potential decrements in, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive performance that we spend
decades documenting in our recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our older medical cannabis folks sometimes
not only look stable, they look better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see structural brain changes after the
initiation of medical cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how that will shake out in terms of
public policy will be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly lots of very strongly
held opinions and thoughts about that
[SPEAKER_00]: these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That amongst other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned science, we should let
science guide the conversations though,
no?
[SPEAKER_02]: That does sound like a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not your, not your thoughts and your
feelings, what you think and how you feel,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what the actual data show us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you, and you make a good point about,
you know, the concerns of is what's on the
[SPEAKER_02]: label really in your product and,
you know, make sure there's other
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just have to think of the
conversations I've been having with folks
[SPEAKER_02]: about hemp derived cannabinoid products
and how they're not as regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they may be more available,
they may be more affordable, but there is,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a risk there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two things right in the hemp
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's little to no regulation and we
certainly should have some oversight.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, patients and consumers
should be asking for COA is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, know before you go, what are you
looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the goal of use and then ask for a
COA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what's in your wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a certificate of analysis that's quote
matched to the batch, not just any old COA
[SPEAKER_00]: that came three years ago from some
product that's made by the same company.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual product you have in your hand,
they should really have and, and more
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible and well-respected vendors
really do have that available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also tell you that, you know,
for the majority of cannabis based
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, they don't really spend most
of their time in the high CBD product
[SPEAKER_00]: arena, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's, that's not where they're,
that's not where their consumer base is
[SPEAKER_00]: headed, that people are going online for
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it would be helpful to have
people understand what to expect and how
[SPEAKER_00]: to make their best decisions really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we mentioned that you're joining
us for CanMed down in Puerto Rico and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're super excited to have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did want to ask you, are there any
certain types of professional,
[SPEAKER_02]: professionals or researchers or attendees
that you're looking forward to connecting
[SPEAKER_02]: with at CanMed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, CanMed always brings together
this rather remarkable constellation of
[SPEAKER_00]: people from different walks of life and
different aspects of this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always find it really rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to talk to our partners,
sort of clinicians and colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all share these stories and we all
agree this is such an important area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't not do it, you know, even though
it's really hard and getting harder,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we all do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly important to join forces
with what I would call the responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: industry-based folks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way that I feel about research
and clinical work.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the best of all possible worlds,
clinical work is informed by research
[SPEAKER_00]: breakthroughs, but research breakthroughs
are based on clinical needs that emerge
[SPEAKER_00]: through pure clinical work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that if you're lucky,
you have folks in industry who are
[SPEAKER_00]: invested literally and figuratively joined
forces.
[SPEAKER_00]: With responsible scientists and clinician
scientists who say, look, this is where I
[SPEAKER_00]: see something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this idea or thought maybe there's
a way to partner because very often it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really challenging to get these things
funded, to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the best ideas in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't implement them, they just sit
on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we know that the ways that these
things move forward most effectively and
[SPEAKER_00]: most quickly is usually through private
initiatives or industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily the infrastructure
that is our government partners to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how the MIND program started
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So making those connections, that's the
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Stacey, one last thing before I
let you go, I want to give you the
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to plug any website,
social media, or any other resources that
[SPEAKER_02]: you think the folks who are listening or
watching might be interested in if they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to learn more about the work that
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, we do have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's themindprogram.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just drstaceygruber.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll get you there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Twitter and Instagram, I guess it's X,
don't say Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: On X and I guess Instagram too,
it's the same, at drstaceygruber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in conversation I think with Tommy
Chong of Cheech and Chong about the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of understanding the scientific
sort of rationale behind cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a week from a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually this coming Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a holiday here in Massachusetts,
but that'll be in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you can live stream it,
but it'll be an interesting conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will share those links in the show
description and try to share the link to
[SPEAKER_02]: that discussion too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was asked, would you like to
have a conversation with Tommy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how can the answer be anything but
yes, I would, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Stacey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for the time and really
looking forward to seeing you down in
[SPEAKER_02]: Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be great to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thanks for the time.
Thank you.
