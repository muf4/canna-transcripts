[SPEAKER_02]: week, but there are still great ticket
packages available.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to see you in June.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out the details again at
canmedevents.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our guest today is Dr. Shauna Vreek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shauna is Head of Research at True
Terpenes, where she is instrumental in
[SPEAKER_02]: developing and maintaining the rigorous
safety and quality protocols the brand is
[SPEAKER_02]: known for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shauna is an active advocate for
science-based safety parameters to protect
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer health, and has worked with
policymakers to implement sensible
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations to protect public health and
maintain access to regulated cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has multiple peer-reviewed papers on
vape safety, and most recently,
[SPEAKER_02]: her work has been adopted into two ASTM
global standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: At CanMed 25, Shauna will present
toxicological risk in cannabis vapes,
[SPEAKER_02]: exogenous additives, and their
implications on consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will highlight specific higher-risk
ingredients and identify how prevalent
[SPEAKER_02]: they are in vaporization products
currently in the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_02]: During our conversation, we discussed the
main components of cannabis vape products,
[SPEAKER_02]: how and why exogenous ingredients are
added to vape products, how toxicological
[SPEAKER_02]: risks are evaluated based on hazard and
exposure level, why one can't assume that
[SPEAKER_02]: safe food ingredients are also safe for
inhalation, why risk assessment-based
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations are a better approach than
outright bans on flavors, and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to my conversation with
Shauna, I'd like to thank this episode's
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor, McKinney RSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: McKinney is made up of regulatory science
veterans who apply lessons learned in the
[SPEAKER_02]: nicotine space to help cannabis
manufacturers better understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: toxicological and societal implications of
their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do that by identifying base
compounds, extracts, flavors, and
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, understanding how they interact,
and ensuring effectiveness for the
[SPEAKER_02]: intended use.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also provide dosing recommendations
and establish guidelines for product
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn more at McKinneyRSA.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and without any further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shauna Vreek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Shauna.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited too.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I'm excited that you're
going to be joining us at CanMed 25 in
[SPEAKER_02]: June down in Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_02]: The name of your talk is going to be
Toxological Risks of Cannabis Vapes,
[SPEAKER_02]: Exogenous Additives, and Their
Implications for Consumer Safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we were saying before we started
recording here, cannabis vapes are very
[SPEAKER_02]: popular, so I think this is a very popular
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we dive into it too deep,
I wanted to just ask you off the top,
[SPEAKER_02]: what motivated you to conduct this study
on the toxicological risks of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: vapes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What really motivates me and everything I
do here at True Terpenes is always about
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer health and safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: With vape products, it's a unique product
in the cannabis space because it allows
[SPEAKER_01]: the manufacturer to add or adjust levels
of different ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be different than,
say, a flower where you can't really
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust how many cannabinoids or terpenes
or other additives that go into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have this ability to do that
with vapes, we were curious to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: types of ingredients are being used when
they're creating these vape formulations
[SPEAKER_01]: and to compare where True Terpenes stands
within the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great segue because I was
curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned different ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the main components that we find
in cannabis vapes?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do they vary?
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis vape products, there's a few
different categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the most common ones are going
to be made with a distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a distillate is like a very refined
cannabinoid extract from the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go through that refining
process, you oftentimes will lose all the
[SPEAKER_01]: volatile terpenes and other flavor
molecules that are naturally in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to kind of recreate that natural
composition of the plant, manufacturers
[SPEAKER_01]: will add terpenes and other flavorants
back into this distillate extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, those are probably the most
common types of formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also have live resin, which is
going to be a more broad spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you're going to have a live rosin,
which the live rosin is going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: most delicate way of extracting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those will oftentimes carry the natural
terpenes into the extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in regards to these like terpene
additives, there's a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that can be included.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to use the word terpene as
an umbrella term going forward just for
[SPEAKER_01]: ease of conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that also includes terpenoids,
esters, flavonoids, ketones, aldehydes,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of these really high volatile,
high aromatic compounds that are often
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can also add some other ones to
kind of increase the aroma, create new and
[SPEAKER_01]: unique flavors that cannabis consumers
really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said that it's most common for it
to start with sort of the distillate,
[SPEAKER_02]: as you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in what form is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like a powder or is it sort of
that oily, viscous material that we
[SPEAKER_02]: actually see in the vape pen?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's usually that oily, viscous
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's really refined, it can be a more
clear amber color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it's more closer to like a live
rosin material, it's going to kind of be a
[SPEAKER_01]: more like a darker amber, like a golden
kind of extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is very viscous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without any terpenes at all,
it can be very challenging to aerosolize
[SPEAKER_01]: it in a vape device because it's just so
thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the terpenes also help to liquefy it a
little bit so that it can be efficiently
[SPEAKER_01]: aerosolized in the vape pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Explain a little bit more about the
methodology behind your toxicological risk
[SPEAKER_02]: assessment that you're performing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So toxicological risk is a component of
the unique hazard risk of each ingredient
[SPEAKER_01]: coupled with the exposure level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always like to describe this in terms
of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us are all very familiar with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, ethanol, that is the
compound that has the inherent risk in
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we understand the toxicity of
ethanol, then you compare with the
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, one glass of wine,
you're probably going to feel totally
[SPEAKER_01]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll wake up the next day, feel totally
great, go about your day, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a very low exposure to ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the risk is very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then let's say, you know, after I do
my presentation, I'm really excited,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to celebrate and I drink a whole
bottle of wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a much higher exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I'm drinking that bottle of
wine, I might lose a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: balance, right, I might say things that I
think are really funny, but maybe not be
[SPEAKER_01]: so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next day, when I wake up,
I'm probably going to be very dehydrated,
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have a headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, I have a really great
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the end of the day, I feel totally
fine again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the risk between you know, a glass of
wine and a bottle of wine is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: higher because we're doing we're getting
exposed to a higher level of that ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the idea behind a risk
assessment, because nothing and I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing in this world is 100% safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to understand the
inherent risk of that individual
[SPEAKER_01]: component, but then also to understand how
much of that component, how much of that
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient can a consumer be exposed to
without having any risk or without having
[SPEAKER_01]: any like, you know, the risk is at a
negligible level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the methodologies that I employ here at
True Turpings includes surveying all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the publicly available data on each
individual ingredient, compiling all that,
[SPEAKER_01]: reading it, understanding the conclusion,
and then I perform a set of calculations,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very standard in toxicology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these calculations do things,
for example, if it was a study with a rat,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to understand what that means in a
human.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do a calculation to put it into the
levels that a human would be exposed to,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I need to put it into the exposure of
a cannabis consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand how much is a cannabis
consumer vaping every single day?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of this extract are they being
exposed to every day?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really important calculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once I get that answer from the human
exposure level, I apply a set of
[SPEAKER_01]: uncertainty factors or safety factors,
they're sometimes called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what that means is we found this
limit from a study where there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: adverse events to the rat, but we're not
100% sure if a rat is totally equivalent
[SPEAKER_01]: to a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna apply this uncertainty
factor, which brings this no effects level
[SPEAKER_01]: down, let's say 10 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's 10 times smaller limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gonna be more conservative limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can be more confident that that
limit is not gonna cause harm to our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis consumers in the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a brief overview of what
a toxicological risk assessment is and how
[SPEAKER_01]: I perform that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your example with alcohol,
you were mentioning how ethanol is sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: the compound that can cause harm,
I guess, for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're looking at cannabis vapes,
what are sort of the ingredients that are
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of of interest?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to look at every single ingredient
that's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even impurities are important to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can do this work with
cannabinoids, but there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: studies done on THC and CBD and the common
cannabinoids that are gonna be in these
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to focus on these other additives
that are in there, like the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I work at true terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we really care about are these
like terpene blends that are being added.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being added into this distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look at every single ingredient
within this terpene blend, and some
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene blends can have upwards of 40
different components in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I perform a risk assessment on each
individual component.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, no, it's great that you
mentioned terpenes, because especially in
[SPEAKER_02]: vapes and them being added back in,
they can sometimes be at unnatural levels,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be a concern or at least
something to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be at unnatural levels or they
can be at levels that are a different
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio from each other than what's found in
the natural plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before too, you were talking about as
you were analyzing sort of the exposure
[SPEAKER_02]: risk, you were taking into account how
much of a consumer typically vapes every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is that figure?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that range?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so here at True Terpenes,
we like to do a range from like 75
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams a day to 100 milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is based on a few different
studies that I've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a study in partnership with PAX when
PAX had the smart pods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they were getting real use data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we analyzed probably over a thousand
different data points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to come up with the
consumption of 95% of users.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why we choose 95% instead
of, say, the median is because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: really trying to protect most cannabis
consumers out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pick the average use, then you're
only protecting 50% of consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just felt like that wasn't really
the best use of this program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's been other studies that
have been published in peer reviewed
[SPEAKER_01]: journals that looked at consumption from
vape products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we compiled all those and that's
how we get this range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that you don't want to reveal
too much of your findings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to save that for CanVed, which I
completely understand and appreciate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you explain how or how and if you
identified some more toxic additives in
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these vapes and sort of what are
the implications there for consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: health?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we first analyzed a variety of
different terpene blends that are sold on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Internally, we have a GCMS in-house that
can do terpene analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we first ran all the products in-house
to analyze kind of the total composition
[SPEAKER_01]: of these blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what I did is narrow down our target
list of compounds to a select few that at
[SPEAKER_01]: True Terpenes, we choose not to use at all
because I think the safety profile is just
[SPEAKER_01]: not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more hazardous than it's worth using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is kind of the target list that we
started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we sent out a select of these samples
to third party labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tested them by two third party labs
to validate and verify the results that we
[SPEAKER_01]: found in-house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were analyzing products on the
market for sort of a hit list of compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: that are sort of known to be risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you mentioned that at True
Terpenes, you guys do not use those for
[SPEAKER_02]: obvious reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know you can't really
necessarily say why others do,
[SPEAKER_02]: but is it because it's a flavor enhancer
or some other reason for maybe some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these additives?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of these ingredients are really
commonly used in food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a safe history of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are approved by the FDA for human
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard that a lot generally
recognized as safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, none of those accounts for
inhaling these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I do the risk assessment,
I go beyond just oral application and I
[SPEAKER_01]: assess what would it do if we inhale these
compounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we see a higher risk
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will stress that none of these
compounds do I believe are going to affect
[SPEAKER_01]: your consumers today, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers are not dropping like flies
using these vape products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not so extreme that I'm like,
oh, shit, cannabis consumers are in like
[SPEAKER_01]: deep shit right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're looking at is 20, 30,
40 years from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to see the longevity of the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want our clients that use our
products to be able to sell these
[SPEAKER_01]: materials to consumers for as long as
consumers want to use these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, I don't think we're going
to see problem with these ingredients
[SPEAKER_01]: today or tomorrow or next year,
but over 20 years, that's where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to see these negative effects start
adding up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're really cautious about that
because like I said, we want to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry thrive for generations
to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you consider that a lot of
younger, the younger demographic is really
[SPEAKER_02]: drawn to vapes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably use it more than anyone
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: This long-term effect is even more
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on your results, do you see
regulatory bodies kind of adopting
[SPEAKER_02]: stricter guidelines or requirements for
testing for these products?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my hope is that regulatory bodies don't
start banning things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to see flavor bans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already seen that in some states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really that doesn't lead to safer
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just leads to much more restrictive
products, much more expensive products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And consumers are oftentimes going to just
travel to other states to get these
[SPEAKER_01]: products that they want, or they're going
to start buying them again from the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not want to drive consumers to the
black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my hope is that regulators will start
adopting standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've drafted and we got two ASTM
standards approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ASTM is a global standard
organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have sectors in pretty much every
single industry, including shapes of stop
[SPEAKER_01]: signs, safety glasses, even sex toys have
ASTM standards to apply to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I authored two ASTM standards around
performing a risk assessment for these
[SPEAKER_01]: exact types of ingredients that go into
cannabinoid products that will be
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my hope is that regulators will start
adopting these standards and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're going to use these exogenous
ingredients, they need to have been
[SPEAKER_01]: performed this risk assessment,
or they need to follow these two ASTM
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what can happen is regulatory
bodies can go to these manufacturers and
[SPEAKER_01]: audit their risk assessment program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of saying this ingredient is
banned, this ingredient is banned,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just say, okay, they need to comply.
[SPEAKER_01]: With these two ASTM standards,
which is how it is in many industries
[SPEAKER_01]: already today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so would that risk assessment be
performed on individual ingredients or an
[SPEAKER_02]: entire formulation or both?
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be performed on both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you perform it at the ingredient
level, it's a little bit easier because we
[SPEAKER_01]: know like true terpenes and other terpene
companies know exactly what individual
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients are in the blend since we
build it compound by compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easier to perform the risk
assessment at that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are, say, a vape manufacturer
and you are creating terpene blends
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, or you're adding terpenes
isolate by isolate as well, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: perform this risk assessment, or you can
send your extract to a lab that can do
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis on the chemical composition of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can perform the risk
assessment on the individual components
[SPEAKER_01]: that show up in the lab result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess just to clarify here too,
this risk assessment is being performed on
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients that the manufacturer or the
processor knows they are putting into the
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so much for contaminants that are
part of the processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The processing process, like residual
solvents and things like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really glad you brought it up
because we do want to clarify.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the ASTM standard, it does specify that
contaminants and impurities are not within
[SPEAKER_01]: the scope of the standard because most of
those are already regulated by the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to continue doing
those impurities, residual solvents,
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that testing by your third party lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow the action limits that are in the
regulatory agencies that you're selling
[SPEAKER_01]: the product into.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, you need to have
compliant products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, these standards are specifically
for exogenous ingredients that are being
[SPEAKER_01]: added back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can perform this risk assessment on,
for example, a live rosin product that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural extract of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always like to stress that I am not
here to police the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant creates X amount of limonene
and you have efficient extraction and so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how much limonene is in your final
product, then that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here to tell you that's too much
limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant makes it, you know,
humans have been smoking the plant for
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of years, if not more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a long safe history of use
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not worried about natural extracts
from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really focused on exogenous
ingredients that are being added back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's sort of like there's that that
base level of safety testing to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's no impurities and there's no
contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going one step further to be
like, OK, whatever we're adding in here,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's make sure that it's at levels that
are safe for consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remembered what I wanted to ask you
about, too, because you were mentioning
[SPEAKER_02]: that a lot of these ingredients are
generally regarded as safe, but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: more for ingestion and not for inhalation,
which I think that there's some carryover
[SPEAKER_02]: there with what we do here at Medicinal
Genomics where we do microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the regulations sometimes are
just lifted from food tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just wondering if there's a risk of
ingesting without taking into account the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that it is an inhaled product and
there are different risks for different
[SPEAKER_02]: microbials when those are ingested that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The risk of inhaling something is much
higher than the risk from eating it,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, because when you eat
something, it goes through the metabolism
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in your stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to change the compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes through the liver that changes the
compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time these ingredients are
actually absorbed into your bloodstream
[SPEAKER_01]: and then travel through your body,
they've been changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been altered.
[SPEAKER_01]: In toxicology, we assume that it's only 50
percent of the original ingredient is
[SPEAKER_01]: what's actually traveling through your
body versus when you inhale something,
[SPEAKER_01]: it goes from your lungs directly into your
bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no metabolism that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, there's no metabolism that
happens within the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we in toxicology assume that 100
percent of the active ingredient is being
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed throughout your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's a higher risk factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is sort of the key takeaway that
you hope that the industry professionals
[SPEAKER_02]: and regulators kind of gain from this
presentation and this work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I really just want the whole
industry to be safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to lift up all products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a big thing is like there
are ways to substitute some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients with ingredients that still
impart the same flavor but have a much
[SPEAKER_01]: higher safety profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we can't do that, if we can't
hit a flavor and make it safe,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe that's the best step
forward for the whole industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we really need coffee flavored cannabis
vapes if they're going to be potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: toxic to our consumers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I really want to push product
development teams to challenge themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: to create these flavors with safer
ingredients or you know, let's just all
[SPEAKER_01]: band together and agree not to create
certain flavors at all, because really
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer safety should be top priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be on the shoulders of
consumers to understand if their product
[SPEAKER_01]: is safe or not to make that risk versus
reward choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot for them to burden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like the industry to take on
that burden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can still innovate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, True Turpene still makes awesome,
super strong, innovative flavors,
[SPEAKER_01]: even with this program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had this program for four years
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything that's on the market today
from True Turpene is going to comply with
[SPEAKER_01]: these toxicological assessments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still think we have, you know,
the best flavors out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not going to stifle creativity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your consumers are still going to love
your products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to feel more confident
using these products for as long as they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because really, consumers clearly find
these products beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for them to be able to know questions
asked, take a product that they know is
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial and have that confidence that
it's only going to provide benefit for
[SPEAKER_01]: them, that's what I want to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and you don't have to name names or
name flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in that example that you gave,
are there certain flavors that you've sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of identified?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, we really can't make this
flavor safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, again, you don't have to say
exactly what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably say that for CanMed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But has that come up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are flavors that are really
challenging to make with ingredients that
[SPEAKER_01]: have high safety profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've done really good with,
you know, skirting around that and finding
[SPEAKER_01]: a way to make these flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if you've got the best PD
team out there, you should be confident in
[SPEAKER_01]: your product development team.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can find a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So winding down here a bit, Shauna,
we've mentioned that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: down at CanMed and we're excited to have
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any types of professionals in
general that you're looking to connect
[SPEAKER_02]: with down there so that if they're seeing
this and they know that you're looking to
[SPEAKER_02]: connect with them, they can make the trip
down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some like really fantastic
speakers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I really love CanMed,
because I think it brings in the top tier
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists in the cannabis industry with
like the most cutting edge research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one person I'm really excited to to
collaborate with is Bonnie Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked a little bit about creating
products for pediatric patients that she
[SPEAKER_01]: works with and utilizing terpenes to
create really effective blends for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the work that she does is
super fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, she is just awesome to be,
you know, providing these products to
[SPEAKER_01]: pediatric patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that sounds that sounds like a
great collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully we can make that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So winding down, I did want to give you
the opportunity to share any other
[SPEAKER_02]: resources or links that you think might be
of interest to anyone who's watching or
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to learn more about you and the
work that you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go on the True Terpenes website,
we have a few blogs that go over the
[SPEAKER_01]: toxicological program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few news articles that go over
the ASTM standards, the toxicological
[SPEAKER_01]: review.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anyone is interested in accessing
these ASTM standards, they can reach out
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to share them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, you know, I'm really hoping everyone
starts taking this work seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, let's lift up the whole
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to send me some some links to
those blogs and those resources,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to put them in the show
description so people can easily find
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll put your contact info in there,
too, if people want to get those
[SPEAKER_02]: standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they can come to CanMed and meet you in
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, CanMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's Ulrico?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you say no?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Shauna, thanks again for for
joining me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, look forward to seeing you in a
few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
