[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to thank the organizers,
which sounds very weird considering my
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship here, but it's true in that
anyone who knows me knows I'm not this
[SPEAKER_00]: organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many hats off to Doug Kennedy and the
cordage and team here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to be speaking a little bit
about decentralization and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry is going through,
because when you look at this from
[SPEAKER_00]: historical context and you look at other
industries, when this happens you do see
[SPEAKER_00]: real renaissance occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not all the way there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you've seen from many of the speakers
today, there still is centralized control
[SPEAKER_00]: over the cannabis industry and it leads to
one size fits all thinking, which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental to much of the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're halfway there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're partially decentralized with a
laboratory of democracy here where many
[SPEAKER_00]: different states and countries are
experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this experimentation is incredibly
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hopefully will eventually get to
complete permissionless innovation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will happen if it's a fully
decentralized environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think we're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we still need some tools to
accelerate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need catalysts to get us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at other industries that
have gone through this, those catalysts
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes actually require some order from
chaos, as my brother just brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take some historical examples
that are perhaps overused and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: trite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no technology presentation you can
do without talking about the printing
[SPEAKER_00]: press.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are, Gutenberg's printing
press.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really the first book that was
printed off that mattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the fact that anybody could print
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen this also with the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very vibrant debate now over
what's fake news and what's real news.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually think that's fantastic,
because now people are actually looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for references.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually have the scientific method
inside of the news agencies, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets people to think for their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very, very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing it in the financial
industries with Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a centralized banking crisis that
we have that's all over the globe right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's cryptography and
peer-to-peer networks that can do this a
[SPEAKER_00]: different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a $30 billion economy that's
booming out of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to play a role in all types
of informatics databases in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, now we are in a world where
we can sequence genomes out of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: fit in our pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually afraid to tell you about
this and fear that this whole audience
[SPEAKER_00]: would clear out of here and go look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Yvonne has just set up a DNA sequencer
out there in the hallway, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing a cannabis genome as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go have a look at that when this is
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is going to mean that you can
decentralize sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You no longer need million-dollar
laboratories with licenses to sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see people do it in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see people do it in
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to change fundamentally
how we approach science, because many more
[SPEAKER_00]: questions can be asked about the code of
life as opposed to having somebody demand
[SPEAKER_00]: to you what it is by some written book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's going to happen in the next
few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have million-dollar sequencers you may
have seen up at the tours at Cortigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're turning into these things in the
next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have PCR equipment that's probably
$20,000 to get your hands on, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: turning into USB-based PCR devices you can
see out on the tables out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this happens, much more innovation
is going to come to the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: because many more minds can access this,
and many more minds means much more
[SPEAKER_00]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make this innovation happen,
we do need a little bit of an nomenclature
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the Internet, it runs off
of TCPIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at Bitcoin, it actually has
everybody agreeing on a consensus and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody running the same code.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gutenberg probably had a font size
that mattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things help us communicate when we
want to decentralize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through a couple
examples of this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sequence things a variety of different
ways at medicinal genomics and Cortigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's whole genome sequencing where you
sequence the whole 800-megabase genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put a couple dozen of those public.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some strain-seq version one,
which we did many years ago, where we were
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing 3 million bases out of the
plant, and you get about 100,000 variants
[SPEAKER_00]: from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain-seq version two is what we're doing
mostly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 850,000 bases sequenced for that,
and that gives us a nice 10,000 variants
[SPEAKER_00]: or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put 420 of those public just this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them have been partially public
through Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got them a little bit more organized
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to touch on one that's a
little bit smaller than this, a $450,000
[SPEAKER_00]: base pair panel that we use to try and
build a Rosetta Stone for all the public
[SPEAKER_00]: data that's out there so we can look at
data in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are SNP genotyping tools
we're going to touch on as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can just genotype a couple SNPs
to really understand what's going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a phylogenetic tree now that's
up on Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually an interactive one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I have time to bounce to it
on the website here, but if you scroll
[SPEAKER_00]: around in this, these samples will light
up based on their proximity to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say proximity, I mean their genomic
proximity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a scale on there that's a
ROYGBIV scale, red, orange, yellow,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue, green, that tries to designate if
something's within a clone distance of one
[SPEAKER_00]: another, a sibling distance of one
another, or a distant cousin, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see from maps like this,
you can quickly select a set that are
[SPEAKER_00]: closely related, and we also happen to
have hundreds of these things terpene and
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype assessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can ask, do the ones that are very
genetically similar, does it predict the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of these ACDC canatonic lines,
they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see very consistent Mersene signatures
out of these, Pinene and Bisibolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also see this in a terpenaline
class of samples that are quite frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: found with the Jack Herrera class,
and these St. Jacks, and they come out
[SPEAKER_00]: with beta-carotene and terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genetics are beginning to give us a
prediction tool for which terpenes might
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be very important if you want
to understand nomenclature and labeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did run around and sequence about 15
or 20 blue dreams from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: country to figure out what is this thing,
and you'll see that lots of them actually
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster right up here in red, but there
are some over here, and some over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some over there, and we see some
people have renamed them to Snoopstream,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're absolute clones of something
else, and maybe they sell better,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that does go on, and the question is,
can you split this with something more
[SPEAKER_00]: than sequencing 450,000 bases,
because that can be expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to touch on that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's going on in this
data set, it's not yet public,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're working to move it there,
is that we are sequencing the microbiomes
[SPEAKER_00]: of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done about 400 microbiomes of the
cannabis flowers, occasionally on the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, and about 10% of those have
actually been on samples that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for this is we know the
microbes are playing a role in terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism, we know they're playing a role
in terpene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this wonderful paper that
went about using antibiotics to fumigate
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, they see the terpene
expression changes if you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: fumigate them with antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this wasn't done in cannabis,
but you can see the terpenes that are up
[SPEAKER_00]: there imply that it'll probably happen in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very similar terpenes,
Linolule, Pinene, Mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're expecting a similar thing to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't ignore the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics are, of course, predictive,
but it's the hand that you're dealt,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily how you play it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're keeping an eye on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, switching gears a little bit here,
when you have this much sequence density,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you sequence to 450,000, or 850,000
bases inside of a cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get enough markers throughout the
genome to do what's known as genome-wide
[SPEAKER_00]: association studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just simply tracking the
variants to see if they correlate with a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular trait, a quantitative trait
loci, they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do this, you start to get
some signatures coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need about 200 samples done that are
profiled with your trait, and you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps, they're all terpene profiled and
not terpene profiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do this, we're already
starting to see some signature for SNPs
[SPEAKER_00]: that might predict terpenelene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we need to expand this with more
strains, because we didn't have a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of terpenelene-rich strains in this
dataset.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's promising, because this is what
we did with the Human Genome Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this leads us to a Rosetta Stone panel
that we just recently cut, and we're a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple hundred samples deep into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is meant to triangulate all the
public data that's now public.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have many people contributing to
cannabis genomics now, which is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a dataset from Nolan Cain's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to speak about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got John Page here, who's going to
speak about all the data they've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Phylos out in Oregon who's doing a
lot of great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've put 845 samples public as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is we're all sequencing
different regions of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult to take our data
and compare it to theirs and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can't really build a
nomenclature system until we can start to
[SPEAKER_00]: triangulate these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to build a panel that would
sequence hundreds of SNPs from everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: data so that we can then triangulate any
one sample to everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're at it, we figured we ought
to sequence the genes that everyone cares
[SPEAKER_00]: about, which are these cannabinoid and
terpene genes that the Mbakel paper
[SPEAKER_00]: described back in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this panel running now,
and we're beginning to sequence these to
[SPEAKER_00]: refine some of these maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think what's going to distill from
this is the capacity to take all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs that have the most discriminatory
power and distill them into a barcode,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we want this is that these
terms indicum sativa, anyone who's done
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics will tell you they're
meaningless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are putting these on labels and
giving them to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to change this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't mind those historical terms being
thrown around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we should bring in something that has
a little bit more digital signature to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the fingerprints of these
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may also tie to the chemotype by
sequencing some of those genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we want to do is sort these SNPs
that are quite potently informative into
[SPEAKER_00]: an array that can then get distilled into
a barcode label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we ask that question,
we're beginning to zero in on around 30
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs, 29 SNPs, maybe 27.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some debate as to how many exactly
we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's looking like it's a very small
number that we can use to distill any one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those strains on that large map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the case, it changes the way
you think about the technology and how
[SPEAKER_00]: decentralized you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a list of Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're going to see up here on
vertically are every Blue Dream sample and
[SPEAKER_00]: the different SNPs they have at the
particular scaffold locations in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you can see that all those
red ones that are clones have very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: SNP patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the ones that are sitting off
in the other areas of the chart,
[SPEAKER_00]: like at 8 o'clock and 6.15 and 10.30,
they're the ones that are way out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can readily discern between clones,
siblings, and things that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: mislabeled, which is 29 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that's going to hold true
throughout the rest of the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which brings us to the second part of this
talk, which is how do we make this go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are state lines we have to
honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't move material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move DNA around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't move leaf matter around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want the grows to actually be able
to do this on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of people that helped on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I have the Henry Ford thing up
here is that this would not have happened
[SPEAKER_00]: without the help from New England Biolabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not have happened without the
help from Iken Chemical in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not have happened without Amplius
and MiniPCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one of those devices out there I
recommend people see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did play around with some Nanopores
in the process as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have one of those running on the
desk out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's use these $650 USB drives that
can do PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are now available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're no longer $20,000 They do not have
a detector head on them, which is one
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why they're very cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're light enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them up to the space station.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sending one up in the next mission
I've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may already be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get them to the TSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have any issues with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to pour it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very portable and very light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with this, it does eight wells of PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can gang up two of them into one
laptop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The assay costs are still a little bit
unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around $750.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be cheaper than anything you put
in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ambiguity here is that we don't
know the kit sizes people want yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're collecting a lot of feedback on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see why that matters
momentarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other detail here is that it works
off a hole punch, one hole punch from a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get genomic information off of
it with a very quick prep that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be showcased outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get answers in 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is much faster than shipping it in
the mail and waiting a day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more important thing that our
lawyers really addressed on this is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason we did this, and the impetus we
did this, was that we had lawyers review
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we could put leaves in the mail or
put Colleen stamped onto paper in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them said no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said you can put the DNA in the mail
and you can put the hemp stalk in the mail
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's been sterilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't put anything that's
photosynthetic onto paper and ship it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't make these rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do seem a little silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact is we would rather move the
problem to the grow than move the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: to our database, where it will become a
collection of people who have violated the
[SPEAKER_00]: CSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Privacy is, in fact, an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many people, there are cannabis
patents emerging and a lot of them speak
[SPEAKER_00]: to genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this keeps it in your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this little device can then run tests
like for the BD allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of single molecule sequencing
to figure out what snips are driving the
[SPEAKER_00]: BD allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some folks in this audience,
Adrian, who actually helped champion this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff at medicinal genomics and many
others in medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tells you whether your plant is going
to be a type two or type three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot discern between the homozygous
or heterozygous state of a functional CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: allele, but it can tell you that your
plant's got the potential to make CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: usually it's going to be a 50-50 or an
all-CBD strain if this thing turns yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it doesn't turn yellow, you are a
THC-rich strain and you'll be pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the blue dream in AK-47 you can see
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we can tell is male versus
female from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have assays that target the Y
chromosome so you can get a color change
[SPEAKER_00]: if something's male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a few other tests that we're
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to touch on them momentarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to scale this up, we're
working toward cheap ways that will get
[SPEAKER_00]: this in 96-fold format as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some hot plates from Thermo that
are around 400 bucks a piece that can get
[SPEAKER_00]: you going on this, but they don't have
automatic timers on them so you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of control those yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did bring this out to the field to
several beta trials and we're very
[SPEAKER_00]: thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think many of them are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut Pharmaceuticals, the Slater
Center, and Colorado Seeds helped us in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In every one of those sites, we learned
something and changed the primers
[SPEAKER_00]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just give you the most recent one
that occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out to Colorado Seeds very
recently and ran 47 known males and 47
[SPEAKER_00]: known females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could visually confirm they were male
and female and we were able to get 100
[SPEAKER_00]: percent accuracy off of that trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've expanded this since then and the
accuracy is probably more like 95 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: from what we're seeing when we go out to
numbers of 250 and it's very strain
[SPEAKER_00]: specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another version of trying to sex
seeds where you look at the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and some folks think that they can
determine sex from the size and the shape
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a high discordance rate with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the answer is for
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are still not mature,
but if we look at our concordance compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to what we did with knowns, we think the
seed sizing probably is still a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: coin toss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we also did this in the BD allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went and looked for the BD allele,
which is the CBD producing gene all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did many samples that Sonoma Labs
helped us capture out of the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to Colorado and looked at a hemp
farm out there and we were able to detect
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those and we also looked at the
ones in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've not seen a fail yet on CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the samples we've tested to
date with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your genome is in there,
this test likely works for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always open to scan more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's possibility that there is an
unknown marker out there we've missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this can obviously extend to other
regulatory concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go about and test any
presence-absence test that's a concern
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking about aspergillus,
if you're thinking about E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli or salmonella, a lot of the regulated
labs have to test for these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now in the process of converting
those into yes-no colorimetric assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be done both in third party labs
and done locally, which is probably how
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry should mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually the manufacturers will begin
testing before they ship to labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a grant from NIDA as well to fund
this, to try and drive some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: technology into picking up the mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to require some immuno-PCR
and there's a bit more to be spoken about
[SPEAKER_00]: that next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genomics scales very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one thing I want to touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of time for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone's been following this human
genome curve, that's Moore's Law that's
[SPEAKER_00]: looking really flat and slow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the genomics race has actually gone
way past Moore's Law in this and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to apply to what we're doing in this
space with this colorimetric assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we scale this down such that these
25-microliter wells can quickly move into
[SPEAKER_00]: 96-well plates, but we've already done
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already moved them into
10-microliter wells into 3-84-well plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see these cost curves are very
elastic and we're playing around with this
[SPEAKER_00]: system that does 15-36 wells and these
15-36 wells are 2.5-microliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not hard stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just repeating history.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this before in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can go even down to 6-nanoliter
wells if you really want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: microfluidics involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we need that because when
you think about the problem we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to address, if it's just 30 SNPs,
we just need a log scale of reduction so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can get an entire genotype of a
plant point of grow on one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine all you need is your
camera to just take a picture of this and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can hit Kenopedia and know what it is
and while you're at it, you should throw
[SPEAKER_00]: an aspergillus powdery mildew and a
handful of other markers that you might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get out of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which brings us to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not what we thought it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through the literature trying to
make assays for everything in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature that might be on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see in the literature El
Torca, P. macularis, and Golavinomyces.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought it was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made assays for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out it's a novel species that
exists on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been painstaking to get the genome
sequence of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's required a lot of special care to
make sure we don't get other endophytes
[SPEAKER_00]: and epiphytes in the process of
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing to know is that this pest,
which is probably the largest pest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis field, when it hits you,
it hits you at the worst possible time at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of your life cycle when you spend
all that time growing the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can whack out 50% of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's vascularized in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it can be there when you can't see
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the DNA picks it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided to make a hole punch
assay that would actually target this
[SPEAKER_00]: genome so that we can then see if we can
eradicate this from grows before it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we managed to scrape off some of those
spores off of the leaves and shotgun
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence those and then get ourselves a
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've only done this in New England
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a possibility that there's another
species out there out west that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, in fact, the case with wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat has two different bloom areas that
exist on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis so far, the only data we have
right now is pointing to this one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, the numbers on doing this look
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we run around with all the
collaborators we've had and look for the
[SPEAKER_00]: samples that are clean and look for the
samples that aren't clean of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get different signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clean samples stay pink and the ones
that have powdery mildew turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried a few samples that were in
question and went through and absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: mutilated the samples to see if we just
under-sampled the clean ones and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out the hyper-sampling didn't
show us a new result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, needless to say, we're still learning
how frequently we have to sample this to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick this up because it is vascularized
and we don't know if we'll get it in one
[SPEAKER_00]: hole punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the moment right now, it seems like
we are getting it with one hole punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, are we going to capture
it when it's a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to capture it at 10 weeks or
somewhere in the middle?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to work with a lot of people
in the field to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, we did begin looking at other
ways to genotype, which is using these
[SPEAKER_00]: portable sequencers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is still a work in progress,
but STRs are becoming quite popular in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field to use STRs to fingerprint some of
these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason people want to do STRs is
that they run a capillary electrophoresis
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're really cheap to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be under a dollar to run per STR,
but capillary electrophoresis is a $50,000
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument that's not field portable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to take that technology and
move it to these field portable sequencers
[SPEAKER_00]: because one day these field portable
sequencers are projecting to be as small
[SPEAKER_00]: as a little chip that goes into an iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not here yet, but if it happens,
that could be a very handy STR tool for
[SPEAKER_00]: field-based genotyping and we would want
to integrate that into the Canapedia
[SPEAKER_00]: database if we have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The preliminary data on this looks like
there is still a little bit of work to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done, but it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are STRs done out of cannabis on
nanopores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing in a lot of these
is, let me go back to that, I missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laser.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're seeing here, that there is the
STR, which is a tandem repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see the tandem repeats,
there are differences because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, in fact, the variations we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing you'll notice is a couple
of the bases have error rates and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not actually unknown or not uncommon with
these nanopore sequencers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still at about 90% accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of depth of coverage might correct a
lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say the verdict on this is
still out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned, but these are probably going
to play a role in doing pathogen detection
[SPEAKER_00]: or other types of fingerprinting in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize, I am unread, we think
under 30 SNPs can actually genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe we're going to be able to put
this point of grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out looking for funding to expand
this genotyping technology so we can build
[SPEAKER_00]: the right microfluidic chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to do this very cheaply on
site and we can hopefully include a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of other markers that would be of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that marker list is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That marker list, we have male,
female, we have CBD, we have powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew, we're looking into terpene markers
and likewise all the microbial risks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we really want to open it up to the
community as to what do you want to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for because the capacity to do genome-wide
association studies means we could do with
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 200 or 300 samples, we may be
able to find markers for powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance or drought resistance or name
your QTL or your phenotype, several
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred samples sequenced in one condition
or the other, we can hopefully distill a
[SPEAKER_00]: SNP that can make it to a point of growth
system that you'll be measuring on your
[SPEAKER_00]: phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I want to thank everyone who
made this happen, which was a very large
[SPEAKER_00]: group of people, including people outside
of cortigen and genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite a fun era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the lucky recipient to brag about it
up here, but it's really not my work,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
