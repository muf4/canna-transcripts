[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you heard, my name is Terry O'Regan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the president with Brains
Bioseudical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we're just going to continue
with what Dr. Kruber has just been talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an echo?
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an echo?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm in duplicate here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to continue the
conversation about how to continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: advance the cannabinoid scientific
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, to help me do that,
I've got a friend and a research partner,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Kishore Alagopali, who is going to
share with you some of the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing in their cancer research at
Shrin Therapeutics, and then also just how
[SPEAKER_01]: we can work together to advance the
scientific landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be on in a little while,
but put your hands together for Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kishore Alagopali.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at Shrin Therapeutics, our goal is
basically to establish, in 009,
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabidiol-based formulation as a part
of the therapeutic regimen for standard
[SPEAKER_00]: care of cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very big goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to actually put the cannabidiol
in the front-end center in the mainstream
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at here, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer statistics, 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see here is you know,
males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see something like a million people
get affected every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are new cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And females, you know, again, close to
another million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of these two million, one-third
are basically going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really very, very serious
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at all the 36 major
cancers, the top five are actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the melanoma, lung cancer,
colon cancer, and of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: gender-specific cancers such as prostate
cancer in males, and breast cancer in
[SPEAKER_00]: females, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really wanted to take these biggies
and really kind of subject to our
[SPEAKER_00]: screen-based research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you actually look at the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: cases and compare it to the rest of the
planet, what you see is the same story
[SPEAKER_00]: increased by an order of magnitude,
10 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at this, basically the
length of the landscape of various
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, you can actually see,
you know, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Europe basically take big part of this
pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what people are predicting is that by
2040, you see actually 28 million cases as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to 18 million right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means this is going to go more and
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not just one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, these millions of cases are
repeating almost forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this need to be stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we do something with this
cannabis-based medications?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the current therapies for
cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have chemotherapy, which is a
cornerstone, which kills good,
[SPEAKER_00]: bad, ugly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have radiation, and then you
have surgery, and then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: immunotherapy, and you have targeted
inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, if you understand the specific
pathway, you can go with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go with these small molecules that
can basically break the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the major problem with the
chemotherapy?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you take chemotherapy,
75% of the people with chemotherapy are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to suffer a pain called
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
[SPEAKER_00]: or chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually happens in the first one
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can see 75% of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regardless of the chemotherapy agents,
and which actually goes down by three
[SPEAKER_00]: months, you know, it can go down by 50 to
40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom line is that this is a very
important side effect one has to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is the problem with
cannabidiol here is that while this has an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing molecule, has an extraordinary
potential, it has a few limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you all know, the poor world of water
solubility, low bioavailability,
[SPEAKER_00]: suboptimal bioactivity, so that you can
actually develop a nice formulations like
[SPEAKER_00]: we have developed, and many people have
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to acknowledge the field in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a very different
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
[SPEAKER_00]: between males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically made a formulation,
which is basically a nano formulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 to 200 nanometer nanosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually use this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give oral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even these can be given injectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see in this case is that I
wanted to kind of show you the proof of
[SPEAKER_00]: principle with this formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually taken the most biologically
relevant melanoma model, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically BRAF mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 50% of the melanoma has a BRAF mutation
in the 600 amino acid position of the
[SPEAKER_00]: BRAF, the valine to glutamic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So single mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you actually can take these mouse
melanoma and actually implant it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same genetic mice, means the same genetic
makeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see actually how the
tumor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see in this red line is that
without any treatment, you have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: nice growth, as you can see on the x-axis
versus the y-axis, the tumor growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how a progression happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to treat these animals with
CBD without any formulation that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: done, you can actually delay this
progression, as you could see in the open
[SPEAKER_00]: circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you make this formulation,
it's actually much more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of the bioavailability of the
bioactivity has been significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: increased while keeping the CBD
concentration exactly at the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our colleague and collaborator
in Philadelphia, Dr. Sarah Jane Ward,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually did a wonderful study in the
SIPIN models, in the rat models,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the mouse models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where she has actually shown that you can
actually measure the pain by measuring the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical threshold of whatever the one
you are using to kind of cause the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see on the very first panel A,
you can give the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, these are treated with
oxo-platinum based chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you could see, when you treat with
more and more concentrated CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually bring this mechanical
threshold back to normal, indicating that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually decrease the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also can do the same thing in the
oxo-platinum-induced prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, you basically treat them
before so you can actually prevent them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she also has done with the Paclitaxel
and Paclitaxel prevention in both models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do in this case is that
whether you inject IV or oral,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually prevent
chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain very
[SPEAKER_00]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having shown the first part of this
particular formulation, we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesized that the formulated CBD is
going to actually work much more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently for the chemotherapy-induced
neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens if you really wanted to do
the CBD treatment in the chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_00]: context?
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it going to be compatible or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a fundamentally very important
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's precisely what we have addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually took the melanoma,
the BRAF melanoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see in this case is that no
treatment, as you could see, the black
[SPEAKER_00]: dots, you know, kind of going up with the
faster kinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you give the decarbazine,
one of the choice of chemotherapy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually decrease them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what surprised us is that the 2% CBD
containing serine formulation or 6% worked
[SPEAKER_00]: actually out completely and succeeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Significantly in statistics, you can
actually see than the actual chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_00]: occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we actually put the decarbazine
and the serine 009, what you see is really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of inhibited the tumor progression
significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in basic research, because I'm actually
a member of the Kimmel Cancer Center,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the NCA designated cancer centers
at Thomas Jefferson University,
[SPEAKER_00]: so one of the ways you can actually read
out is that look how the tumor growth is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, certain growth,
when it happens, you have to euthanize the
[SPEAKER_00]: mice because there's no point of return.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can use it as a survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how all the drugs are actually
being approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you basically do is that you
actually monitor the survival curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the black line in the panel
B is that by 35 days or 33 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the mice basically die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you treat with just the CBD,
the CBD containing serine 009,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually increase the survival by
seven to eight days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really an extraordinarily improved
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we wanted to do is that can
we do for any other cancer and it is just
[SPEAKER_00]: for the melanoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we basically did is that we picked
yet another cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lung cancer model, this is what
actually the model that made the approval
[SPEAKER_00]: of a lot of lung cancer drugs,
including the chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, the mutation is a KRAS
mutation, a classic KRAS mutation right
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream of the EGFR receptor signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in this model, what we actually
saw is that you can see the black one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, without any treatment,
kind of tumor goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have the carboplatin,
in this case, a platinum-based
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy is actually the one that is
of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the blue one is actually
kind of working pretty nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you know, even in this model,
serine 009 actually outcompeted the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy of the chemotherapy agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we put both of them, we got an
actually additive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by showing these two models,
what I'm trying to kind of convince you is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the cannabidiol-based medication is
actually compatible with the chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also one more important thing you
notice here is that if really the serine
[SPEAKER_00]: 009 is this efficacious, you can probably
decrease the actually chemotherapy doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing so, you can actually eliminate,
you know, kind of eliminate a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy-induced issues, or at least
you can minimize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is something very,
very important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we did the survival curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually again see, you know,
you have significantly improved the
[SPEAKER_00]: survival, even in the KRAS lung cancer
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went on to go for yet another
aggressive cancer model that is a colon
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colon cancer is a very aggressive model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in this aggressive model,
we have actually shown that serine has
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to kind of decrease the
progression of the tumor, and the survival
[SPEAKER_00]: is also increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly what I'm trying to kind of
show you or convince you is that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol-based medication is completely
compatible with the chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wanted to kind of look what
kind of effects the CBD-based formulation
[SPEAKER_00]: has.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, the CB2 receptor is on the
immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: By training for 30 years, I'm an
immunologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to really kind of look for
the immune-related functions because
[SPEAKER_00]: immunotherapy is actually becoming
actually mainstream for a lot of cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we basically did is that we have
treated the mice with various chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_00]: agents, as well as in 009.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see here is that each dot
represents one animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the erythrocyte count is
something like a 10 on this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the chemotherapy agents,
depending on what it is, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly decreased red cell count,
suggesting that the erythropoiesis is
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly inhibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, chemotherapy agents work very
efficiently on the cycling cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you know, the erythropoiesis is
being affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike the chemotherapy agents,
the Swin 009, two different
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, has no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also measured the hematocrit,
which did not change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also went on to look for the
lymphopoiesis, both B-lymphopoiesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: C-lymphopoiesis, because these are the
ones actually play a very important role
[SPEAKER_00]: in tumor control and tumor treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tumor surveillance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in this case, what you see is
that the lymphocyte count was altered by
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemotherapeutic agents, but not by a
terminal containing Swin 009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what happened, what I showed you
is that the cell count significantly went
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all these particular mice that are
treated with Swin are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: immunocompetent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we basically did is an immune
response to a foreign antigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we have used a foreign
antigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this antigen response is driven both
by the B cells, as well as the T cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some completely germinal-centered
driven response.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular case, as you expect,
doxorubicin, as you can see, lymphocyte
[SPEAKER_00]: counts went significantly down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quantitatively, the immune response
should go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what probably you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Swin has no effect, showing that it is
compatible with the immunotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the third thing I have actually
shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is basically pretty much my
summary, is that the Swin is compatible
[SPEAKER_00]: with chemotherapy I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to basically go after the
radiotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also work on the chronic surgical
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to kind of see whether it's
also compatible with the surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those surgeries are not painful
surgeries, otherwise, unlike other
[SPEAKER_00]: surgeries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you the immunotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also be compatible with the
targeted inhibitor, because I have shown
[SPEAKER_00]: you three different models, where the
mutations are totally different,
[SPEAKER_00]: yet the efficacy is remarkably fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our ongoing clinical studies are going
with various indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zipin is actually one of the drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are actually ready for the phase
one, phase two clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this particular thing, obviously,
we need the partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, I had a wonderful interactions
with Dr. Deborah Kimlas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to really work.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is also a Philadelphia person,
like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more important thing I wanted to
do is that I wanted to acknowledge Akhil
[SPEAKER_00]: Alagopally.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the one actually founded this
company in 2018 and recruited me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A week after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a CMO, Dr. Vijay Sandhilya.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the CMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's our in-house hematologist and
oncologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our collaborator, Dr. Sarah Jane Ward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another colleague of mine at
Jefferson, Brooke Worcester, some of you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's actually the director of the
cannabis medicine at Jefferson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's really kind of pushing this
cannabis medicine amazingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's also the new director for the
supporting medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cancer service at Thomas Jefferson
University Hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, I wanted to kind
of thank Terry O'Regan and Brains
[SPEAKER_00]: Baceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are the ones going to provide
us the APA-grade cannabidiol for the
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical studies we are going to go
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this, I wanted to kind of ask you
if you wanted to collaborate with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are more than welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are also interested in any venture
partners that want to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very excited to join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much, Kishore.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm just going to conclude this
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to talk about how we can
collaborate together to advance the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid scientific landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why that is so important to me is
because I come from the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been in pharmaceuticals for all of
my career.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I joined Brains 18 months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because so many oncologists and
neurologists and psychiatrists said,
[SPEAKER_01]: Terry, we know it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just need somebody to do the
clinical studies to tell us how it works,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it works, and how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're trying to do here at
Brains Baceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go straight on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so grateful for everybody that is
providing medical cannabis at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I come from London.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the second biggest medical
cannabis market in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I look at the statistics,
only 1% of patients are getting access to
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis from those that need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it isn't the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is making progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is where I come from a
pharmaceutical background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're saying, OK, let's play by the
rules that pharma understand, the FDA
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's try and advance this in a
different aspect to what some of you are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But together, we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, it is about giving patients
access to these treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is, with our collaboration
partners, Lakshman also, with DSM,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Fumar Nish, is we look at all the
aspects of a good clinical program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sometimes breaks my heart to see
these failed studies, because people did
[SPEAKER_01]: some guesswork, or they didn't do enough
due diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're looking at is how we can
provide this end-to-end service,
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the input material,
start right from the start, and then going
[SPEAKER_01]: into making sure that it is a commercially
viable asset that you can progress and get
[SPEAKER_01]: funding for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our partners, DSM, have our world leaders
when it comes to formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can you formulate it in a way that
is conducive to the study that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, as well as potentially
strengthening your patent?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how can you reduce the cost of
clinical programs, looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: decentralized ways of doing clinical
programs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're in the business of isolate,
because that's what the FDA understands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to know exactly what is being
combined with what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are doing an API, starting with
our CBD, but soon to have other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, where we're looking at how
we can potentially provide the best API
[SPEAKER_01]: available so that we do not compromise the
clinical studies that you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, we can guarantee
consistency, as well as being RCHQ7
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant, as well as German DAC
pharmacopeia compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you want to get into Europe,
we meet those standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just coming into a close,
we've got a reference DMF, so people doing
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also got an ASMF in Europe,
and we're looking at bringing other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: My final slide is from DSM.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, they're world leaders in
formulation, and I know that that is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a big challenge, but they're looking at
ways in which we can improve the
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailability, improve the stability,
improve the loading, and they are
[SPEAKER_01]: pioneering in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Alex, my colleague, has a poster
outside if you want to know more about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But finally, I heard Brendan's story last
night about his father, and I heard
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce's story today about his wife who had
ovarian cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I go through, I hear all the
stories as to why we got into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I can say is it's an honor for me
to step into the sector to work with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're all doing our part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it is different, but we're all
doing our part, because ultimately,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaders leave people in a better place
than when they found them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know together, you're leaving
patients in a better place than when we
[SPEAKER_01]: found them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your time.
