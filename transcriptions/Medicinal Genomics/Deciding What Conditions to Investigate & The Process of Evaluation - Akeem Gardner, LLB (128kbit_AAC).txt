[SPEAKER_00]: We do use AI and bioinformaticians to help
screen our molecules and give us
[SPEAKER_00]: information for where we think this might
be most applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we know that our
ingredients do very well is they target
[SPEAKER_00]: the inflammatory related pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that chronic inflammation,
systematic chronic inflammation is related
[SPEAKER_00]: to a wide variety of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually everything starts as that slow
burning continuous inflammation goes
[SPEAKER_00]: undetected, then it can turn into cancer,
to know degenerative problems and to
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiovascular problems, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we start is we look at,
okay, what areas of disease or what other
[SPEAKER_00]: indications are related to A,
inflammation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if inflammation isn't the primary
driver of that disease, do our molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: hit other targets that are related to that
disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in our cancer program for
glioblastoma, we found that our molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: also hit TREP-B, so that we're able to go
down that pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then really what I try to do is I try
to find a key opinion leader, someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's used to doing the academic or
preclinical or discovery work required to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to validate the ideas,
the hypothesis that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Canada, we are very fortunate to
have a wide variety of universities with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of investigators with the government
programs that can find student research so
[SPEAKER_00]: that professors with the oversight can
lead a PhD or a master's student,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even sometimes undergrad students to do
a series of experiments for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: proof of concept experiments for us,
that will give us the information we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to deductively reason and say,
yes, this is what we want to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: or this is where we think we have the
highest chance of success, or we can turn
[SPEAKER_00]: this around in a reasonable time because
from this batch of experiments and work
[SPEAKER_00]: previously done, we can fast track this
into the clinic, which we're trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with our first asset, our lead asset for
motor neurone disease, ALS.
Thank you.
Thank you.
