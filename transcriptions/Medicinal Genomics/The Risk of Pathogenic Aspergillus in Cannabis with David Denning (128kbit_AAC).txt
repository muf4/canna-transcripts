[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the CanMed Coffee Talk podcast,
where we talk with the leading minds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,
and safety testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Ben Amaralt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager at Medicinal
Genomics and proud member of the team that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts on the CanMed Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard, but aspergillus has
been in the news quite a bit as of late,
[SPEAKER_00]: and many in the industry are questioning
whether it's appropriate or necessary to
[SPEAKER_00]: test inhaled cannabis products for
pathogenic aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full disclosure, we at Medicinal Genomics
sell qPCR testing kits designed to detect
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic aspergillus on cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also published several resources
on our website that describe the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: harms that can be caused by inhaling
pathogenic aspergillus, and we cite more
[SPEAKER_00]: than two dozen aspergillus cases in
cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also recommended that states that
are considering cannabis testing
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations adopt pathogenic aspergillus
testing, not because we sell aspergillus
[SPEAKER_00]: kits, but because we want to protect
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: By almost any measure, cannabis is one of
the most safe and effective medicines
[SPEAKER_00]: available, and in many cases, the
potential harms that come from using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis are not caused by the plant,
but rather contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although cases are rare, the
documented cases describing aspergillus
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths from contaminated cannabis vastly
outnumber the published clinical risks of
[SPEAKER_00]: any other contaminant for which cannabis
industry tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no documented deaths for
cannabis-derived heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxins, pesticides, or incorrect
cannabinoid labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same cannot be said for aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is our position, but of course,
we acknowledge that we are biased and we
[SPEAKER_00]: are not experts on pathogenic fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, our guest today is Dr. David
Denning is a professor of infectious
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases and global health at the
University of Manchester.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the founding president,
executive director, and chief executive of
[SPEAKER_00]: Global Action for Fungal Infections,
an organization dedicated to reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide burden of fungal diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2016, he became the director of the
National Aspergillosis Center in
[SPEAKER_00]: Manchester, which treats patients with
chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also led the committee that
developed the first CPA guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: He chairs the editorial board of a website
which focuses on aspergillus, and he leads
[SPEAKER_00]: an organization which provides education
on fungal diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: In short, Dr. Denning is one of the
leading authorities on all things
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus, and we asked him many of the
questions that have been debated on social
[SPEAKER_00]: media recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those include, should cannabis be tested
for pathogenic aspergillus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should there be an allowable limit for
pathogenic aspergillus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is aspergillus only a concern for
immunocompromised patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the number of aspergillus cases under
reported?
[SPEAKER_00]: How difficult is aspergillus to diagnose
and treat?
[SPEAKER_00]: How ubiquitous is aspergillus in the air
we breathe?
[SPEAKER_00]: And much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to my conversation,
with Dr. Denning, I'd like to thank this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode's sponsor, Modern Canna.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Dr. David Denning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Dr. Denning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm excited to talk with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: As some of our audience may know,
aspergillus has been a bit of a hot topic
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, most notably growers in Oregon
recently petitioned the state to halt
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus testing on cannabis products,
arguing that the testing was unnecessary
[SPEAKER_00]: and negatively infecting their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We at Medicinal Genomics disagree,
but of course we also acknowledge that we
[SPEAKER_00]: may be a bit biased, which is why I
reached out to Dr. Denning to come on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and discuss the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get started, Dr. Denning,
why don't you tell the audience a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about yourself and your experience
studying aspergillus and aspergillosis?
Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my background is in clinical
infectious diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trained as a physician in the UK,
did some postgraduate training in the UK,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then spent three years at Stanford
doing further training in infectious
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases and microbiology and have been
working in Manchester for over 30 years
[SPEAKER_01]: since that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my research work and a lot of my
clinical work has been on patients with
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal diseases and my area of focus has
been on aspergillus and aspergillosis
[SPEAKER_01]: infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for about 10 years, up until about
three years ago, I led the UK's National
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspergillosis Center and we received
patients, about 300 patients a year from
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the UK with difficult,
complex aspergillus cases and disease
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is it about aspergillus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you choose to focus on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very remarkable organism,
aspergillus, because while it's present
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the world and in almost every
breath of air that you breathe in,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are certain species that cause
disease and most of them don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are also different types of
disease caused by the same organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, if you have leukemia and
you have aspergillus in your lungs or you
[SPEAKER_01]: breathe in a substantial amount of
aspergillus, then you can get what's
[SPEAKER_01]: called invasive aspergillosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is usually a fatal disease if
it's not diagnosed and treated correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's a fungus, it doesn't
respond to standard antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to use antifungal drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other patients at risk for invasive
aspergillus are patients who've had a
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant, patients with severe flu who
are on ICU, patients with severe COVID on
[SPEAKER_01]: ICU and people taking steroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any immunocompromised group of patients
really are at risk and at different levels
[SPEAKER_01]: of risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other groups of patients that get
aspergillus infections are people with
[SPEAKER_01]: severe asthma and aspergillus and a few
other fungi as well make asthma worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your symptom control is worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're more likely to get exacerbations,
more likely to end up in the ER if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't affect those with just very
mild asthma that occasionally need to use
[SPEAKER_01]: their blue inhaler once a week or once or
twice a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the patients on steroid inhalers who
have had problems with their asthma over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the group that are at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third group of patients at
risk of those with chronic chest problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: typically patients with COPD or people
with sarcoidosis or people who've had TB
[SPEAKER_01]: in the past and those with bronchiectasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole list of long-term chest
complications and those patients can get
[SPEAKER_01]: worse if they're exposed to aspergillus
and it can also cause a very chronic,
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to treat infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name for that infection is chronic
pulmonary aspergillosis or CPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what we specialized in in
Manchester, but it occurs all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just tried to do an estimate of how
many such patients there are in India.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think there's about one and a half
million people in India with this
[SPEAKER_01]: condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of uncommon, I think people
would prefer to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to summarize, you've got three
different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got invasive, which is
immunocompromised or critical care.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got chronic in these patients with
chest disease and you've got allergic,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is related to severe asthma and
occasionally cystic fibrosis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm sure it depends, but typically
how are these patients becoming exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the aspergillus in order to acquire this
infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a normal standard day, cautioning
about one's home, maybe going to work and
[SPEAKER_01]: in an ordinary office or school classroom
or retail venue, we would typically
[SPEAKER_01]: breathe in between a hundred and two
thousand scores of aspergillus every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a typical number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you have very severe immune
problems, our normal immune system will
[SPEAKER_01]: attach itself to those spores and kill
them pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get some cycling, so it takes some
time to kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not all of them are killed every day,
but they can persist for some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a concern is when you're exposed
to many, many more spores than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, if you were to dig out
your compost heap and spread the compost
[SPEAKER_01]: on the garden or you have bark chippings
that you're spreading on the garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: which have come and they're a little damp
and it's been a bit warm and damp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be exposed to many millions of
spores and those spores can set up
[SPEAKER_01]: infection for the very first time and
cause an overwhelming infection in the
[SPEAKER_01]: lungs, which can lead actually to like
pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's not diagnosed, then it
usually isn't because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you arrive in the ER or the doctor's
office in pneumonia, the assumption is
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's bacterial or it might be viral,
but rarely to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think about it being fungal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big, big spore exposure causes disease
in normal people, but particularly in
[SPEAKER_01]: people who've got chronic chest disease or
are immunocompromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are exposed to aspergillus
throughout our day, and for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: our immune system can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a scenario where you could be
exposed to a good amount of aspergillus
[SPEAKER_00]: that your immune system does clear,
but sort of in the interim, you are
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing some system, some symptoms,
whether it be a persistent cough or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, something that you might
otherwise attribute to, like you said
[SPEAKER_00]: before, a virus or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that reasonable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people will get a temporary
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a husband, wife pair who bought
a new house and before they got into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it got very, very damp and the wallpaper
that was there was mouldy and they
[SPEAKER_01]: stripped it all off in two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them ended up in hospital for
several days and and there was just fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't just aspergillus,
probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was loads of fungi, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both recovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them went on to get some long term
chronic problems in the chest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one fully recovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your scenario that you painted is is
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, it carries some risk
because of the uncertainty about making a
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnosis, treatment and actually the
labeling of the disease is actually quite
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult in that context as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's and that's a great point,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in reviewing some of the materials
that that you've produced in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: videos, that it does seem that there is a
difficulty in identifying, diagnosing and
[SPEAKER_00]: even tracking cases of aspergillosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's lots of reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is that not everybody produces
some phlegm or sputum to send to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second is the lab doesn't usually do a
fungal culture unless it's requested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungal cultures are only about 30 percent
sensitive, so they miss 70 percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we supplement that with antigen
testing, which really only works in
[SPEAKER_01]: leukemia or if you do a bronchoscopy and
in the patients with chronic disease or
[SPEAKER_01]: allergic disease, there's antibody
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do an IgG antibody or if you
have allergic disease IgE antibody and
[SPEAKER_01]: they are helpfully positive, but they're
not perfect tests because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: perfectly sensitive and perfectly
specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are difficulties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, there's imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have an X-ray or CT scan of the
chest and that can show and will show
[SPEAKER_01]: abnormalities in patients with
aspergillosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, they may not be very specific
for aspergillosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may represent other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the chronic ones look just like
TB, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this disease is often mistaken for TB.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in allergic disease, it's more an
airways infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not very much on the X-rays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more an airways infection that's
causing the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the diagnosis is tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And across the world, possibly only a
third of patients are actually diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know the precise figure
because it's a bit unknowable.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you know how many are not
diagnosed?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it probably it's somewhere between 20
and 40 percent are only diagnosed across
[SPEAKER_01]: the world of all the different types of
aspergillosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is it also difficult to sort of mine
the data that is produced from the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitals or from the health care
providers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is there a difference in how it is
sort of coded or tracked that makes things
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one part of that is that most coding
only occurs if you end up in hospital and
[SPEAKER_01]: stay a night in hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most coding doesn't occur for outpatient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a bad asthma attack, which is handled
in the doctor's office with a course of
[SPEAKER_01]: steroids and antibiotics and so on,
may not get coded at all, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one part of the gap in coding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not completely true because some of
the Kaiser units and some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: units do document everything, but many
only document inpatients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, because of the difficulty in
diagnosis, a lot of the cases don't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually hit the radar, as it were,
because they're just not they're missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then because many of these patients
have other problems as well, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have a bad COPD related to smoking
or occupational exposure and you end up in
[SPEAKER_01]: hospital with an exacerbation and you're
unwell, it will all be down to the COPD
[SPEAKER_01]: and the exacerbation and aspergillus will
be down at the bottom end of the corner if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's mentioned at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whereas that might have been and often
is the driver for that exacerbation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are lots of reasons why coding
isn't perfect and you're quite right to
[SPEAKER_01]: point it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now forgive me if this puts you a bit
on the spot, but so one of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments that the Oregon cannabis growers
have used to resist aspergillus testing is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the state was not able to produce a
case of aspergillus caused by contaminated
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, given what you know about the
difficulty of tracking, diagnosing
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus, is that necessarily a
surprise to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it reasonable to assume that there
could be unreported cases?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's reasonable to assume they're
unreported cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a surprise to me because most
doctors wouldn't report an exposure like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, because it's not the only place you
get exposure to absolutely pin it on a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint that you spoke three weeks ago or
two weeks ago or even yesterday is not
[SPEAKER_01]: always obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to the cause and effect piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can imagine writing an article
for a newspaper and trying to make that
[SPEAKER_01]: case, the editor is probably going to say,
well, we just don't believe it because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's lots of other ways you can catch
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cause and effect is difficult to
prove as well in many instances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cautions about smoking cannabis
should probably relate to people who have
[SPEAKER_01]: anything wrong with their chest or any
immune dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the majority of people probably isn't
going to affect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you smoke quite excessively large
amounts or it's incredibly moldy weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of a bit like these houses that
we, you know, if you talk about black mold
[SPEAKER_01]: in houses and all that, you know,
if it's super moldy, that's not a good
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's just a standard bit of weed
and you're completely healthy and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a joint or two joints or something,
probably that risk is pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not zero, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because there was nothing in life
that's zero risk, but it's a low risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are a lot of people out
there who've got cancer semi cured,
[SPEAKER_01]: but their immune systems are not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got bad chest asthma, very common in many,
many groups and people with undiagnosed
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some genetic disorders which
lead to aspergillosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the first cases reported linked
cannabis was unveiled that that genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: This young lad wasn't able to fight off
aspergillus, smoked a joint and ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a new diagnosis of a genetic disorder
showing that he couldn't handle
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are risks even in apparently
normal people, although they're small.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I, as I point out, probably the big
deal here is two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is it's the fumigatus,
aspergillus fumigatus is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogenic of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other species of aspergillus are less
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavus is somewhat important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Niger is somewhat important, possibly
terrius, but there's about 300 other
[SPEAKER_01]: species out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're very, very, very rarely cause
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's fumigatus is the big driver for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, if you're looking at a
cigarette or a bit of weed or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to know whether what the
species of fungus on there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so knowing that is probably is
helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second is the is the amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and many people smoke without a filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get the spores may be drawn in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the end of the cigarette is hot where
you've lit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rest of the cigarette is not so
hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the spores of aspergillus fumigatus is
incredibly heat resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can survive up to 70 degrees C and
and grows up to about 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it isn't going to be healed by the
passage of hot smoke coming down the
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there are spores in the rest of the
cigarette, then those will get inhaled.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's about quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if in that cigarette, there's 10 spores
or 500 spores of aspergillus, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably not going to be very serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's 10,000 spores or 100,000
spores, and there might easily be if that
[SPEAKER_01]: mold is if the if the marijuana is wet or
damp, then that's a big that's a big dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you only take one, if you share a
joint with somebody and you only take one
[SPEAKER_01]: breath in with it, that's going to be
lower risk than if you you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you make a big, big joint and you have
three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so there's a quantity effect here as
well as so the species is a quantity and
[SPEAKER_01]: and the quality of the actual mold of the
of the of the weed that's being smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's that's actually a very
interesting point, because the regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: in Oregon and in a lot of states as well,
the limit is one CFU per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, what they're looking for
is that one gram of the cannabis batch
[SPEAKER_00]: should be completely devoid of any
pathogenic aspergillus, the ones you named
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavus fumigatus terius niger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that in mind, is that in is that
an overly conservative amount?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should there be a higher allowable limit
in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think that is too stringent.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this problem, because I don't know how
much a joint weighs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if it's 60 grams or 50
grams or something like that, that's only
[SPEAKER_01]: five, you know, 50 spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very low number of spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it would be OK to do two
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is to raise that limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it's 20 spores per gram or 10
spores per gram somewhere in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quite a lot higher than one gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, to put a warning on about
not smoking, if you have any
[SPEAKER_01]: immunocompromising effects, if you have
asthma or you have chest disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if if those two things probably would
mean that the the number of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: would get ill from aspergillus would be
very, very, very small indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to quickly come back to the
issue of immunocompromised, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think, you know, we had talked about
cancer patients and folks with sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are certainly immunocompromised,
but there is some literature talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, even if you have influenza
or perhaps Covid-19, you could be,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote unquote, immunocompromised and
therefore maybe more susceptible to an
[SPEAKER_00]: infection from aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two viruses and there's another
one in Korea and China, which greatly
[SPEAKER_01]: increased the risk of getting life
threatening invasive aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the Covid outbreak, this was really
well demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that if you ended up in intensive care
with your Covid, you were very breathless
[SPEAKER_01]: on oxygen, possibly the tube down the if
you had aspergillus as well and somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: between five and 20 percent of people got
aspergillus as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is quite a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your risk of surviving was halved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspergillus doubles your risk of dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's true for influenza as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a slight difference between them
because the risk of getting aspergillus
[SPEAKER_01]: with influenza is as you go into ICU,
it seems to be very, very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so influenza is definitely altering
the the way that the body responds to the
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just can't get rid of it if you
have influenza.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be another warning on the
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a viral infection,
do not smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a very helpful piece that
could be added with Covid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be a bit later in ICU.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people who get it tend to be have been
in ICU for a week or so before they get
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably partly because they're
given steroids as part of the treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: for Covid and which is helpful for the
Covid, but unhelpful for aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So aspergillus corticosteroids knock out
the immune system so you can't respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they make aspergillus grow faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a double whammy steroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and so so those you're quite right to
point those those things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as if there's a bit of technical
background, a very careful study was done
[SPEAKER_01]: in seven intensive care units in Belgium
and Holland over about five years during
[SPEAKER_01]: flu seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the background rate of aspergillus in
their normal ICU patients coming through
[SPEAKER_01]: the door was one in twenty five percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was quite a high rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you had influenza, it went up to 19
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a four times higher rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, as I say, doubled the mortality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So influenza and aspergillus are not a
good mix at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing, too, in talking about
the risk of aspergillus has it results to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, there's the users, right,
who are actually using the product,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then also the farmers as well is
something that has come up or the trimmers
[SPEAKER_00]: or the folks who are sort of processing
the actual plants risk for them as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing that, that they could be
inhaling sort of these large amounts of of
[SPEAKER_00]: spores if it's not properly dried and
processed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a definite risk that there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know from other occupations that
multiple fungal exposures do lead to lung
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually people who are doing that are
fairly healthy before they start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not everybody would get sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just don't even seem to notice
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get really fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it isn't a risk for everybody,
but it is a risk for some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think there are a couple of ways
of handling that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is ensuring that the plants
are dried as quickly as possible so that
[SPEAKER_01]: there isn't very much dampness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there is a flood or this damp gets
into the bales and it's a damp thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: they should probably just all be discarded
because there will be masses of
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second thing is that you can wear
masks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are N3 masks which prevent infection
with TB and other things, and they would
[SPEAKER_01]: also mostly prevent infection with
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is wearing a mask for hours on
end is pretty uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people end up, you know,
because they get all sweaty behind them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they end up moving it around
their face because it's uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it doesn't work perfectly,
I think it's fair to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with dry plants, the risk is much
lower than it is with damp plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess more broadly here, what do you
see as the major rising risk factor for
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this might be in general not
necessarily related to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what do you see as the major rising
risk factor for aspergillus that
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers should be examining?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the area that's underdeveloped in
research terms and clinical terms is the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients with COPD who typically are
between 50 and 75 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've usually been smokers, but not
always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're pretty breathless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the standard of care for those
patients is when you get an exacerbation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're much more breathless, possibly
related to a virus or a bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: infection or a chemical exposure in some
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're given steroids, and those steroids
probably increase the risk of aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did an estimation two, three years
ago now, how many people probably have
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus in the context of COPD,
and it's in the millions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of people across the world,
a particularly large group in China,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a lot of smoking in China.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's true in other parts of the world
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure it's true in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's quite a difficult diagnosis,
and it's not always picked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if patients aren't better,
then you give more steroid, and that's bad
[SPEAKER_01]: for this entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's one area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing that we're going
to see is patients with many complex
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we get older, we collect diseases in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the patients at risk in
their 60-plus who have diabetes,
[SPEAKER_01]: who are on a bit of steroid, who have a
bit of a bad chest, a bit of heart
[SPEAKER_01]: failure, a bit of this, a bit of that,
those patients start to become at risk as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they end up in intensive care,
then that's the group, the 5% group that
[SPEAKER_01]: get disease in intensive care,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's interesting too,
I guess, in the context of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the over 65 demographic is the
fastest growing user base for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe something to consider there.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I do want to circle back to
what we were saying about the farmers and
[SPEAKER_00]: repeated exposure to the function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that also possibly apply to users?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if they are continually using a
product that is contaminated with sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: lower levels than we were discussing
earlier, could sort of that accumulate
[SPEAKER_00]: over time and be a concern?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does depend how often it's used and how
much aspergillus is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other, there are other things of
course, in cannabis cigarettes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not just aspergillus, there's
cannabinoids and other things and they may
[SPEAKER_01]: have an effect on the lungs as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that for tar and tobacco is an
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is that many people
smoke cannabis without a filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them means more of that crud ends
up in your lungs compared with a filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being filtered out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also means that the smoke is much
hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did see one man who smoked like 20
joints a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he was really, you know,
he was, you know, and he basically
[SPEAKER_01]: destroyed his lungs and he had aspergillus
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But probably it was the heat of the
cigarette, of the joint that actually did
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Difficult to prove, you know, how do you
prove that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I suspect that there are other
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it isn't just aspergillus that can
damage lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's these other things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the damaged lung is going to be a
more, the damaged lung is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: more suitable or a better habitat for the
aspergillus to sort of take hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may be a self-perpetuating circle in
a negative way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess, so winding down here,
is there one thing that you wish sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public understood about
aspergillus and aspergillosis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this doesn't have to necessarily
even apply directly to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think patients who have bad chests,
whether it's because of asthma,
[SPEAKER_01]: super D or some other chest disease,
when they get ill, they should ask the
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor and probably every doctor they see,
is it a fungus in my lungs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's very easy for doctors to not
think about it, to not remember about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're reminded, then there are
special tests that they can order and they
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually get to the diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and often it's thought about by
senior, very experienced doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think about it, but you don't always
see one of those doctors when you first
[SPEAKER_01]: arrive at ER or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a family doctor, aspergillus is a
very rare disease, apparently,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they wouldn't make a diagnosis in
family practice probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they won't think about it very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's being aware of it and
alerting doctors to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got any chest problems,
particularly ongoing chronic chest
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sorry, this is going to be a bit out
of context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, or out of order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might have to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And edit this, but we did get a question
from someone that I wanted to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that I asked you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis farmers have expressed concern
over the use of fungicides to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could possibly be the impact of using
fungicide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could the impact of fungicide use be
for azole resistant aspergillosis and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis processing or farmers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And could it possibly be a cannabis
farmer's lung in our future?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the issue of spraying crops with
fungicide is a very important issue
[SPEAKER_01]: because there is a bystander effect of
emergence of resistance to azoles in
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the aspergillus fumigatus isn't really
a crop pathogen, but it lives in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's warm and moist and there's
degraded plant material, it will grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you spray the crops and something
like a third of all fungicides used are
[SPEAKER_01]: azoles around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number of azoles being used in the
US in crops has gone up and up and up in
[SPEAKER_01]: recent years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens then is you get the
emergence of azole resistance in
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus fumigatus, and then people
breathe in azole resistant aspergillus,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they don't respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: They respond to the normal and the best
therapies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best treatments for aspergillus are
all azoles, and the only oral treatments
[SPEAKER_01]: are azoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a resistant bug,
then you may have to have IV therapy and
[SPEAKER_01]: have it for long periods of time,
which is very uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current rate of azole resistance in
the US in where it's been measured is
[SPEAKER_01]: around 3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe, it's around between 15 and 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Southeast Asia, it's between 80 and
95%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are going to see probably the loss
of azoles as treatment for aspergillus if
[SPEAKER_01]: we continue to spray the crops with large
amounts of azole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have that option as a
treatment, what do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have intravenous drugs, which are less
effective and obviously need catheters and
[SPEAKER_01]: nurses to administer and much more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is much more toxic as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a big deal losing azoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of the issues we had in our
national center because patients would
[SPEAKER_01]: develop azole resistance on azole therapy
because we gave it for such a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: because they had such difficult disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got really stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't really treat them properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are new drugs in development,
but they haven't arrived yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably about between one and
three years away in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are there better fungicide treatments
that don't use azoles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there are lots of different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's around 20 that are used,
and they're often used in mixtures and
[SPEAKER_01]: sequential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have mixture A and then mixture B
and then mixture C, and they're sprayed at
[SPEAKER_01]: 10-day intervals at certain points.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends very much on the crop and how
it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, there are about a third of the
fungicides that are used in agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: are azoles and two-thirds are not azoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The term that's used, of course,
in colloquial language is pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's actually fungi cause 90% of plant
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually fungicides are the
biggest issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got some weeds,
so there's herbicides, and the pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: are for the mosquitoes and other insects
that eat the crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fungicides are the major thing that is
sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Dr. Denning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winding down here, I did want to give you
an opportunity to mention any other
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that might be of interest to the
watchers and listeners here if they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn more about this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I want to give you an
opportunity to plug any websites or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else that you would like to share
with the audience so that they can get in
[SPEAKER_00]: touch with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do run a website called the
Aspergillus website, which is aspergillus
[SPEAKER_01]: .org.uk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's loads and loads of materials
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including a short section on cannabis and
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also run an educational website
primarily for health care professionals
[SPEAKER_01]: called fungaleducation.org, which is in
English and in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's got a lot of videos about the
diseases and diagnostic tests and small
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers on radiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody on antifungal therapy on both
of those websites, there's a link to drug
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the problems with Azoles and
many other drugs is that they interfere
[SPEAKER_01]: with other drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole section for patients and
the public, as well as health care
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals on drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those may be helpful for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put those in the show description
so people can check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we covered a lot of ground here
today, and it seems like we've arrived to
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat of a conclusion that there is a
risk for cannabis users, maybe certain
[SPEAKER_00]: ones in certain situations, fair to say,
and that testing is probably prudent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe we need to rethink the limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I know manufacturers don't
like to put warnings on cigarettes and
[SPEAKER_01]: their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think a general information about
patients at risk would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, Dr. Denning, thank you so
much for the time and good luck with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
