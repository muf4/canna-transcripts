[SPEAKER_02]: I got my PhD in 1995.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked on a wide range of plant viral
diseases, and I've met folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined, let's see, I joined Texas A&M
about five years ago, and I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: working on a wide range of problems,
and I got involved with Hoplate and Viroid
[SPEAKER_02]: when I met folks from Rare Earth Genomics
and started working with Russ Jessup,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's a breeder at Texas A&M, to try to
tackle some of these questions and issues,
[SPEAKER_02]: and while I could say I'm an expert at
plant virology, I'm also feeling like I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: an expert at something in Hoplate and
Viroid we know very little about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited to be here, and I'm excited
to take on this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've developed an infectious clone of
Hoplate and Viroid, and this is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: my starting talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am in the plant pathology department at
Texas A&M, and this is an example of some
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that we infected in our growth
chamber, and one of the biggest questions
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have is you can look at these
plants, and the same variety has different
[SPEAKER_02]: disease patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we explain the disease?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we conquer the disease?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we recognize the disease?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one healthy plant here in the
corner, and you can see very severely
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorotic plants and mildly chlorotic
plants, and they were all inoculated at
[SPEAKER_02]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this creates a challenge in itself
for working with growers, trying to help
[SPEAKER_02]: them identify healthy from infected
materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to start by telling you a
little bit more about the life cycle of
[SPEAKER_02]: Viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very easy for non-virologists to
think a Viroid and a virus are the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the same life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really are quite different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Viroids are small circular RNA molecules
that don't encode for any protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're only 250 nucleotides in length,
which is crazy small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work on RNA viruses that are 10,000 base
pairs in length.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 250 is about as small of an infectious
agent as you can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they don't encode any proteins,
they are kind of a miracle, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: because how do they cause such an amazing
disease and cause so much changes to a
[SPEAKER_02]: cell and to a plant without really
encoding anything at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoplate and Viroid is a circular RNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is its replication cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It encodes a single strand nucleic acid,
and it replicates in the plant's cell
[SPEAKER_02]: nucleus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it depends upon the host machinery in
order to replicate and cause infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the host RNA polymerase acts on the
genome and produces a copy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that copy then serves as a template
for production of multiple strands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each of those are produced and
circularized, and it continues through a
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle of synthesis and replication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's able to spread throughout the
plant, so that means it must exit the
[SPEAKER_02]: nucleus, move through plasma dismata
between cells, enter the vascular system,
[SPEAKER_02]: and somehow wreak havoc on these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoplate and Viroid causes DUD disease,
in case you don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's interesting for me as a plant
virologist to try to understand how a 250
[SPEAKER_02]: nucleotide amino acid can cause a latent
infection where you don't see any symptoms
[SPEAKER_02]: for a while, and then suddenly destroy the
flowering ability and affect its complete
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Viroids, many Viroids, not just
Hoplate and Viroid, are latent viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are latent diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite common amongst the Viroid
pathogens that they cause latent
[SPEAKER_02]: infections, and then you don't see them
until much later.
[SPEAKER_02]: One example is peach-latent Viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's huge problems of Viroids in stone
fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peach is one example, and you don't see
disease until the plants start,
[SPEAKER_02]: or until the trees start to wither.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because of their issues in stone
fruits, as well as in hops and in hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are an economically very important
category of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you know, Hoplate and Viroid causes
extremely important, significant problems
[SPEAKER_02]: in the hemp industry, which is how we got
involved in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as we got involved about a year and
a half, two years ago, working on Hoplate
[SPEAKER_02]: and Viroid, we started developing the
tools to detect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our first most important questions
was early detection of Hoplate and Viroid
[SPEAKER_02]: in infected plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you know if you, and the main
approach is to use a PCR technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're very concerned about quality
control in our research and in our
[SPEAKER_02]: efforts, and making sure that we get true
positive results, not false positive
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: True negative results, not false negative
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're dealing with a plant with
such an array of no symptoms to severe
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorosis and death, how do you know that
you might have missed a positive outcome?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of our PCR technologies has
allowed us to identify the genome,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is 256 nucleotides, as well as
replicating intermediates, which can be
[SPEAKER_02]: 500 to 750, up to 1,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: This Viroid, as it replicates,
produces multimers of itself, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they cleave into mature products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been able to detect the
replicating units, both as monomers,
[SPEAKER_02]: dimers, and trimmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through this technology, we've also
developed infectious clones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves monomers, dimers, and trimmers,
and are using that to inoculate plants so
[SPEAKER_02]: we can begin to study uniformity of
inoculation, uniformity of infection,
[SPEAKER_02]: and start to provide real workflows for
how to identify the problem, how to solve
[SPEAKER_02]: the problems, how to make sure your mother
plants are clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our major goal right now is to
understand, some of the things we're
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in is understanding non-host
resistance as a guidance for design and
[SPEAKER_02]: Viroid-resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at screening germ plasms to
identify germ plasms that may not be
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible to hoplite and Viroid that
would be non-host and compare them and
[SPEAKER_02]: perform crosses with very susceptible
plants and see if we can understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic basis of resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're wanting to understand what happens
in the host during latency that's
[SPEAKER_02]: different from what happens to the host
during severe symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the Viroid doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just dormant, not doing anything,
or is it doing something metabolically
[SPEAKER_02]: that the host actually is having an immune
response?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe after latency, that immune response
is failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to understand what is the host
response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how immunity functions against Viroid
diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'd like to engineer Viroid
resistance using a range of novel
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these questions that we're asking,
they're also asking in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_02]: other Viroid diseases globally.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problems that we're facing in hemp
with hoplite and Viroid are the same
[SPEAKER_02]: problems they're facing in stone fruits
like apricot, plums, peaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I also wanted to, to start my
talk was differentiate hoplite and Viroid
[SPEAKER_02]: from hopstunt Viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found in talking with folks that it's
very easy to mix the two up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are actually two different species of
Viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both infect hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both seem to cause a stunting when
they cause disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopstunt Viroid is a different
organism together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopstunt Viroid infects hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It infects grapevines.
[SPEAKER_02]: It infects citrus, cucumbers, and a range
of stone fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoplite and Viroid, which is a huge
problem for the hemp industry and the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry, does not infect those
hosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a sample when we began this work of
over 111 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that 80% of those were
infected with hoplite and Viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found no evidence of hopstunt
Viroid co-infecting these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're clearly looking at a single
infection problem, not a potential for
[SPEAKER_02]: mixture of the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to throw in some pictures
of folks that are working with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, pictures of our friends at Rare
Earth Genomics that are helping to support
[SPEAKER_02]: this research.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the scientists in my
program who is speaking with our
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are some of the experiments that
he's been running.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been interested in looking at
developing sensitive detectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at different infection
methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to perform assessments of Viroid
host interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking right now at different
hoplite and Viroid variants and comparing
[SPEAKER_02]: the different variants across different
plant genotypes and trying to track the
[SPEAKER_02]: progression of the disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Major fundamental question, are there
different strains of hoplite and Viroid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a severe strain and a mild
strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to tease all those
questions apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also requires understanding the
different genotypes of the hosts that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here's an example of some of our
experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps there's different variants between
the two different hosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how we're going about solving that
is using an infectious clone technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we take sap from an infected plant
that we get from a grower, we don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: if that infected material that we get from
him has a mixture of variants or is a
[SPEAKER_02]: single variant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a single strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using our infectious clone technology,
we can make one single strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: one single variant, and introduce that
into a variety of different genotypes and
[SPEAKER_02]: start to characterize the nature of the
symptoms, the nature of the disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can start adding new layers of
different variants and making comparisons
[SPEAKER_02]: between them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is some fundamental work that
we're performing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we are examining and working
with 71 different isolates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found 41 different mutations across the
populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are now looking at how these
different mutations influence symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is one of our exciting new PCR
diagnostics that we developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've developed some PCR primers that
overlap a highly conserved region of the
[SPEAKER_02]: viral genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's extremely sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take an asymptomatic leaf that we
know we infected the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it's infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not producing any symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been able to develop a
diagnostic PCR that can detect 10 to the
[SPEAKER_02]: minus ninth molecules of infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're moving forward with our
diagnostic analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've compared using infectious sap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've also used our infectious clone
that we've generated in our laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to understand if you use sap
from an infected plant that we've taken
[SPEAKER_02]: from the field, is our infectious clone
technology as sensitive, as robust of an
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculum as taking sap from an infected
plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, when we're looking at
inoculated plants at 26 days, 39 days,
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 days, and then when we use our own
in-house infection system at 21 and at 42
[SPEAKER_02]: days, we see 100% of our plants are
infected systemically and 100% of our
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are infected locally, whereas the
infectious sap is a little slower at
[SPEAKER_02]: producing infection in some hosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're comfortable with our
technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're able to move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a study that we performed using
different hosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to understand how many different
plant species are infected with hoplite
[SPEAKER_02]: and viroid that are not reported in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, very few people are working on
this problem at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've traveled through Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone I know in Europe is working on
hop stunt viroid, which is a huge problem
[SPEAKER_02]: in the hops industry there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have yet to meet an academic that's
working on hoplite and viroid full time as
[SPEAKER_02]: their problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, Europe is restricting the
ability to do this type of work,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as many states in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really happy that in Texas we're
able to do our studies on hoplite and
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found it infects cucumber.
[SPEAKER_02]: It infects tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it causes some pretty severe death of
chrysanthemum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are a vegetable gardener as well
as a grower, you may want to be aware of
[SPEAKER_02]: your vegetables as being a reservoir,
or your chrysanthemum plants in your
[SPEAKER_02]: flower garden as being a reservoir for
disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example of our PCR diagnostics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see what kind of results we get
when we look at our different plant hosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get very clean, very robust PCR
products across our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that are negative are healthy here,
just to show you how our data looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found in our studies that Arabidopsis
plants, which is a model genetic system,
[SPEAKER_02]: Arabidopsis was one of the first major
plant genomes to be sequenced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a model like Drosophila is a
model for human genetics, mammalian
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, C.
[SPEAKER_02]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arabidopsis is our plant model genetic
system that's used globally for dissecting
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found it's highly susceptible to
hoplite and viroid, which is exciting
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's the only viroid that is known
to infect Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also infects cucumber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that those plants die at
maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is an example of Arabidopsis
plants that we have grown in pots and the
[SPEAKER_02]: infected hoplite and viroid infected
plants, once they reach maturity,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's called a decline or a dieback
disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants don't die until they reach
maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you see the necrosis,
the death, the browning tissue just going
[SPEAKER_02]: backwards down towards the base of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a novel symptom and it's a way we can
characterize and start using Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics to study decline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's an example of younger plants
that we infected with hoplite and viroid
[SPEAKER_02]: using different versions of the infectious
clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with a higher level of inoculum,
we can see earlier decline of the tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a healthy infected, healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of these declined quite
rapidly before they could produce flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, here's our mock and here's our
mutant version of hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not supposed to produce a dieback.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, the mutation
eliminated the dieback phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're excited to now have good
diagnostic tools, a good infectious clone
[SPEAKER_02]: technology, and a good genetics that we
can begin to look for host-non-host
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance and understand host immunity
responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we move forward, one of the major
questions that we wanted to start looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at is developing a workflow for how to
sample, how to perform diagnostics in
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have a latent viroid,
where do you sample?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get a negative result, did you
sample the right tissue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you have to keep sampling?
[SPEAKER_02]: How often do you have to keep sampling to
make sure that your mother plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy and remain healthy?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our approach has been to develop a
strict inoculation technique where we
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculate a specific leaf on the plant and
then we start sampling all the way up the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to identify where does the virus
move first?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you inoculate one leaf three weeks
later, where is the viroid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Four weeks later, where is the viroid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Six weeks later, where is the viroid?
[SPEAKER_02]: And can we track its movement up the
plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it doing something unexpected?
[SPEAKER_02]: As you may know, the literature has shown
that this viroid tends to move to the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots first and then moves further up the
plant next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the best sampling results can often
occur by testing roots early and then
[SPEAKER_02]: testing the tops of the plants later.
[SPEAKER_02]: With our new sensitive PCR technology,
we've been working at verifying that
[SPEAKER_02]: pathway for virus infection in plants and
continuing our PCR testing to streamline a
[SPEAKER_02]: protocol in a way that we're not damaging
the plants, but we can reduce the amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of times you have to sample and test.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, we're trying to
understand the kinds of symptoms we can
[SPEAKER_02]: see with different variants of the
viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can be the experts at telling you
how to manage disease in your crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on our new knowledge of the dieback
symptoms that we see with hoplite and
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid in Arabidopsis, we wanted to ask,
can we see similar phenotypes happening in
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, yeah, hemp is what we're working on in
Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we were excited recently,
this here is an example of Brandywine
[SPEAKER_02]: variety or cherry wine variety,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that the leaves are
starting to die off on the plant and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: looking pretty sick at maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, how do you know if your
plant's just senescent naturally or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a nutritional issue and it's
dieback or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting to feel more and more
comfortable that when we inoculate a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, we switched over to using another
variety called Puma 3.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this variety, you see extreme yellowing
of leaves within two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can inoculate a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two weeks later, we see this extreme
yellowing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is what the top of the plant
looks like in other examples where you get
[SPEAKER_02]: this crazy mosaic pattern on the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by controlled inoculations and
testing different varieties, we can then
[SPEAKER_02]: start reporting what you should see when
certain varieties are infected with
[SPEAKER_02]: certain variants of the viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's exciting for us that with Puma 3,
we get this yellowing and this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: progresses to yellow every week until it
just completely turns dead, completely
[SPEAKER_02]: dies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is work that's being done by
another student in our lab, Sydney Abbott,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's been managing our propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's quite excited to see this is an
example of Puma 3.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just continuing to yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the uninfected, healthy version of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the severe differences between
infected and healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the only time I've seen a grower
who's excited that she's gotten an
[SPEAKER_02]: infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: At first, she was scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, oh, my plants don't look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, this looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we want to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're proud of the direction that this
work is going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we can say right now is we believe
that we have that hoplite and viroid
[SPEAKER_02]: causes a dieback disease, that the
yellowing and the phenotypes that we see
[SPEAKER_02]: is an example of the symptoms that you can
see early.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting to work at developing
technologies that maybe can pick up on the
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid before you see that extreme dieback
and maybe ways of managing the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're comfortable with saying this dieback
disease is what the disease should look
[SPEAKER_02]: like based on studies, for instance,
with peach-latent mosaic viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example of infected
peach-latent, where the plants look great
[SPEAKER_02]: until they don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the plants look like they
don't have very much leaves on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example of infected peaches
versus healthy peaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how do you know that you have
infected peaches until you started your
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar problems to what we're having
in the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the viroid problems that we're having
here in the hemp industry aren't unique
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two just hemp, but these are global issues
that we as a community within the viroid
[SPEAKER_02]: community can start discussing amongst
each other, and I can pull polls from some
[SPEAKER_02]: of my colleagues working on other crops
and work towards common solutions and
[SPEAKER_02]: build on their knowledge to help find
solutions for this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really excited to be moving in
this direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the differences in the healthy
and infected stone fruits, healthy and
[SPEAKER_02]: infected leaves, flowers change colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these are symptoms, but they're not
obvious symptoms to a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might be anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we're moving forward, this is an
example that I wanted to pull also from
[SPEAKER_02]: peach-latent viroid to show you how you've
got this 250 nucleotide size pathogen in a
[SPEAKER_02]: single variant, which means a change in a
couple of nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can completely change the symptoms that
you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this example, this is a diagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a diagram of what the peach-latent
viroid looks like when it's folded into
[SPEAKER_02]: its mature state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this shows here in panel B is
these four nucleotides are changed here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look at the difference in the
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an asymptomatic disease,
and this is a complete clorotic disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on that knowledge, we started
looking at a number of informative
[SPEAKER_02]: mutations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I've mentioned, we have a total of
41 mutations in our current population of
[SPEAKER_02]: hoplatent viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been performing some bioinformatic
analysis to understand which are probably
[SPEAKER_02]: the most informative and useful mutations
to go after to study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are starting now to look at the
effects of different mutations on dieback.
[SPEAKER_02]: And chlorosis in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully this time next year we'll
have some updated information for you on
[SPEAKER_02]: what types of symptoms that we see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to end my talk the same way
that we began with a thank you to Rare
[SPEAKER_02]: Earth Genomics for their contributions,
support, funding for this research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without them we would not be even
beginning to explore this very important
[SPEAKER_02]: problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again to our colleagues at Texas A&M
who have been working in the breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: programs and development of improved
genetics along with Rare Earth Genomics
[SPEAKER_02]: and Texas A&M University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the viroid transmitted in nature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Transmission of the viroid in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: This viroid, we don't even know if there's
an insect vector, what the insect vector
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really very little work done on
this problem, which is shocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also for me, quite exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can make some headway on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do know that it's extremely infectious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get one infected plant, it spreads
through everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me that's not much different from
tobacco mosaic virus where the dew in or
[SPEAKER_02]: the humidity in a greenhouse can be enough
to spread it through the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you get it on your hands and you can
transmit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would advise if you have an infected
plant you be wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And change gloves between individual
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And take your cutting tools and your
pruning tools, bleach them in between
[SPEAKER_02]: plants so that you don't transmit them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We recommend different virus sites for
treating bench tops and the like to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: everything under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that picture on the left and at least
one other one that you showed the control
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that was not inoculated was the
smallest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that by chance or have these all been
inoculated at the same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are the different variants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we see in our gardens is that
the infected ones are the smallest ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were not totally propagated.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were grown from seed and so there's
some heterogeneity in the seeds.
Have
[SPEAKER_06]: you already investigated some mutants in
our autopsies such as replication factors
[SPEAKER_06]: or smaller RNA molecules transportation
within the plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you already used these mutants to
address either the replication mechanism
[SPEAKER_06]: or the transport of the molecules within
the plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's some ongoing work that we have
going on right now and I'm not at liberty
[SPEAKER_02]: to speak about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whenever you're working in a room with
infected plants and you're saying change
[SPEAKER_04]: gloves and clean your worktop and bench
tops and all of the tools that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: using, I've heard because this viroid is
so small that it's very, very hard to kill
[SPEAKER_04]: because of that reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is like a protocol that you'll use in
your laboratory to stay as sterile as
[SPEAKER_04]: possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've just gone through a major clean out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see the plants are on the benches
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Between experiments, we bleach the entire
bench with 10% bleach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone has to wear a lab coat when
they're near our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lab coat stays in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't leave the room with the lab
coat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gloves stay in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our tools and shears stay in the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't leave that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not spreading it from room to
room with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We disinfect our tools regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually about 10% bleach works very
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite is cleaners is called
VirCon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use that on the floors quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use that also in dairies for making
sure that animal facilities are clean as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a commonly used virus side mixed with
other cleaners and we've used it in many
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: In over the last two decades quite
successfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: All pots have to be bleached before
they're reused or treated with the VirCon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of the new cleaners that
have come out since COVID work quite well
[SPEAKER_02]: against other viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can even go to Lowe's and pick up
some of the household cleaners that are
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be virus idle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Jeep is one of the ones that they
talk about and that works also as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's safe for humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not a botanist or anything,
but how closely similar is hops to hemp?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they like in the same family of
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the same order.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taxonomically, kingdom phylum class
order family.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're at the same order.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to follow up on the cleanup,
when you use your 10% bleach on your
[SPEAKER_05]: tools, about how long do you bleach for?
[SPEAKER_05]: And have you validated any of the timing
with your PCR assay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far we've been really, we've not had
any issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may just be that I've been a
virologist for so long that our materials
[SPEAKER_02]: stay pretty clean just from experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tend to bleach everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a number of projects in the
laboratory as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really are concerned about
contentment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a combination between projects and
between different pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do a 20 minute bleach, which is a
pretty standard approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everything is autoclaved for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of our tools are autoclaved or
autoclavable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're running PCRs every day,
we run enough controls that we can pick up
[SPEAKER_02]: on things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also, if we feel like it,
we will use .1 normal sodium hydroxide on
[SPEAKER_02]: our lab benches, which destroys any
nucleic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we may do, depending upon our
situation, we'll do that in our
[SPEAKER_02]: centrifuges as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to use bleach in the
centrifuges or some of the lab equipment,
[SPEAKER_02]: but .1 normal or .01 normal sodium
hydroxide kills everything without killing
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or damaging the machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
