[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting to see a lot of familiar
faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last CanMed was here at the conference
center.
[SPEAKER_01]: World is a very different place back then,
so I'm glad we can get everyone together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be talking today about a
large study that we conducted on CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we dive in, just to give you
guys some background on the approach that
[SPEAKER_01]: we took and who we actually are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, our mission as a company
here at Radical Science was really to
[SPEAKER_01]: democratize access to clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background, I started and ran UCLA's
cannabis research program for a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: years from 2017 to 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would not believe how ridiculously
so inexpensive it was for us to run
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was just the general bureaucracy of
any university.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because we received federal funding,
there were very strict requirements that
[SPEAKER_01]: we had to follow that were not law,
but there were requirements if you took
[SPEAKER_01]: federal funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I left in the middle of the
pandemic to start Radical Science to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to offer trials to non-prescription
health products starting with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we believe with data and with
trials, you're converting these natural
[SPEAKER_01]: health products into precision medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these precision medicines are
democratized, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can always get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to go through a health care
system or a doctor to get a hold on these
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what really drives us around
Radical Science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michelle from my team is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of context.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you might be familiar with my
co-founder, Pailin Thorogood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's a technology entrepreneur,
executive, and for the last five years,
[SPEAKER_01]: her foundation, the Holistic Foundation,
has been the largest single funder of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid research in American history.
[SPEAKER_01]: About $6 million of research they've
deployed to places like UC San Diego,
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Utah, Columbia University,
UC Irvine, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we met a number of years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really her coming from a big
data, technology, philanthropy angle,
[SPEAKER_01]: me coming from my background in medicine
and running clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we realized that the academic model
had a lot of shortcomings and that there
[SPEAKER_01]: was a lot that we could do in the private
sector with Radical Science to serve
[SPEAKER_01]: brands, to help them get the data they
needed, to make better products,
[SPEAKER_01]: to make claims, to grow their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a flood of people.
Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must have been holding the doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys were in line to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lined up half an hour in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we achieve these efficiencies of
Radical Science?
[SPEAKER_01]: This will make sense when I start talking
about our ACEs data.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it that we pulled off a 3,000
person trial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the first thing is we go completely
virtual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes sense that we started this
company during COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens when you have to eliminate
all the physical infrastructure of a
[SPEAKER_01]: university, all the infrastructure of
hospitals and clinics, all of the nursing
[SPEAKER_01]: staff, the research coordinators,
the doctors, all these people that drive
[SPEAKER_01]: up the cost and complexity?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you go completely virtual?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what if you go completely direct
to consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, Radical Science,
we are the ones directly communicating
[SPEAKER_01]: with a consumer to recruit them into the
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the ones directly shipping them
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the ones directly collecting data
from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the study, we do
something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: We analyze all their data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every participant in our study
actually gets a health report back that
[SPEAKER_01]: tracks their usage, their outcomes,
and gives them a sense of how they
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually don't pay any participants in
our studies, which is very unlike
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional clinical research.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third thing is because of these two
features, we can go large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as you go large scale,
the power of your study increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: The confidence in your results increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And furthermore, you can now start getting
at that precision medicine angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need large amounts of data to know
that people of this type of ethnicity,
[SPEAKER_01]: this type of gender, respond in this
manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only get there with large amounts
of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last thing is this intentional
heterogeneity.
[SPEAKER_01]: For pretty much the advent of trials,
they were intentionally homogenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the sample sizes were small,
you had to make all the participants look
[SPEAKER_01]: the same, or else there'd be too much
noise in the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because we went large, we can have
noise in the data and still make
[SPEAKER_01]: conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this intentional heterogeneity,
people from different geographies,
[SPEAKER_01]: people of different demographics,
different lifestyles, different
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-existing health conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so what was Radical ACEs all
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: ACEs stands for Advancing CBD Education
and Science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was actually Michelle from
my team here who helped us come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: that acronym.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know a lot of you are familiar with
this, but just to give you some brief
[SPEAKER_01]: background on why we thought it was
important for us to run this ACEs study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very difficult even to this day
for universities to study CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018 Farm Bill, CBD no longer a controlled
substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that same year Epidiolex was
approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually a law from the FDA,
whereas if you have a naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_01]: product and someone turns it into a drug
and it wasn't yet sold as a supplement,
[SPEAKER_01]: it basically is banned forever as a
supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if it was already being sold as a
supplement and someone turns it into drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: both are allowed to coexist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the case of CBD, the FDA is saying,
you know, this pharma company began their
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials much earlier than 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one really has presented evidence
that CBD was sold widely as a supplement
[SPEAKER_01]: prior to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the FDA keeps saying, you know,
drug preclusion, drug preclusion,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look up any of the warning letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying CBD is a drug, it can't be
sold as a supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens is when you're now a
university, you can't study CBD unless you
[SPEAKER_01]: study it under an investigational new drug
framework, which is dramatically more
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive, complex, and the brand that
wants to give you their product to study
[SPEAKER_01]: has to now basically treat their product
as a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be manufactured a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a certain amount of regulatory
filings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a non-starter for vast
majority of brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why universities, including
while I was at UCLA, we could not run a
[SPEAKER_01]: single study on any commercially available
CBD product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the context.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, thousands of products being sold
to tens of millions of Americans,
[SPEAKER_01]: universities can't really study any of
these commercially available products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we came onto the scene with ACEs,
our company was brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a small skeleton crew of employees,
and we said, hey, let's just go run the
[SPEAKER_01]: largest clinical trial on CBD ever done in
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the research team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll notice some of these names on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Russo, one of our co-authors and
collaborators here in the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well, but it was a wide variety of
people, our internal scientists,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as a variety of our collaborators
from academia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might actually recognize some of these
names on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a four week open label study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open label meaning the participants knew
what they were getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, our goal with this study
was actually to generate what I often
[SPEAKER_01]: refer to as real world evidence of
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when someone walks into a grocery
store, picks up a bottle of CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: they know that it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to use it in a certain
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our intention with this study was to
try to capture and mimic what's happening
[SPEAKER_01]: when people are buying a CBD product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not blinded to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kept it open label.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we did was we randomized people
to receive different CBD products,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as to serve as a control arm in
this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we recruited about 3,000 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get into this study, you had to have at
least one symptom of sleep disturbance,
[SPEAKER_01]: pain, or anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had to have something in those
three categories that you wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our main thing to look at was we were
actually interested in a holistic outcome
[SPEAKER_01]: measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to look at people's well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because well-being is often that
manifestation of a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: underlying changes in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the secondary outcomes was we
also wanted to look at specifically your
[SPEAKER_01]: pain, your sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that change as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, this was by well over an order of
magnitude the largest randomized clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trial in CBD ever conducted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here were the key health outcome
measures we used.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used validated health outcome measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't just on a scale of one to
five, like, how's your anxiety doing
[SPEAKER_01]: today?
[SPEAKER_01]: We used these validated outcome measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these have been run and developed by
academia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been used in many other clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're validated, you now know
that when a score, say, the promised sleep
[SPEAKER_01]: quality score, when that moves a certain
amount, you know if that's a clinically
[SPEAKER_01]: meaningful difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that kind of serves as a benchmark
where you can go look at other
[SPEAKER_01]: interventions done in other studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see, ah, that intervention changed
that validated outcome measure this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in our study, it changes this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that gives you a way to kind of
compare across studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to use these outcome
measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also looked at side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I want to briefly mention is the
timeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from when we came up with the idea to
when we completed the study was like about
[SPEAKER_01]: nine months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a type of trial that could
have easily taken five to plus years to
[SPEAKER_01]: conduct and publish in other settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were pretty proud of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, our company was a couple months
old when we came up with this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we had four employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things were a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here were the brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: The brands that participated, these were
the sponsors of ACEs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the brands I think are
actually exhibiting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the Thieler team walking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are the brands that
participated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice different form factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted a variety of different
products because the thousands of CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: products that any American combined,
they come in all shapes and sizes and
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations and dosages and form factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was, again, real world evidence
that we were trying to capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, form factor wise, there were
fast-melt tablets, capsules, tinctures,
[SPEAKER_01]: soft gels, gummies, oral sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also different dosages across
the board, as well as spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these products were full.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some were broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some were isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was another one of our hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is spectrum going to impact the
outcome measures?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of demographics, again,
we wanted intentional heterogeneity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at clinical studies
historically, women have largely been
[SPEAKER_01]: excluded and underrepresented in trials
for various reasons I'm not going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can look it up as to reasons why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our study, we're like, let's try to
get equal representation of women.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went out to recruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We leaned heavily on recruitment channels
that we knew would hit women.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were actually too successful
because like 90% of the study turned out
[SPEAKER_01]: to be women.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we succeeded, but not in the way that
we thought we would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to be fair, your average CBD user
tends to skew female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And women tend to be the purchasers of
health and wellness products for the
[SPEAKER_01]: household.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still doesn't explain this full
90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our studies that we're running now,
we've gotten back to 50-50 gender balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this study, definitely skewed
female.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are proud that we got people across
all 50 US states, which never happens in a
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a site-based trial at a university,
every single person in that study comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from a 10-mile driving radius of your
university.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not hitting people that come
from diverse socioeconomic background,
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse environmental exposures,
lifestyle, cultural factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things can impact our health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had good race and ethnic
diversity as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very briefly, what were we analyzing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were using this linear mixed model
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the gold standard for
analyzing this type of data from a
[SPEAKER_01]: biostatistical standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did a couple of comparisons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did was we took every single
product in the study and we compared it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the control group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we analyzed if we clustered the
products by, say, their spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: broad, full, isolate, by their doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the dosage?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did those clusters compare to one
another?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we looked at the characteristics
of people in the study, gender,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD use, and age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And were those predictive of whether you
would have a better or worse outcome?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is about precision medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The right person, the right dosage,
the right product for the right condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're trying to get at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are the outcome measures we looked
at across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll look at the highlighted line is
the control group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this group was recruited in the study
and they agreed to fill out surveys,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they did not receive any product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason you use a control group
like this is if something happens in the
[SPEAKER_01]: macro environment and you see the control
group's anxiety spike or maybe get a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: better, say it spikes when the war in
Ukraine happens, anxiety might fall when
[SPEAKER_01]: the COVID vaccine comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important to know because the
people that might be getting CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you see their anxiety spike or their
anxiety decline, you need to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's not due to a macro factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you compare them to the control group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, well-being increased
dramatically across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite statistically significant
across, this is where we aggregated the
[SPEAKER_01]: data from all the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anxiety plummeted and it was quite
significant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the chart on your right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we look at sleep, sleep
disturbance, aka dropping is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was less sleep disturbance in the
people receiving product as well as pain
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And notice in all these charts,
there's a very rapid drop in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: week to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it continues to improve,
but at a much slower ramp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw across the board that these
health outcomes, most of the improvements
[SPEAKER_01]: were seen in the first week and then had a
little gradual improvement to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the four-week study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to recap what we just saw on those
charts, the most beneficial effect we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 63% of people had a clinically
meaningful improvement in their anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Followed by sleep, 61% of people had a
clinically meaningful improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pain was the, it still improved,
but compared to sleep and anxiety had less
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: About less than half of people had a
meaningful improvement in their pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And clinically meaningful when you use
these validated outcome measures is
[SPEAKER_01]: scientifically defined.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means a significant palpable change
that would affect their quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we're seeing people are
indeed getting better across all these
[SPEAKER_01]: domains, including their wellbeing,
that holistic measure of their health as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we found no differences when we
clustered people by age or by gender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or by prior CBD use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of those variables were predictive
if someone was going to have a better or
[SPEAKER_01]: worse outcome from CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was an interesting finding from
the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also because I don't think there was a
talk here today, but you do find in mouse
[SPEAKER_01]: studies that there are sex differences
when it comes to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of that study has been on THC
specifically, but there is this
[SPEAKER_01]: theoretical sex difference that could
occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Side effects were pretty mild across the
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 10% of people had a side effect,
and pretty much all side effects were
[SPEAKER_01]: mild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most common ones were digestive in nature,
gas, flastulence, and diarrhea,
[SPEAKER_01]: bloating, which is in line with what you
see in the clinical trials of CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: say on Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had, the most common side effects were
often related to digestive issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so a couple caveats here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing, this is an open-label trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't disentangle the placebo
effect here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the studies we're running now are
blinded and placebo-controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in those instances, you can disentangle
the placebo effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the studies that we're running for
brands right now are intended to show that
[SPEAKER_01]: their product is indeed better than
placebo and kind of make these strong
[SPEAKER_01]: claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another caveat here is again, we had over
90% of the participants were female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially that's skewing the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been nice to have more male
representation in the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I show you the next slide,
keep in mind that yes, we grouped all
[SPEAKER_01]: these products by dosage, and then we
tried to see if there were any differences
[SPEAKER_01]: in outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just because you grouped all these
products by dosage, like lower dose
[SPEAKER_01]: products, moderate and high dose,
the product still differed in other
[SPEAKER_01]: attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The form factor was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spectrum was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had multiple criteria that were
different between products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even when we held and compared one
criteria at a time, just because,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, the spectrum of the product
didn't seem to make a difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't mean, in this study,
it's hard to actually conclude that the
[SPEAKER_01]: entourage effect doesn't work and that
spectrum doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because when you, again,
group all the products by, say,
[SPEAKER_01]: full spectrum, broad, and isolate,
and you see that there's no major
[SPEAKER_01]: differences across the board when you
group them that way, these products are
[SPEAKER_01]: still quite different in dose and form
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the full spectrum product did
indeed work better, but that product was a
[SPEAKER_01]: lower dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why you don't see a
difference when you compare it to a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: dose isolate aggregate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here were the final findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, all the products across the
group, improvements in well-being,
[SPEAKER_01]: pain, sleep, anxiety, pretty rare and mild
side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no characteristics in the
participants that we could find that could
[SPEAKER_01]: predict whether they were more or less
likely to benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not find any differences when we
grouped the products by spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the full spectrum products we studied
did not outperform the broad, did not
[SPEAKER_01]: outperform the isolate, and none were
better or worse in aggregate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was an interesting finding from
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we did find is that dose was not
king.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, there were products that had
lower doses of CBD that were often
[SPEAKER_01]: outperforming products with higher doses
of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way we had to run this study was
we had to anonymize and aggregate all the
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not allowed to actually tell you
which specific brands were outperforming
[SPEAKER_01]: other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we can tell you is that the lower
dose products, some of them were beating
[SPEAKER_01]: the higher dose products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's because their formulation
allowed for better absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was because the spectrum that
they had was able to counteract the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that they had a lower dose, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, one thing you commonly hear from
scientists is every great, I forget who
[SPEAKER_01]: said this, and I'm totally stealing it,
but it's like every great study warrants
[SPEAKER_01]: like four more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our first shot across the bow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've since followed up this study with
trials encompassing another probably
[SPEAKER_01]: 10,000 people studying minor cannabinoids,
CBD products, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hope that there's just more and more
science and research that can come out
[SPEAKER_01]: from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I believe we have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some time for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't leave me hanging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's got questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe my presentation was that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're stunned to silence.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was excellent talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was curious.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're doing everything virtually here.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you keep from biasing your sample
size to folks who can only get on
[SPEAKER_05]: virtually, for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to participate in the study,
we didn't even want to force people to
[SPEAKER_01]: download an app.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever had a parent
call you trying to figure out their Apple
[SPEAKER_01]: Store login.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone could participate as long as
they basically had internet and didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even need a phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could participate via text message.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could participate via email and email
you're checking from your phone or your
[SPEAKER_01]: laptop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you had internet and some
device that could get some communication,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, what you see in clinical trials
is that rural populations are not
[SPEAKER_01]: represented.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% of our participants came from rural
populations, which is really impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think from that diversity
standpoint, anyone that wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: participate and wanted to join could
pretty much participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of the bias question here,
the way that we, again, because it was an
[SPEAKER_01]: open label study, you can't take out the
placebo effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because we randomize people to the
different products, any confounding
[SPEAKER_01]: variables are kind of spread evenly across
the 13 products and brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, if any brands did have superior
outcomes, you can say that both of those
[SPEAKER_01]: products had similar participants
randomized to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any differences you see is not because
these participants also took supplements
[SPEAKER_01]: or drugs because that should have been
equal between all the products.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeff, thank you for your talk and the work
that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You showed in one slide that there was a
significant, some efficacy in the
[SPEAKER_09]: beginning for the first week.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was the dosing protocol the same
throughout the entire study or did you
[SPEAKER_09]: adjust the dosing suggestion?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was consistent across the whole study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for all the health outcome measures we
saw, most of the improvements happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: the first week.
[SPEAKER_01]: The participants were actually instructed
to use the products as the products were
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled and suggested the usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So effectively, we were letting the brands
drive the recommended usage by following
[SPEAKER_01]: the instructions of the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this study was all about real world
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the participants were instructed to
look at the suggested servings and usage
[SPEAKER_01]: of the product and use it accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, across the board, we saw that
all the improvements, most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: improvements were happening in that first
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, a little bit of
improvement that continued all the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: the tail end of the 30 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for your study.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we do need a lot more real
world evidence, so thank you again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Second question or first question is,
what is your understanding of the intent,
[SPEAKER_07]: is there any intent to look at the
formulations, the difference between the
[SPEAKER_07]: olive oils, the MCT oils, things like
that, shelf stabilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you can, what's the future of,
you just brought up a very good point,
[SPEAKER_07]: this one study is going to bring up four
more studies.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is the future for radical in your
group, sir?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought about trying to analyze the
data based on the formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some products were using olive oils,
some were using MCT oils, some were,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was no, they weren't oil based,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were sitting in a gummy matrix,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was just too many different
carrier matrices and oils, it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have been a useful cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's not necessarily something
that we can address with this one study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going forward, what we're running
studies on is, we're adding in blinding,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're adding in additional control
measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the brands that are coming to us,
sometimes they're doing their own,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have their own hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, their brand's coming to
us and they'll hand us six different
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same cannabinoids and it's
the same dose, but they're using six
[SPEAKER_01]: different carrier oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to figure out which one
works the best, if at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are the studies we're running
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we're blinding participants to
them, then we're really factoring out any
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the studies we're running now
to answer some of those questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's being driven by the brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really here to be there,
to carry out what their goals are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this an R&D goal, is it a claim goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, you've just turned clinical
research on its head, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, excellent vision and great work.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, how many of the products
had little to no effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so this was an open, every single
product had a quite significant
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: All 13 products across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both in aggregate, they all did really
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then individually, there wasn't a
single product that did not create
[SPEAKER_01]: significant improvements across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's an open label study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at people's belief in CBD,
it's high right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we can't disentangle how much of
that improvement was 10% of that
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement driven by the placebo effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it 20, was it 30%?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a series of blinded randomized
trials that we're running right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, they're already finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just analyzing the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are pretty much the first blinded
placebo controlled trials on CBD testing
[SPEAKER_01]: the dosage ranges that consumers are
using, which is well under control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under 100 milligrams and testing it for
some of these common conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like literally every day, my team's like,
is the data ready to look at you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did not see any loss of effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a relatively, 30 days is
still decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a one week study, it's 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've run 60 day studies in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen that the effect is actually
sustained all the way up to 60 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've not run studies beyond 60 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is a two part.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is just general understanding of the
nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two is logistics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I think full spectrum,
I'm thinking maybe there's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: THC in some of these products.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do you go about distributing
products that contain amounts of THC to
[SPEAKER_04]: all 50 states?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where it's about risk
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, in this case, our interpretation
of the 2018 farm bills that you can have
[SPEAKER_01]: permissible amounts of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, all the THC content was
quite low, well below 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that instance, our rationale as
researchers was these products are already
[SPEAKER_01]: being sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers are already buying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So us as researchers should be allowed to
take possession and ship them across state
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not a risk that a university
would be willing to take, but it's nice
[SPEAKER_01]: when you don't take federal funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the question is, I'm kind of a one
note song, like most people know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you doing any trials for people living
with dementia or Alzheimer's?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one restriction on how we conduct
our research is we can't study diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: without triggering an IND.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as we trigger an IND,
it means that the brands that want us to
[SPEAKER_01]: do studies for them, they're subject to an
IND as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means they now have to file a ton of
pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now imagine a CBD company trying to
file an IND with the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a non-starter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to be very clever with how we
study conditions without actually studying
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the short answer is no, we haven't
necessarily been studying these products
[SPEAKER_01]: on people with dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I would do is I would do a big
recruitment for anyone who believes
[SPEAKER_01]: they're suffering from poor memory.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless of how you've been diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get all those people into the study.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that fact, some subset of
them may or may not have certain diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't recruit for that disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not subject to an IND.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super clever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we get to attempt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's theoretically, we want to try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was curious if you'd had any follow up
with the participants after the study
[SPEAKER_00]: concluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they continued using the products
or if they continued seeing benefits after
[SPEAKER_00]: they stopped using products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you brought up a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just this week our research team was like,
you know, we should probably check in with
[SPEAKER_01]: the participants and just maybe try to
collect a little more information now that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're six months in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I will say is a majority of
participants in the study are opting in
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to continue to use the product and
wanting the brands to reach out and
[SPEAKER_01]: contact them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A significant majority.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they seem to be pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably should start following up now
that more time has elapsed to see what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Valentia and I have a high end
dispensary located in Carmel, California.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in the medical space since well
over a decade.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going on my 12th year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course, when we first started in
2008 when I had the first nonprofit on the
[SPEAKER_06]: Central Coast, we did see sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And pain being number one since pandemic.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen, of course, anxiety be number
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Mishulam taught me two and a half
years ago when I met with him that
[SPEAKER_06]: anywhere between 20 and 30 milligrams of
CBD, full spectrum will help not only with
[SPEAKER_06]: my MS, which I've had for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to be in a wheelchair, but I'm
confused because when I look at your
[SPEAKER_06]: study, I see a lot of hemp product in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were told or am I hearing you say,
let me ask the question.
[SPEAKER_06]: That the hemp lines part of the study,
the same as a THC line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, all of these products had
were hemp products and the ones that did
[SPEAKER_01]: have THC had tiny amounts of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least in our analysis, when we
compared all the products that were full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum, it came had some amount of THC
with the broad and the isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not see significant differences in
their outcomes, but they didn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: differ in spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: They differed in dose and form factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could have been that the spectrums
were outperforming, but they were lower
[SPEAKER_01]: dosed and that's why they were able to
match.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that we weren't able to, this study
wasn't designed to be able to address that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, in this case, very low amounts
of THC, like pretty tiny amounts,
[SPEAKER_01]: yet people were seeing these significant
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That probably explains why they weren't
being effective for sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need some THC for sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But potentially, I mean, in this case,
anxiety was the best performing outcome
[SPEAKER_01]: followed by sleep, followed by pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's just not enough
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, clearly there is clinical
trial data that THC helps with pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: the THC helps with sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that data doesn't exist yet for CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, with hemp then taking such a
priority in this role, where does it leave
[SPEAKER_06]: those of us that are licensed that have
spent a decade and millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_06]: getting licensed in the cannabis space in
terms of, I'm the only one in the entirety
[SPEAKER_06]: of California that has a pharmacist and
nurses together.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question then, where does this study,
thank you, thank you, and a female.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so where does this study leave our
patient community other than more
[SPEAKER_06]: confused?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are many people who can't
access THC and the best thing they could
[SPEAKER_01]: get by now is a CBD product that they
trust and maybe buy online or buy in a
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_01]: For folks who do have access to THC,
I think they should try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might find that one works better
than another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly there is more clinical data,
rigorous randomized controlled trial
[SPEAKER_01]: blinded data, that THC does indeed help
with pain and can help with the onset of
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep, making you fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now whether it gives you better sleep is a
different question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's data that it shows it
decreases sleep latency.
[SPEAKER_01]: That data does not exist for CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: This data is some of the closest data
we've gotten to actually what a CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: objectively do at these doses,
well under 100 milligrams for these
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the answer is if you can
access THC, try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have intolerable side effects,
then maybe try a predominant CBD product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're in a state that doesn't have
access to the cannabis, then you might
[SPEAKER_01]: only have options such as CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and last but not least,
all right, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question, so I believe the results you
showed us were comparing the mean scores
[SPEAKER_02]: on the various measures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you also looked at- Mean change.
Mean change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we basically took every participant's
baseline across the different health
[SPEAKER_01]: outcomes and tracked it each week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were assessing their severity of
symptoms every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but you mentioned that not all the
participants had a clinically significant
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you also look at the fraction of
individuals who had that clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement and maybe that varied across
the participant categories?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little muffled, but I think you
were saying did we look at of those that
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have a clinically meaningful
improvement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was just a response variable that
was either yes, they had a clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement or no, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could have reported the data as what
their score was.
[SPEAKER_01]: What your change percentage was,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on average, people's pain improved 30%,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the world of medicine, these
clinically meaningful cutoffs are more
[SPEAKER_01]: important, because I'll give you an
example, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a new drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll improve your pain by 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh, 20%, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that actually doesn't really hit the
cutoff for what is clinically meaningful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cutoff's about 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we went for in this study was
to say, hey, if this were judged as a
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical drug, how would a doctor
evaluate it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They would evaluate it based on the
percentage of people using it that had a
[SPEAKER_01]: clinically meaningful difference in their
pain or their sleep and their anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you just keep percentages,
your anxiety is 10% better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But does it warrant you paying money,
potentially having side effects to try
[SPEAKER_01]: this new product, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we basically converted the percentage
changes and the mean score changes and saw
[SPEAKER_01]: how many of them hit that threshold for
clinically meaningful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we got these numbers,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 63% of people in the study had a
clinically meaningful improvement in
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had a pharma drug that could
demonstrate that, that is going to do very
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And insurance companies would be happy to
reimburse for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, this was an open label study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some amount of that 63% of people,
some portion of that improvement was
[SPEAKER_01]: probably being driven by the placebo
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like anything, just like anything
that you study in an open label study,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's a supplement or meditation or
a pharma drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why there needs to be additional
studies on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was just our first shot across
the bow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in this last 30 days alone,
we've probably run trials on 6,000 people,
[SPEAKER_01]: blinded randomized trials on CBD,
CBG, CBN, CBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're exploring a bunch of different
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's literally an infinite,
there's like so much work to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need other researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need other people picking up and
running studies too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do it alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
