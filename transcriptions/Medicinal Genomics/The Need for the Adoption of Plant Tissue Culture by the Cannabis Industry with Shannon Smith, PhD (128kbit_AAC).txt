[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Dr. Shannon Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shannon received his PhD in molecular
biosciences from Middle Tennessee State
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, his research focused on plant
biotechnology with work in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: Panax, and vitis tissue culture and
manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This led to the development of new and
unique technologies for the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: both plants and secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: He later founded Greenway Lab,
a plant biotechnology company that
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborates with agricultural partners to
implement plant biotech solutions to
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical challenges facing the modern
agricultural industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our conversation, we discussed the
many advantages of using tissue culture in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivation, particularly for use
in propagation, cryopreservation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for storage, protection, and
reclamation of genetic IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without any further ado, please enjoy
my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: My conversation with Dr. Shannon Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Dr. Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm excited to talk with you today
about tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CanMed 24, you're presenting a poster
about recent advances in plant tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture that may solve three key problems
facing the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into those, I was hoping
you can give us an overview of what tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture is and how it's potentially
revolutionizing the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be glad to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tissue culture isn't of itself a sub
discipline of plant biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant biotechnology is just basically the
science of using various techniques and
[SPEAKER_03]: understandings that we've developed over
time to either make more plans or to
[SPEAKER_03]: investigate the plant kingdom and
specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tissue culture itself relies on a set of
evolutionary strategies that the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: kingdom has conserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants are, by their very nature,
sessile creatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is to say, except for some key
exceptions, plant tissue itself can't move
[SPEAKER_03]: on its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously pollen can move, and there's
certain exceptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a whole, plants can't move,
which leads them to having to deal with a
[SPEAKER_03]: threat that other creatures in the animal
kingdom, they have to have a different
[SPEAKER_03]: strategy for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, say, for instance, a predator is
coming after a gazelle or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: a gazelle can just run.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, say, for instance, you and I find an
absolutely delicious avocado tree,
[SPEAKER_03]: the avocado tree can't get up and leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the plant has to do is,
and what the conserved strategy is that
[SPEAKER_03]: they have favored, is plant cells can be a
little bit more plastic in their
[SPEAKER_03]: expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if, say, for instance, a plant is
injured by either a predator or a disease
[SPEAKER_03]: or a pest, like, say, for instance,
something's chewed on it or we've ripped
[SPEAKER_03]: off a section of it, et cetera,
the cells that are killed send a last gas
[SPEAKER_03]: message to the rest of the cells and the
plants in the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this chemical message then tells the
plant cells that are remaining,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, look, we've been injured.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they start a series of defensive
strategies to convert themselves into a
[SPEAKER_03]: undeveloped tissue and then replace the
tissues that they lose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, and also with some of them,
it tells them, hey, look, we're under
[SPEAKER_03]: attack from this threat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to switch production from this to
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are two things in plant tissue
culture that are basically the key
[SPEAKER_03]: concepts behind a lot of the expressions
of the technology that we use in industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the tissue culture process
sort of take advantage of those
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so with that, I've got a few
sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for a lot of these things, if the
audience wishes to do a deep dive,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is a review article that the Canadian
academic community worked together with
[SPEAKER_03]: the Canadian cannabis industry to look at
tissue culture as a whole and to just,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, basically here's a list of all of
these various strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little dense and it's a little big,
but it's a review article, so it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, a couple of the things that
you can do with it was you can take
[SPEAKER_03]: advantage of these various techniques to
either propagate tissues, to do longer
[SPEAKER_03]: term storage, to try to select for certain
elite traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, for instance, you want a crop,
then you want the fruit is bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or let's say, for instance, you're making
a cannabis line that produces a specific
[SPEAKER_03]: oil or like produces a heartier fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can select for those.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do, like I said, you can do
long-term storage, you can propagate,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can help guide growth and breeding
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there is some aspects of it that
help in disease prevention and disease
[SPEAKER_03]: recovery because, again, we're leveraging
the defense strategies of the plant and we
[SPEAKER_03]: can then actively select, like,
okay, hey, we have this situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: so let's specifically do this to deal with
this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so could you walk us through the
process of tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give you a very brass tacks,
very basic explanation of the tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture technique, and also I have some
images from both our research and also
[SPEAKER_03]: some cartoony ones that are a little bit
easier to see if, like, the screen's
[SPEAKER_03]: small, like they're watching it on their
phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the basic process of tissue culture is
first you do a selection of materials that
[SPEAKER_03]: you select a plant and you select the
tissues in question, and then you then you
[SPEAKER_03]: take and we'll pull up this cartoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll take a cutting from those
tissues and sterilize them.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so that you only are dealing with
the plants that you wish to deal with and
[SPEAKER_03]: not of any of the pathogens or any of the
other materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're specifically getting, you're only
selecting for, like, say, for instance,
[SPEAKER_03]: you only want marasam, which is like bud
tissue, or you only want leaf tissue,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you just get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you plate the tissues on a media
that has the cell signaling compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's those compounds that I said
beforehand where, like, the plant's
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, hey, look, this happened,
you need to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it grows into a mass of these
undeclared majors of cells of,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, undifferentiated tissue called
callus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you take and you start giving it
signals to say, like, hey, I want you to
[SPEAKER_03]: make roots or, hey, I want you to make
this compound or, hey, I want you to make
[SPEAKER_03]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for in this micro propagation slide,
what you're doing, what this is doing is
[SPEAKER_03]: we're taking some of the body tissue and
converting it into callus and then
[SPEAKER_03]: converting that tissue in the callus.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're making the callus grow over
and over again, we're also telling it to
[SPEAKER_03]: make more plant babies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's the cartoon version.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are some of the research pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might not necessarily be as clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an example where that upper
left, the white tissue, that was some
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings that I took off of a economically
threatened plant and we grew a whole mass
[SPEAKER_03]: of that tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally that amount of tissue would take
about two or three years to grow because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a perennial.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was grown in months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we convert those tissues into a
special subtype and start making plant
[SPEAKER_03]: babies.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one example.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from our lab currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working with some of our partners
and working, doing some work for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I took some cuttings off of one of
their mother plants and then did a then
[SPEAKER_03]: selected for tissues, plated, very small
tissues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys, what they start doing on
that little jelly media that they grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: that they they're in, they grow,
they reproduce, they grow, they reproduce,
[SPEAKER_03]: they get bigger, they reproduce and more
and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as they get to a certain size,
they start throwing shoots off and then we
[SPEAKER_03]: cut the shoots off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And propagate, cut the shoots off,
propagate until you get basic.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably a little bit more easy
for the audience to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's like the basic process of tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long does it take to get to that
sort of last stage, that last picture that
[SPEAKER_00]: you showed there?
[SPEAKER_03]: So with, again,
[SPEAKER_03]: this review has several authors where they
talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from my work and also from the work of
Dr. Lada and their colleagues,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can initiate a callus culture,
that mass of cells, normally in about like
[SPEAKER_03]: two to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they start and that just starts
growing and growing and growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for it varies per plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But since we're, you know, since we're
talking about cannabis, normally that you
[SPEAKER_03]: start the shoots and the roots that the
shoots in the full regenerated plants off
[SPEAKER_03]: of that callus, they're ready to go into
the ground after a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the callus is just sitting there
throwing shoots constantly and getting
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger, throwing shoots constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of say, for instance,
you're having a mother room where you have
[SPEAKER_03]: very tightly crowded plants and you have
threats from like mold and mildew and
[SPEAKER_03]: other fungal contaminants and like spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spider mites are a swear word to me
because they just get in and they never go
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are kept in a sterile environment
and in a much smaller space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can produce a large larger amount
of plants for square footage in a
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively quick time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because, for example, so for
traditional cutting, so like this is like
[SPEAKER_03]: an image of, you know, so you have your
mother plant, you cut it down to the nine
[SPEAKER_03]: hells and then you get that amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with micro prop, for instance,
you're only taking a smaller portion,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can, that smaller portion,
like the little circle area can produce
[SPEAKER_03]: the same amount, you know, as that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't necessarily need as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need as much square footage to
do the same job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you need to expand, you have that
available because no one's making more
[SPEAKER_03]: earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you were describing the
process, I think it's kind of clicked in
[SPEAKER_00]: my head, maybe for the first time is that,
so you're taking the small piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, you're putting it in the media and
it's sort of just sitting there waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: for instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're telling it what to do with
the hormones and everything that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding to the culture.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See the, the compounds in question they're
cell signaling compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are hormones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, it's literally the chemical
communication network for cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's their regular regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cell is like, Hey, I'm getting food,
but no one's telling me what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you, you have in the media that
you have, Oh, you need to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just starts doing it until it's told
to do something else.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are, so you mentioned sort of the,
the space saving advantage of using
[SPEAKER_00]: culture for propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, if any, are other advantages to,
to this method?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, our Canadian colleagues go
through and have pages of, of advantages
[SPEAKER_03]: to, to summarize the sterility process
removes a great deal of the threats that
[SPEAKER_03]: are currently in field grow and greenhouse
growing operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you, you're less likely to have to deal
with certain vectors coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can produce elite clones that,
so for instance, one of the strategies
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have with tissue culture is you
start opening up avenues of long-term
[SPEAKER_03]: storage that is not normally available
using traditional methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best traditional method for long-term
storage is normally converting to seed and
[SPEAKER_03]: then getting it into a seed vault.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that has a problem because seeds will
over time lose their viability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tissue culture opens up both
cryopreservation and artificial seed
[SPEAKER_03]: generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And artificial seed preservation is a
moderately long-term storage strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cryopreservation is a long-term storage
strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is for a situation where a client has
like an elite genome or elite germplasm
[SPEAKER_03]: that they are very concerned because
they're the only one in the world that has
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only in this one location and
they're one fire or one hops latent virus,
[SPEAKER_03]: or one funk contamination of the
extinguishment of that species or that
[SPEAKER_03]: subset.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you can do is you can convert it
into tissue culture and then do a
[SPEAKER_03]: cryopreservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a really quick freeze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can go store that long-term off
site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that allows to where you don't have
all your eggs in one basket.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at a later date, you can bring
that tissue back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since it's very plastic and convert,
you can then put it on tissue,
[SPEAKER_03]: plated tissues and grow it up and then
start having the calc start throwing
[SPEAKER_03]: shoots again and just regenerate from
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also allows, opens breeding
opportunities, genetic modification and
[SPEAKER_03]: compound modification where you can tell
the plant specifically since you were
[SPEAKER_03]: telling it what to do, you can use
techniques to say, hey, I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily want you safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like say for instance, hypothetically,
you have a plant that produces something
[SPEAKER_03]: that interacts with the endoplasm.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabinoid system, but one of the
compounds is legally dubious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can say, for instance, suppress the
compound that could possibly get the
[SPEAKER_03]: grower in trouble while up regulating the
compound that they're actually growing the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that you can stay in a hypothetical
situation of a plant that has one compound
[SPEAKER_03]: that is legally regulated while the other
ones are perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can then, I'll use tissue culture
techniques to make sure that your grow
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't go high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are just some, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So explain that a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the tissue culture process allow
you to sort of regulate those genes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so again, this is tissue culture
going back into the whole faction that
[SPEAKER_03]: this is plants can serve defensive
strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, there are, and it tells the plants
to do, you know, like, Hey, I need to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I need to grow this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The secondary metabolites are defense
compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not grown for the, for our
benefit, even though we can take advantage
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually grown to end us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's to be poisonous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that in like with all things,
the poison is in the dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oftentimes those things that are compounds
that are risky or poisonous to an organ.
[SPEAKER_03]: At lower levels can lower inflammation,
stop like, you know, redirect cells to
[SPEAKER_03]: where like immune cells are no longer
attacking their own bodies and so on and
[SPEAKER_03]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for plant tissue culture and for the
various biotechnological things,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can, we know what tells the plant to
go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Produce these compounds more because the
compounds are being produced in response
[SPEAKER_03]: to a threat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You trick it into thinking it has this
particular type of threat and it makes a
[SPEAKER_03]: particular type of compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it doesn't, at the end of the day,
it only has a certain budget of sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it has to take it from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you push something up, something
else has to go down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with these, you can use these
techniques to say, for instance,
[SPEAKER_03]: taking a lead germplasm that produces a
lot of a certain oil and say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: produce more of this because you're under
this attack when in fact it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not taking the damage that would
normally cause it and cause it to produce
[SPEAKER_03]: less issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just telling it to produce more of
the oil and it's still keeping the same
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that translate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you put the plant, you know,
into soil or some other media,
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually grow it as a plant,
or are you just keeping it in tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a couple of different
strategies for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the ways that you can do is you can
grow it in a callous suspension culture to
[SPEAKER_03]: where you just have a slurry of cells and
it's just producing this compound over and
[SPEAKER_03]: over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what specifically I was discussing is
a technique that I and some of my
[SPEAKER_03]: colleagues developed where we can hijack
that cell signaling pathway in plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: are already in, say, for instance,
the hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're already plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're already doing things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just use the technology that is
currently that growers are currently using
[SPEAKER_03]: for propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just say, Hey, give this cell signaling
compound under this dosage to the subject
[SPEAKER_03]: at these key points of development.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it will switch over and start is
like, Oh, I'm in an environment that has
[SPEAKER_03]: this threat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will respond accordingly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't have you don't have to have
it in tissue culture or for the client.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just we can leverage the defense
strategies of plant and have them use the
[SPEAKER_03]: technology that they're already used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same concept of when we were
talking about earlier of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: using the compounds or hormones in the
Petri dish to send signals to the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually do that in the hydroponic
system, like through, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water and nutrients that you're giving
it to produce the same effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just it's just a much larger
Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the most significant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, that is the wrong question.
It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some common misconceptions or
myths about tissue culture that you'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: to debunk?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I'm not sure if they're common
myths or the like, but there's a there's
[SPEAKER_03]: several questions that the clients always
come come to me when I'm discussing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if it's a myth or if I'm
just getting a small sample size.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll go with those.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're one of one of the concerns that
I've had several growers specifically
[SPEAKER_03]: because of regulatory threats.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so once we start doing this stuff,
you're doing all the science things.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to make how am I going to be
sure that what when I give you these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, they're going to be like they're
hemp right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what if they go hot?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have a history of going hot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, it's less than like it's less
than one percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to make it into marijuana?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, so like some of these things that I
don't think several people understand is
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're doing tissue culture,
you are making an exact clone of the
[SPEAKER_03]: mother, the donor tissue, unless you are
doing genetic modification specifically,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is another step.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just clone that process,
whatever I it's whatever genetics it has
[SPEAKER_03]: is what the daughter is going to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it's not going to suddenly like
it's not a like 0.02 percent THC plant is
[SPEAKER_03]: not suddenly going to go 20 percent just
because it crossed the threshold of my
[SPEAKER_03]: door.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unless we do a lot of extra heavy
lifting to like insert things,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one is that they have a lot of
questions is whether or not it will impact
[SPEAKER_03]: the growers organic certifications.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which that it's not necessarily like a
science myth, but it's like it's something
[SPEAKER_03]: that is very much so of interest to the
client.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is organic or not is a government
regulation and tissue culture does not
[SPEAKER_03]: impact your organic certifications at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's apples to aircraft carriers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it would have no more impact on
your organic certifications on whether or
[SPEAKER_03]: not you used an electronic vehicle to
transport your cannabis versus like a gas
[SPEAKER_03]: powered vehicle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just we don't it doesn't the
regulations don't apply to us because what
[SPEAKER_03]: we're doing, we're only like.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have the genetic expressions of
the plant that we begin with and the
[SPEAKER_03]: daughter is the exact it's an exact clone
of the mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if if once I hand it to you,
if you continue to do your organics,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's still organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I haven't I haven't messed up
with any of your.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two that I always get asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if they're myths,
but it's like questions that the clients
[SPEAKER_03]: always have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought I'd bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brings up another question,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are working with a client,
so we talked about the different
[SPEAKER_00]: applications of tissue culture,
whether it's propagation, preservation,
[SPEAKER_00]: remediation or sort of genetic
modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is like the most common
application that you're using with your
[SPEAKER_00]: clients?
[SPEAKER_03]: So with some of that, I'm going I need to
be a little bit agey in the sense I can't
[SPEAKER_03]: say what I'm doing with my clients,
but what I because of NDAs sort of in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, there's a couple different
things that the clients are all that are
[SPEAKER_03]: always asking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: The three big ones would be plant
propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and this is also probably I think this
is also probably like industry wide for
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue plant propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: See here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Storage for safety because of the various
disease outbreaks and some fires.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happened last year in certain states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the growers lost some of their
crops due to wildfires.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they need some form of like third party
preservations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the propagation and preservations and
disease prevention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those would be the three things that the
industry as a whole very much so is very
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because of the way that tissue
culture works.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their solutions for for the clients
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent and now interest in general for
tissue culture, even awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that growing in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing very slowly interest interest high
understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a barrier to entry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they they they want to know they hear
the term, but they when they want to know
[SPEAKER_03]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't have access.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things like this podcast is very
helpful for for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not the growers or the industry's
fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: Agriculture as a whole has has very wholly
adopted plant biotechnology and tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture for their production methods and
various other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But due to regulatory restraints,
cannabis has has been a lagging.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis industry has lagged behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not their fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's barriers to getting that
information to and from and to and from
[SPEAKER_03]: the scientific community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, things like can med and the
various other cons are starting to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, clients are starting to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, who do I talk to in the
industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do I talk to in academia?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there is a growing interest and a
growing understanding, but we're due to
[SPEAKER_03]: several of the regulatory roadblocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis industry is having to play
catch up from the rest of the agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I guess with that in mind,
are there certain things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess now here's a platform that
you wish growers growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me let me start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there certain things that you wish
growers knew about tissue culture that
[SPEAKER_00]: they might not have a good understanding
of right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's several of the with the
ongoing changes that they're facing from a
[SPEAKER_03]: biological perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my region, our rainy or rains are
coming in different time periods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our winters are not as cold, so pests and
threats and pathogens that weren't a
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my region are suddenly becoming a
problem and industries are having to play
[SPEAKER_03]: catch up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for several of these problems that
are that are future facing because farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: and agricultural, they have to drive well
ahead of the hood of their car.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like the clients right now,
you know, even though it's like twenty
[SPEAKER_03]: twenty four and it's just spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Agriculture is like, OK, we've got twenty
twenty four.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we doing in twenty twenty five?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we doing in twenty twenty six?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we going to be dealing with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So with these problems that they're the
future problems, plant tissue culture
[SPEAKER_03]: options are available to help future proof
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can help work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Store your store your germplasm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually have a facility built at
your location.
[SPEAKER_03]: And be trained and have to where
partnerships you can do your own tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture work and like you start to retire
certain aspects of your production that
[SPEAKER_03]: are high risk for infection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or bottlenecks for production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those would be like, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The there's some problems that you guys
are facing and they're only going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: more complicated, so it's.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the quicker you adapt and adopt the
new strategies that your.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colleagues over and the other rest of the
agricultural fields are doing the safer
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to be in the more long term
that we can help make you be as a company
[SPEAKER_03]: and as a client.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now is cost a barrier or a perceived
barrier?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cost startups costs can be a perceived
barrier depending on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're if you're trying to if a client
is trying to build a full fully functional
[SPEAKER_03]: cloning facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is obviously if you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Capital intensive, but you can part there
are companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, you know,
like self plug, you know, my company,
[SPEAKER_03]: for instance, that they will they you can
partner with them and you can work kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: a situation where you know you go have Z's
in on the work and you know over time
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe convert a facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of individuals don't realize that
you don't necessarily have to build this
[SPEAKER_03]: facility from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you can just convert a section
and the for instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: This this review goes into where ends with
several of the cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were able to flip and convert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally they thought like hey,
yeah, this is a high cost barrier to
[SPEAKER_03]: entry, but they were able to actually
convert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it ended up being a cost saving method
and they were able to convert to redirect
[SPEAKER_03]: the capital into other ventures and expand
that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it is a perceived.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a perceived barrier, but it is not
necessarily always as accurate as people
[SPEAKER_03]: believe it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as it's not as much of a barrier
as people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they just don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't have the technology or the
experience and can't blame them for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that was going to be my next
question is, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can the average cultivator do they have
the skills necessary to be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a very kind of specific set of
skills that you need to sort of hire for
[SPEAKER_00]: or or consult with the company?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a hard question to answer because
it depends on the cultivator.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be trained.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are good enough to handle the in
and outs of agronomy, plant breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: running a greenhouse, handling various
fertilizers and vertigation systems,
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to handle all of those
techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's a lot of that's a lot of
experience and technical know how.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have the skill set to do that,
you can learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also hire individuals coming out
of academia.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a slew of good programs for
where the and here's one thing that is a
[SPEAKER_03]: disconnect and something that I want to
have like tell the agricultural community.
[SPEAKER_03]: The agricultural community is like,
hey, look, we're looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to find these people that
have the skill sets and academia is like
[SPEAKER_03]: we're producing these people that have
these skill sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could find a job with these skill
sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's there's this like this so close,
so close.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, yeah, you can you can hire
individuals, but like a technician,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't need necessarily to get a PhD.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need technicians that are like
bachelors, lab tech, lab heads that can be
[SPEAKER_03]: masters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those those levels of education are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easily able to handle it, but also you can
be trained.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so like if you if you can handle a
vertigation system, you can handle the SLT
[SPEAKER_03]: cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, and that's one great thing about
about cannabis growers and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and farmers in general is they
have to be a little bit of a jack of all
[SPEAKER_00]: trades and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, be familiar with all different
systems and sort of create their own
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions to problems too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, for example, one of the partners
I have, he's an agronomist.
[SPEAKER_03]: James Clint Palmer, he's an agronomist,
very much so, breeds his own cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great greenhouse guy, but he also knows
how to use an HPLC mass spec and he has
[SPEAKER_03]: like an analyzer in like one of his
closets that he uses to analyze the
[SPEAKER_03]: chemical profile of the plants that he's
that he's breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like the jack of all trades,
it's like you would if you know if you
[SPEAKER_03]: have ever meet Clint, which I actually do
recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a great guy and very knowledgeable
when it comes to plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would not.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would be like you have a what where
it's like, oh yeah, let's just run an
[SPEAKER_03]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, so yeah, so that's just an
example of an agronomist who.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people, if I say HPLC mass spec,
they'll they'll be like, so are we doing
[SPEAKER_03]: CSI or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so yeah, like they can learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so so winding down here,
I was wondering if you could discuss any
[SPEAKER_00]: ongoing research or collaborations that
you're currently involved with related to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can very vaguely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lawyers slightly suddenly appearing in
my office.
[SPEAKER_03]: NDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are working with individuals to
breed some of they have some very
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting germplasm that produces some
very interesting traits and they want to
[SPEAKER_03]: make a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is a little bit more and I
have to be very careful not only for my
[SPEAKER_03]: own legal reasons, but because you know
this is regulatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the region that I'm in,
our last two seasons have been very rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: On on the the agricultural as a whole,
but several of the cannabis growers who
[SPEAKER_03]: are growing completely legal hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly went hot and they only had hemp
license, so they had to lose my comment
[SPEAKER_03]: about like you have to they have to drive
their car several car hoods in advance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a tree just jumped out in front of
him, so we're developing technologies to
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically make it to where they can
lessen their risk of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going out of control just from just from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Environmental stressors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, developing those.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I get permission to, I'd love to show
you the curves that were that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting in our results.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very, they're very sexy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very, very nice plots and Excel
spreadsheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually environmental factors
sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Messed with the cannabinoid ratios.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, oh very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, cannabinoid ratios are a defense
strategy for the plant and the plant will
[SPEAKER_03]: try to defend itself versus environmental
stressors just as much as it will defend
[SPEAKER_03]: itself from versus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Versus like chewing damage or you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Various other predatory damage,
so yes, very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So working on something to make it to
where they can future proof their their
[SPEAKER_03]: crops versus you know these environmental
threats.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not cannabis related, but it's tissue
culture related.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are certain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Companies that produce I'm pretty sure
you've heard the term super food.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm talking about with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's a it's a food that happens to
have like a massive amount of something
[SPEAKER_03]: like a vitamin C or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people with some plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: To make their elite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Varieties more elite like.
[SPEAKER_03]: More concentrated so that they can go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey look here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're producing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say we're producing a
tangerine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has like more vitamin C than you
could ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Editors note we're not working with
insurance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like using that as an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that's some of the ongoing work
that we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I know you already shared a few
great resources that folks can look at or
[SPEAKER_00]: read about to learn more about this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you can include other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mention them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me in an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in the show description.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, if people want to learn
more about you, the work that you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: or me perhaps get in touch with you,
please plug away any website, social
[SPEAKER_00]: media, anything that you use to to connect
with folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so first, let's go with the citations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're wanting to learn more about
prior preservation techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to pull up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are two articles.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is in nature and the other one is in
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those go into detail about prior
preservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, also.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also for understanding how tissue
culture is used to deal with viral
[SPEAKER_03]: threats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is here are two articles that they
can go into a deeper dive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under siege, the virus control and plant
maristons and progeny and the nation of
[SPEAKER_03]: hot plate and viral from hot plants by
cold treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those goes with several.
[SPEAKER_03]: The techniques and the explanation of how
to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are some more primary literature
sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and if you want to contact me.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our company has a website Greenway lab dot
co.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a contact us there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have my professional email that'll go
directly to my office so I can be
[SPEAKER_03]: contacted there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of those, if you are interested in,
say, for instance, discussing,
[SPEAKER_03]: say, like, hey, look, we would like to do
some tissue culture or hey, look,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're interested in maybe doing building a
tissue culture facility and expanding in
[SPEAKER_03]: an area or hey, hey, can we talk about
preserving?
[SPEAKER_03]: We can be reached out that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either through Greenway lab CEO,
which.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you if you don't have it after we're
done, I'll I'll give you I'll give you the
[SPEAKER_03]: link.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can you put in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we covered everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you doing it,
Shannon, and I look forward to seeing you
[SPEAKER_00]: down in Florida for camera 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it and it was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, like any time you want to any
time you want to hit up and just nerd out
[SPEAKER_03]: about plants or have some questions,
feel free to reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one thing about plant
scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're like, hey, what's this?
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have a drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if we don't know, we'll we'll be
like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I must find out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like here, let me share you with
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, feel free to reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
