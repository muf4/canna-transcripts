[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna go over the molecular
biology that's going on with hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of what we know about hoplite and
viroid we are assuming from what we know
[SPEAKER_00]: about other viroids that in fact other
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some leaps that are being
made here, but I think you'll find by the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of this that they're beginning to
resonate with what we're seeing in other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm thankful for Zemir actually
giving you a big background on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bio-burden of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm gonna try to do is describe what
we think this is doing in the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe that will guide us in a direction of
breeding away from this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture of hoplite and viroid
sequence through RNA fold up there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: upper right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very large, it doesn't code for
any proteins, it's just a piece of RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the heck is this doing in the
plant to create such a tremendous downfall
[SPEAKER_00]: in yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: The going hypothesis in other viroids is
that this is acting through an RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: interference pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes so much of this RNA that that RNA
eventually hybridizes to some transcripts
[SPEAKER_00]: that share sequence homology with it and
then some enzymes, nodins, argonaut,
[SPEAKER_00]: and dicer come in and dice up this RNA and
as an effect down-regulate the expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of genes that have sequence homology to
hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we were playing around with
designing primers for more optimal PCR
[SPEAKER_00]: with this, I think it was either Liam or
Steve and our bioinformatics group blasted
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing against the Jamaican lion
genome and came up with all these hits
[SPEAKER_00]: saying we probably shouldn't put primers
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we might amplify the cannabis genome
and have a bad test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, that got us thinking,
well, wait a minute, maybe that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically meaningful outside of just
your primer design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this actually has a function going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture of a hoplite and
viroid genome with two mutations in it
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the reference that was
published in 1988 and what happens is the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the viroid completely
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you a comparison in the next
slide, but just to get yourself a handle
[SPEAKER_00]: on some of the parts of this viroid,
there's a central controlled region in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle which has two overlapping
quadriplex G structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those structures are generally,
we believe, ribozymes, although this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular viroid has not been reported to
have any ribozyme activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still unknown how this is replicating
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The belief is that a DNA-dependent RNA
polymerase amplifies an RNA template,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is somewhat not very believable,
but that's the going thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that a enzyme that's supposed to
replicate DNA somehow mistakenly
[SPEAKER_00]: replicates RNA into more RNA, and then
this creates a long linear template,
[SPEAKER_00]: since this is circular, and that long
linear template then gets processed into
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller 256 base pair pieces and then
recircularized, and we don't know any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the enzymes that are doing that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what you'll notice is we've decorated
certain portions of this viroid with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence regions where they have homology
to certain genes in the cannabis genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's going to become important as we
step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that the variants in this
can make a very big impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just put two SNPs in this,
you will see the structure on the left
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the structure on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also changes the footprint that it
may have in the cannabis reference,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're dealing with very short
homologies here, just 17 to 25 base pair
[SPEAKER_00]: homologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You switch one or two bases in some of
those regions, and it goes to completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the variation we need to keep track of
in the field to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathology of this doesn't shift over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you take everything that we found
that are 17 bases and higher, there's 25
[SPEAKER_00]: genes in the cannabis genome that this has
homology to, and may have some down
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation impact on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set out to measure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to touch on that a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part I want to touch on is how
much variation is there in the population
[SPEAKER_00]: with hoplite and viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we dealing with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we dealing with a COVID that's
changing every three months from an alpha
[SPEAKER_00]: to an omicron, or are we dealing with a
fairly consistent viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: The literature implies this DNA-dependent
RNA polymerase should make lots of errors
[SPEAKER_00]: copying this, and so people believe it's
going to be a quasi-species, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't even share the same sequence
within one organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It begins to get heteroplasmic than an
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to show you some data
that suggests we're already skeptical of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a site that we built called
Viripedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people are testing their strains,
they sometimes want to submit their
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid strains into us for
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sequence them and then put them public
so that we have a mechanism to track the
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic throughout the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also does some of the RNA folding
information and then blasts those novel
[SPEAKER_00]: variants against the cannabis genome to
see if you have any novel RNAi locations
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be at bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a little painted picture like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the color coding on the
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the color codings of the regions
in the genome that they have homology to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of the most common genes that we
find is a gene known as COG7.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a gene involved in shoot apical
meristem growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one called expansion,
which is involved in cell development and
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one called clasp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll touch on a few more of the ones that
were in that long spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many genes that this is
potentially interacting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the variation look like in NCBI?
[SPEAKER_00]: NCBI has been collecting information on
this from the late 1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 155 genomes in NCBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all vary in length and they all vary
in sequence context dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been studying this for quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the picture looks like of the
variation in NCBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of those white marks on the
sequence are a variant in all the little
[SPEAKER_00]: dots or areas where there's just no
sequence at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This had people worried that there was a
lot of variation in the length of the
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as we've come to study this more,
we're recognizing that this is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult RNA molecule to sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hairpin, so it's completely
self-complementary in most places.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to try and sequence this,
even Sanger sequencing chokes up on this
[SPEAKER_00]: and creates a lot of error.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of these we're finding are
potentially sequencing error that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring, trying to sequence this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a circular RNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, what we're seeing as we go about
and categorize all these variants is the
[SPEAKER_00]: vast majority of the variants are what is
known as Can-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darkheart Nursery, when they first came
out with this, said we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: predominantly two variants, Can-1 and
Can-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can-1 is the puncta reference that was
discovered in hops in the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can-2 is what they're finding in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other variants we see are minor
variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to see in that graph,
but the majority of those strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: over 130 of them have this U225A change
known as Can-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of them are a bunch of,
I would say, perhaps sequencing artifacts,
[SPEAKER_00]: are very rare variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these variants are actually
condensing or consolidating themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: under primers that have been published in
the literature for people surveying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably something going on with
Sanger sequencing where we get poor
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing over the primer sites and we
have a higher increase in error rate on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we chart these from the people that
send them in, this is a representation of
[SPEAKER_00]: about 18 different locations that have
sent samples in for sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dots on the map actually represent
many, many samples that came from that
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, the work in Massachusetts
from Fino Express probably represents
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff from all over New England.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, the Darkheart is a nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably are getting samples from all
over California and the Pac Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's much more diverse and spread apart
than what you're seeing these dots
[SPEAKER_00]: represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the important thing is to see here is
Can-1 and Can-2 are all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't one particular pocket of one
variant versus another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in China, they're in the Pac
Northwest, and they both seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading somewhat equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so how do we validate a test to
make sure we can pick up all this
[SPEAKER_00]: variation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Important thing is that you have very high
sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to confuse that with
specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put primers in the wrong place on
this viroid, you can get some background
[SPEAKER_00]: off the cannabis genome because there's a
lot of homology to the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also should have more than two primer
sets because you don't want to put some of
[SPEAKER_00]: your primer sets on one of those variants
and then they don't amplify and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: only surveying Can-1 versus Can-2 and
missing any of the rare variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA tests need a lot more scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA is really easy to predict where your
primers are going to land.
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA, you can't really predict where
they're going to land because we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have complete surveys of every
transcriptome under every condition out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with alternate splicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with circular RNAs known as
lariates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting primers to work in RNA,
you really have to test them against real
[SPEAKER_00]: living organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just do in silica predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gone through and tested this on
50 different organisms that were commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: found in cannabis to show that they don't
interact with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we even went through the painstaking
effort of chemically synthesizing 25
[SPEAKER_00]: different viroids to prove that we could
hit those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reality is only a couple of these really
matter at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not seeing high prevalence of the
other ones in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third question is where do you survey in
the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually something that has
evolved over time as we've learned more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been involved in two or three
studies that showed really high CTs,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say higher viroid loads in the
leaves than in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in one study where it showed
higher CTs in the roots where things were
[SPEAKER_00]: completely missed in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to touch on another study
that we've been doing that shows some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that only harbor this in the roots
and they don't even spread it out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may actually shed some light on
some of the tolerances it's having.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the moment, testing both tissues
probably makes a lot of sense because we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't actually know where this is always
going to land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what can we do now that we know about
where the homology is against the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're seeing in these gray boxes are
the regions of the viroid that have
[SPEAKER_00]: homology to different regions in the
cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can track for variants when they
fall inside those regions to know that if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a new variant circulating,
maybe this is changing its target in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a Sanger sequencing
program in place to sequence these things
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly so that we can survey if
there's anything changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to this, we wanted to ask
the question of what is happening in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome from an RNA perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you infect a plant versus a control
clone, do you get different gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does that gene expression give you any
sense of the pathology of the viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took a Jamaican lion clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mother plant that we sequenced
many years ago and put the reference
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is still circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to get clones from the
mother, infect one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we weren't able to actually infect
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took some of the advice from Zemir to
try to use Q-tips and swab viroid on cut
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would not infect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried that three times, waiting two
weeks between each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would not go positive on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we finally broke a branch off the
bottom of a plant and used a P1000 to
[SPEAKER_00]: inject the viroid right into the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks later, we were positive in the
roots but nowhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was just an oddity we weren't
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it turns out throughout the course of
this study, what we did is we sampled the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sampled the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sampled the flowers and the maristems
in triplicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single week for 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sequenced those with over 40 to 50
million reads per sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is about 80 libraries with
terabytes of sequencing information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're trying to do is track this
between infected and non-infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw through the course of time
is that this would continue to be negative
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're doing basically 16 QPCRs every
week across the entire time scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was always negative in the leaves and
only positive in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we did start to notice toward
the end of its life cycle is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and the leaves just jacked up the
anthocyanin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be an immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not seeing this as heavily
increased in the control that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pushed this beyond its actual
flowering time and just said, let's see if
[SPEAKER_00]: it dies in the vine and does it finally
make itself into the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go a couple weeks past flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we did that, we began testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single tissue we tested 57 out
of 57 of these were negative if the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: was purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we found some parts of the plant that
were lower branches that looked a little
[SPEAKER_00]: scraggly like you can see there on the
upper, I guess on your side, the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that particular branch, seven out of
seven were positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after flowering time, when we really
stressed this thing out, we could see a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of the lower branches get positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the top canopy, anything that was
purple and had anthocyanin production was
[SPEAKER_00]: not testing positive for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we don't have good cannabinoid
measurements on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't give you a good sense of yield
other than the growers that have handled
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing for five years do not see a
measurable difference by eye of the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: weight in the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we clearly don't have SCMs and HPLCs
on this to confirm that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that needs to be probably repeated now
that we have an idea of what this
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment might yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't go into this anticipating this
outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some literature out there
that tie viroid infection with increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoid production and anthocyanin
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we aren't the first to find this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others have listed genes that they believe
have different transcriptional loads when
[SPEAKER_00]: their viroids are infecting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do point back to flavonoid
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if this is a defense
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know cause and effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just an interesting observation
that these may be playing a role in what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if you're not familiar with these
types of plots, these are integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: genome viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plots of sequencing read
coverage across particular transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we wanted to see is,
is this RNAi happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to see down regulation of
particular genes that have homology to
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplate and viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we scan across a few of these,
we can certainly see, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's COG7.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the ones that are HLD infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a decrease in expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: But note, the decrease in expression is
only over that short window of where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's interaction with the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire transcript isn't gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just knocking out that particular
region of the transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was also seen in the class gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some down regulation of the
window where there's homology to HLVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does not kill the entire
transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an interesting observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bit more of a global picture of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry that the fonts there aren't very
helpful for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that this is differential
gene expression on the 25 different genes
[SPEAKER_00]: I had in that initial table and across a
variety of samples that are infected
[SPEAKER_00]: versus not infected in lees, in roots,
in a tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could do a better job with the
laser here, I'd point out to you some
[SPEAKER_00]: features here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is happening is on the left side
is predominantly samples that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right side are samples that are
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still kind of combing through
what all this means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there does seem to be some trends for
changes in gene expression based on
[SPEAKER_00]: infection and non-infection in tissue
specific as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question people ask is you have
this much RNA sequencing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you pick up any hoplite and virate in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't have because we used poly A
capture to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the virate is at such high
concentration, it comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sequence it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there isn't a quasi-species thing going
on in this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one clonal copy of HPLVD across all
the tissues that we found it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that happens when you
start looking for this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination, or I should say sequence in
there, is you begin asking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a large database of 1,834
genomes now that we can then ask this
[SPEAKER_00]: question, are there variations underneath
these HPLVD targets that may change the
[SPEAKER_00]: way this RNA interference behaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, this gives you kind of a
picture of COG7.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the SNPs down there at the bottom
track, you can see this is a densely
[SPEAKER_00]: covered area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a SNP probably every 50 bases in
our database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're dealing with 25 MERS,
you're going to find some SNPs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, in fact, the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an alignment of COG7 across
just a window of some of the cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in the Canapedia database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there are variants that
exist in the target of homology for HPLVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be nice targets to basically
breed and then challenge to see if they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have a reduced phenotype or loss
of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the same thing in the CLASP
gene as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can march through every one of these
gene targets, and you can see that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are variants that exist out in the
population that alter the footprint for
[SPEAKER_00]: HPLVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're candidates for potential
genetic tolerance, I would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: to this virus, or viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got to keep in mind,
the way this thing replicates is we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will probably get into a plant and
replicate, but it may not have RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: interference capacity to shut down the
actual pathology or the growth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it may still be PCR positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we've seen in the hop
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hop industries have this problem for
40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never gone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we know from Zemir that there's
seed transmission, maybe pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission, there's paper suggesting
viroids move in fungal mycelium,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can move in fusarium spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to bleach our way out of
this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to breed our way out
of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, I think, is what has happened in
the hop field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have found cultivars out there that
just have a reduced loss in secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not perfect, but they take it from
being 40% loss down to like 5% loss,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they work with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, part of this discovery, when you
sequence all the RNA in something,
[SPEAKER_00]: is you find out something that blows your
entire experiment apart, and that is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants we're working with had
cucumber mosaic virus in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has never been found in cannabis
before, and we now have a good sequence of
[SPEAKER_00]: its genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, in fact, in cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, its tissue tropism is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're finding HPOVD in the roots,
predominantly in our plants, this thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: not in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the other tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot more polymorphic inside
these tissues than hop late in viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a snip almost every 20 bases
inside of its genome, and it was different
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that the primers we designed to
target cucumber mosaic virus off of other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants don't work on the virus that's in
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has mutated itself on its zoonotic
[SPEAKER_00]: body, and it's a lot more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another one that we should keep
an eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I can go backwards on this,
can I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll notice some of those leaves and
upper lip picture that we missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a little bit of a mosaic
pattern there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what's going on,
is that plant actually had CMV in it as we
[SPEAKER_00]: can detect, but we just didn't make note
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably blame that on something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I've got enough time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, we don't see evidence of
hop late in viroid being a quasi-species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although literature suggests otherwise,
but we're just not seeing it from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send in samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll sequence more and track this for the
industry, because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: important in case it does mutate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the plants can keep HLV in the
roots and remain relatively asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to cut and kill every
plant that's positive only in the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might lose the plants that are,
in fact, most tolerant to get us out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand if you have something like
this in your grow, you've got to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the process of doing so,
be aware of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want an isolation room where you
can find the plants that have very low
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid load and start greeting with those
and keep them away from your facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're doing your production,
because that might be a better long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: plan than just being on a PCR treadmill
the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are phenotypes of CMV and HBLVD
overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do more screening for CMV to
see what's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sequencing some of the mothers and the
viroids we think can provide you a
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term strategy for how to reach your
way through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think with that, I'm going to skip
over the end of these slides and just
[SPEAKER_00]: thank these people for helping us out in
all this work and help you take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be short on time for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's giving me the hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be at lunch.
Thank you.
