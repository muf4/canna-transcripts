[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for inviting me here to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is David Mary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a laboratory in the Technion,
which is similar to the MIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Technology Institute of Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it was similar to the MIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my master's in biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a PhD in plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by kind of a mistake, I did my postdoc
in Toronto in cancer biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came back to Israel and got my own
lab, I got a laboratory for cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep without my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I got my laboratory and I started,
one of the papers that I saw that quote
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my work in my postdoc show that
treating breast cancer with cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: block the ability of these cells to
migrate to create metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that I did in my
postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked very interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to keep going with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started to read about cannabis
and cancer, I saw that there are a few
[SPEAKER_00]: papers that showing that treating cancer
with cannabis can create apoptosis to
[SPEAKER_00]: these cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apoptosis is like when cells
committing suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every cell in our body have a machinery
that they check itself all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is checkpoints.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something is wrong, he is committing
suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cancer, it's a given name to hundreds
of different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we put them in all the same box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said every time that we see all
these phenomena, we will call it cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first phenomena is that the cell
can avoid apoptosis, that they avoid this
[SPEAKER_00]: committing suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they are standing there and
become more and more violent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a scientist, as a researcher for
cancer, you want to have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring back these phenomena, this killing,
that they will kill themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question, when we approach
this question, this work, we ask which
[SPEAKER_00]: type of cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw that in breast cancer,
there is publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that in glioblastoma, there is
publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about other cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hundreds of different types of
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And second, what the hell is cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, I am a plant biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if you grow a plant,
if you pick a plant in different time of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, I'm a son of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pick strawberries in the morning or
afternoon, they have a different taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sweeter in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you a secret, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: But because they're doing photosynthesis
and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the same thing for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that there is sativa,
indica, erudillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the different soils that you grow
them that will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Israel, we have 91 different strains
that the patient can face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every strain, it's like a different
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which kind of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we should do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how we approach it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to one of my students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told her, OK, let's try to see where are
we standing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to repeat the experiment that
these guys did and see what is the point
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took six different types of
cannabis, different types of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we make six different types of
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we choose eight different types of
cancers that we have in our lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are growing the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cell's growing on the plate like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going like confluent on the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cells look like that if you're taking
a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look in the microscope,
cells look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're growing the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we are treating with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look on colon cancer,
you see the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's lower magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just see a structure of the cells
growing on the plate nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add extract number one, all the cells
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add extract number two, all the cells
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add extract number three, nothing
happened to the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I see differences between
different types of cannabis, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: quite exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing, we put really low
amount of extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put one microgram per ml.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're taking rosemary and you
extract the oil from rosemary and you put
[SPEAKER_00]: on cancer cells, then we die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing extrapolation,
how much you need to eat, you need to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 kilogram per day, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not interesting, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing extrapolation of what
you need to take versus cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're reaching one gram, which Deborah
just showed you that it's one joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a good scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you compare it to those that when
we put chemotherapy, like taxol,
[SPEAKER_00]: vincrestin, vimblastin, it's the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the active compounds here are
nanogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very potent material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look on the breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the same results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract number one and two killed the
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the extract number three did nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look on prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we see differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extract number one did nothing to the
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract number two did nothing to the
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract number three killed all the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a specificity between types of
cannabis to a type of cancer, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: very surprising and amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we use it on normal cells,
there is no normal cells growing on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these cells are without cancer
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's much less effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was another surprising result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, OK, extract from strain number
one, scubidoo, and from Mickey Mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you holding in my hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the materials?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the real names.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the materials that really killed
the cells, binding the receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting the cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that there is a laboratory in
Israel that can read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send them the materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came back with five cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I looked on the extract, extract
number two and extract number three was
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same cannabinoid, the same five
cannabinoids that I get to read,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the same percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not good, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in Haifa in the north of Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have Meshulam in the center of
Israel, which is 45 minutes ride in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called Rafi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him, hi, it's David from the
Technion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he called.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rafi start to explain everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, I realized that we are
knowing more than 100 cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we recognize over than 144 different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my extract, I don't have CBD and
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if to be very disappointed,
if Rafi wants to kill me, he also told me
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of terpenes, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 200 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, Lumi Hanush published a
review four months ago, which showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is over 500 different compounds in
the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a scientist, where can I start?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first I realized that we see just the
tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look on THC, CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the story, at least not with
myself, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, in half a year, I went to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in half a year, I hit my hand in the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because unless I know what I'm holding or
giving to the cell, I can't repeat the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't identify what is the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't start to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for half a year, I struggled with this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to do cannabis research,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming back after this half a year to
my laboratory, I decided if we are not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing everything, nobody will help us,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will skip on these slides because
the time is short.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually, people using HPLC,
you need standards to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have today 12 or 13 standards for
cannabinoids from the 144.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not helping us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I will skip a year and a half forward,
and we develop a whole method with
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere, LCMS, GCMS, and other
equipment, this is the method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, my laboratory has the ability to
see all the cannabinoids and all the tear
[SPEAKER_00]: pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, I will show the miserable
students clap for him, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm showing here is a heat map,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see in the line, it's
different names of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can recognize these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see CBD there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other cannabinoids, it's going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a print screen of this heat map,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the row, you can see different
extracts, different strains that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: given in Israel to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a heat map.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see a dark square, the meaning
that this cannabinoid is highly expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is numbers behind everything,
but it's more visual like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and when it's white, it's low
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to show you on this image,
that every strain that a patient gets in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel, it's a different medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how different they are from each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no two strains that look similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have 91 strains in Israel,
I actually have 91 different medicines for
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this without starting to say that in
the winter, they are growing differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will show a little bit of the
results, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just showing you on the blue side,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the mark in blue?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is two high CBD strains, low THC 20
to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the two strains that were
extract 2 and extract 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see how different they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's true that the CBD is very similar,
but all other compounds are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the reason one cell, one extract
killing the cell, and the other is not
[SPEAKER_00]: killing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the same thing with tear pants,
and also it's all around a lot of results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having this ability to see all the
compounds actually did something to my lab
[SPEAKER_00]: that I didn't expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's opened the world to my lab,
because now every girl, every startup,
[SPEAKER_00]: every physician that's doing clinical
trial, coming to my lab and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I want to know what I'm giving to the
patient if it's extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a perfect strain, I saw a guy
outside that's saying that his strain is
[SPEAKER_00]: better than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's coming to my lab, said, OK,
I want to prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read all the cannabinoids that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see if there is different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my lab in the last year grew in an
unexpected way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing today a lot of things,
not just cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have actually four groups in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: One group is doing all the chemist
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're asking, what are the difference
between ethanol extraction, butane
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, and CO2 extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking one strain and doing
butane extraction versus CO2 extraction or
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol extraction, you get a different
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different compound that you get in
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine, THC and CBD are there, but you're
losing cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gaining other tear pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're changing the portfolio totally.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the bioavailability when you
smoke and you're taking a pill?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is reaching to the blood?
[SPEAKER_00]: All this question, we have the ability to
answer while we're knowing to see this
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a group that's doing chemist
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a group that's doing neurobiology,
mainly epilepsy, brain development,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't touch it at all in this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a group that's doing database that
we're collecting data on the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the cannabinoids that they are
taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I speak about it for two minutes,
if I will have the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to show you a few results from
the cancer group.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still the main group in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the cancer, as I told you,
we can grow the cells in a plate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can also grow them in a plate that
have many wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower one called 96 well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every scientist or the physician knows
this plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take glioblastoma or pancreatic
cancer and the same one grow in this
[SPEAKER_00]: plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually can do in one plate 96
different experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do 96 dosages, 96 different
strains, whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have in my lab this machine,
which is known as a high throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is incubator connected to CO2 and
to oxygen and everything that cells need
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a microscope on top of it that
know how to move between the wells and
[SPEAKER_00]: take images.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take over 1,000 images an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have fluorescence, so you can put
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, you get these images to the
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can analyze the images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make the story short.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get in the end a table which will tell
you in which well it was most effective.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: In well C4, you killed 100% of the cells
through apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: While in well D7, nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that way, we can screen a lot of
different dosages or a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts, find the one that is most
potent, and start to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with it for a specific type of
cancer.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm finding something specific,
one strain that killed specific cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: with a specific mutation, I put a PhD
student, and the miserable guy needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: work on these four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the way I did it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we find something like that,
we put a student, and this is his goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to show you a few results that
showing how much complex this area and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't say that cannabis is good for
cancer or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see on top is the images that
we get from this machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that in the left corner,
you see the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put Mike A.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a name of a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's killing all the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And RN doing nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to focus on the graph here with
the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every color, it's a different strain,
extract from a different strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see on this graph is the
percentage of the cells that die.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the extra, you see dosages,
2 micrograms, 4 micrograms, 6 micrograms,
[SPEAKER_00]: 8 micrograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see if we focus on 4 micrograms
per mL, that there are strains that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are A375.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's melanoma cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that in 4 micrograms, there are
strains that are doing nothing to these
[SPEAKER_00]: cells while there are strains that are
killing 50% of the cells and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that are killing most of the
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to show you, you can't say
cannabis is killing the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know which cannabis will kill
these cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look here, you will see that
the gray one is melanoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black one is lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there are strains
that are very good to kill the melanoma by
[SPEAKER_00]: doing nothing to the lung cancer,
as I showed you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I will take it to the next step,
if we look on these cells and we choose
[SPEAKER_00]: one strain, Mike A, OK, which killed 70%
of the cells with 4 micrograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're taking this strain and we've
purified the TIDS and the CBD from this
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now 100%, 98% purified pure THC
from this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same THC, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not synthetic, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to these politics questions.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we purify it and give now to the
cells, you see that even in 8 micrograms
[SPEAKER_00]: of pure THC, which is 20 times more than
we give the extract, look on the green
[SPEAKER_00]: one, which is the A375, it's doing nothing
to the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it also with the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're taking this pure and add it
to the extract, again, it's doing nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the THC and the CBD in these
types of cells.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give another example on prostate
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see in the left side six extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that now it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much the cell survives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see a low body, it's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's killing more cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that extract number one is very
useful by killing the cell, while other
[SPEAKER_00]: extract is not useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will tell you, I know exactly what
the difference to treat cells in mice or
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plate versus a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't learn from this that this is what
you need to treat people that you know.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to do an extrapolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a mind thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on a patient now, and you're
going to pick strains that will help you
[SPEAKER_00]: for prostate cancer, what is the
possibility that you pick the right one?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to be the bad guy a little bit
more.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will tell you that extract number one
and extract number six are the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extract from one strain from the
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We separate it in two.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, we activated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We activate, we heat it to be activated,
to decarboxylate.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other note, strain number one,
extract number one, is without the
[SPEAKER_00]: heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And strain number six is after heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if you're a patient, and you are
very lucky, and you pick the right strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're smoking it, it won't help you,
according to these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you said, OK, David, tell us that
the acid form is better to cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: In glioblastoma, it's not the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: After heating it, it's much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm trying to say, it's still so
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still we know so little that we need
to be very careful to say what is good and
[SPEAKER_00]: not good, what is working and not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to skip everything because I'm red.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to show two things very,
very shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I go back?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show two things very shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it's something that we got last
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a clinical trial that needs to
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to prepare a lot of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew the same strain, the same
genetic, planted in the same day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because they need a lot of material,
they're planting in five different
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four different greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same genetic of the plant just
growing in different greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a problem that we're facing
every time we're getting different
[SPEAKER_00]: materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, I want to say very, very shortly
that the four groups in my lab are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the database that we're doing,
having the knowledge that we are the
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories that know exactly what the
patient is getting from bottom to top,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can follow up on this patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing this database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first aim, we create a cannabis
strain database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every cannabis, every plant or extract
that the patient can get in Israel,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that the patient can get is
coming first to our laboratory,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're doing all the identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your aunt is getting a Mickey Mouse
in December, I know what she got.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: The second arm, we're doing follow up on
all the patients in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting all the data from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We build a questionnaire, and I won't go
into it because of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is to say, OK, these 75
strains increase appetite in 80% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the materials in these 75
strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: That increase appetite that do not exist
in the standard, don't increase appetite,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this to take to clinical trials and
mice model to make it evidence-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, and I'm finished here, show you one
example with the strains of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are treating in Israel 70 kids with
autism, severe autism, and the result of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduces anxiety, reduces violence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more concentrated, more
variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, everything is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mickey Dore mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: A month ago, a month and a half ago,
one day, seven kids flipped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the kids, 17 years old,
beat the shit of his mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other kids, like crazy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got phone calls from the physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to the head of my database
project, Tali, and I tell her,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tali, these are the numbers of the kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Daddy, all these kids are from the
same grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Israel, we have eight authorized
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're voting all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these kids got the extract from the
same grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling the grower and say,
hey, what has been changed today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every kid that gets materials from you,
from autism, is getting crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daddy, everything is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using the same extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 20 to 1 CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling the physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're checking this sample, and we see
that actually the grower changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't lie about that the CBD and
THC stayed 20 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other materials in the strain are
totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see CBGV here, CBGAM, severe
hydroxy CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they're changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I'm looking, because now
I have eight cannabinoids that I suspect
[SPEAKER_00]: are important to reduce anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to say thank you to my students that
are doing the work while I'm giving talks.
Thank you.
