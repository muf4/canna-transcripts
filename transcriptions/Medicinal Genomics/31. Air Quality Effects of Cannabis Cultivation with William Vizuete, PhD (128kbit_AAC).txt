[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to remind everyone that the
healthcare provider study we are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Cannabis Center of Excellence is
still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a healthcare provider,
please take a few minutes to complete the
[SPEAKER_01]: survey to help us better understand
medical cannabis knowledge, attitudes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and practices among healthcare providers
in the US and Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an added incentive, one lucky
participant will win a CanMed 2021
[SPEAKER_01]: practicum and full conference ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: The link to access that survey is in the
show description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, our guest this episode is emissions
and air pollution expert William Vesuete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Vesuete works as the chief scientific
officer for Bayer Scientific, where he
[SPEAKER_01]: analyzes cannabis and hemp plant emissions
and helps develop state-of-the-art order
[SPEAKER_01]: and emission mitigation solutions and
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the past six years, Dr. Vesuete has
led a team of cannabis industry experts
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on site-specific research to
increase the overall knowledge of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry emissions, educate local
communities, and improve the tools and
[SPEAKER_01]: methods that cultivators and policymakers
use to evaluate the environmental impacts
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis cultivation and processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Vesuete is perhaps best known for his
groundbreaking research into cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: emissions and air quality in Denver,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that study, Dr. Vesuete began
creating a first-of-its-kind cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene library.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Vesuete will participate in the expert
panel titled The Hidden Cost of Cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Environmental Impact at CanMed 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topics we discuss in our conversation
include how emissions from cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp plants affect air quality and ozone,
the difference between BVOCs and AVOCs,
[SPEAKER_01]: how the type and concentration of
emissions from cannabis plants can vary
[SPEAKER_01]: widely from strain to strain, why cannabis
cultivators should be concerned with
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling odors from their facilities,
whether terpenes emitted from cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants can taint neighboring wine grapes,
and strategies cultivators can use to
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigate odors and emissions from their
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to my conversation with Dr.
Vesuete, I would like to thank this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode's sponsor, TenBuds.
[SPEAKER_01]: A site dedicated to all things cannabis
with a special focus on growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, TenBuds is packed with
fascinating and informative articles,
[SPEAKER_01]: resources, and reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis growers, enthusiasts,

considerations for cannabis business
[SPEAKER_01]: owners to the evolution of marijuana s
place in society, its health benefits,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit TenBuds.com to learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without any further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Dr. William Vesuete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, Will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are participating in a panel
discussion at CanMed 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all about understanding the
environmental impacts of cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you are an expert specifically
in the area of emissions and air
[SPEAKER_01]: pollution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we can start the conversation
with you explaining how cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation can impact air quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it might be really helpful if
we kind of start with a little bit of some
[SPEAKER_00]: definitions of names and a lot of names
being thrown around, and we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing somewhat technical terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about emissions from these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of folks kind of talk about
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a word that's used quite a
bit, or VOCs is another word that's used
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's define what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a VOC is a volatile organic compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an organic molecule,
so carbons and hydrogens, that at room
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature would rather be in the gas
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we call volatile organic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And volatile organic compounds include
lots and lots of kind of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one important organic molecule is
called isoprene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, isoprene is emitted by every living
thing on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I right now are emitting isoprene
out of our breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've known that for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you take that isoprene and you put
two isoprenes together as a building
[SPEAKER_00]: block, what you end up with is what we
call monoterpenes, which is a class of
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of molecules, including alpha
pionene, delimitene, some of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe your listeners are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put three isoprene molecules
together, you have something that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: sesquiterpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people like to talk about terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about terpene,
there's actually two large classes of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, one's called monoterpenes and
that is called sesquiterpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: isoprene, which is a building block for
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all these VOCs that come from plants,
we call biogenic VOCs or biogenic volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are made from humans that
usually come from gasoline or things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, we call anthropogenic volatile
organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we know in the air quality field
where I come from, all these VOCs,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they're from plants or from
people, can participate in chemistry in
[SPEAKER_00]: the atmosphere and form both ozone and
particulate matter or aerosols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so understanding how these VOCs come
from these plants is just as important as
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding where these VOCs are coming
from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you won't get a full picture of
our air quality is being impacted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how I came about looking at
these VOCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at these emissions of these
terpenes and their impact on air quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you published a pretty
notable study analyzing the air quality in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver, specifically with relation to
cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you could kind of
explain the results of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like I was saying before,
we've known for a long time scientifically
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a connection between these VOCs,
monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and isoprene
[SPEAKER_00]: and the formation of air pollution in the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I should note that, you know,
these molecules by themselves are not
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, most of these things have that,
you know, nice smells and things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've come to become accustomed and
like these sorts of molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being exposed to high levels of
these terpenes is not harmful to human
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you have combustion sources
that are with these VOCs in the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of sunlight, they can form ozone and
particulate matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it actually depends how much existing
VOCs are already in the atmosphere to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how much that really has an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Denver, Colorado, Denver happens to
be high desert, and there happens not to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot of biogenic or VOCs that come
from plants due to its high altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have a city that has lots of
combustion sources, which are the cars,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, from a large metropolitan city,
but is starved.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it only had more of these VOCs,
it could produce more ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other issue with Denver is that
the city of Denver is in near what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: a non-attainment or is in violation of the
federal standard for ambient ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any little bit of ozone contribution is
going to push them in the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's unique about Denver is that it
needs those VOCs, but the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado has also made cannabis production
under secure premises, which has forced a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of cannabis production indoors and
mostly in warehouses, and warehouses are
[SPEAKER_00]: usually located right near major
transportation hubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I wanted to create more ozone in
a place that was starved for VOCs,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would place those VOCs, it's close to,
the transportation centers as I could,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's effectively what has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I saw this and I thought,
well, we need to figure out whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: large enough that it could have an impact
on the regional air quality, because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really what the question is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I wanted to do this for,
say, automobiles or a new power plant or a
[SPEAKER_00]: new gas station, I could go to the EPA
scientists and literature and look up what
[SPEAKER_00]: the emissions would be from burning so
many tons of coal or for burning so much
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel or for decreasing an engine,
and I could look up how much emissions
[SPEAKER_00]: would go into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have existing tools at both
the state of Colorado and the EPA run that
[SPEAKER_00]: could predict its impact on air quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I went to look at this for the
cannabis industry, there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: information available and no emission
factors there to allow me to build an
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory, no information to allow me to
create those inputs into an air quality
[SPEAKER_00]: model to allow me to predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so through a PhD student and some
money from the National Center of
[SPEAKER_00]: Atmospheric Research in the state of
Colorado and some collaborators,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were able to, for the very first time,
measure what these emissions would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: build an inventory for the cannabis
industry for the state of Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then used EPA approved air quality
models to assess its impact on regional
[SPEAKER_00]: air quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to make sure I'm
understanding this correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is the issue, it's not so much the VOCs
that are coming from the plant themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when it's in combination with the
emissions from, like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: combustion or some sort of power plant or
cars or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also need sunlight as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a combination of all three of
those things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so in the atmosphere and so
it also depends, it's a very complex
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, it's so complex that the Clean
Air Act specify specifically that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to use an air quality model to assess
whether your controls are going to work in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future, because there's all this
combination of emissions, chemistry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and meteorology, both winds and sunlight,
all forming together in this really
[SPEAKER_00]: complex nonlinear chemistry that's
occurring in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really difficult, which is why we
run these air quality models, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I couldn't tell you, you know,
just from looking at Denver, just tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: what its impact would be because of all
the interactions with these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also think of indoors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you had these VOCs, you have a
light source, which could be your UV lamps
[SPEAKER_00]: or grow lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any kind of combustion
source or you're bringing in NOx
[SPEAKER_00]: combustion sources from the outside,
you have a possibility of also generating
[SPEAKER_00]: ozone or particulate matter inside your
facility as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VOCs themselves are not toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breathe them in at elevated
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as they mix in certain
combinations with what we call nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: oxides or NOx from combustion sources in
the presence of some sort of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a potential for forming ozone in
particulate matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving forward, will some attention
need to be paid as to where these
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation facilities are placed?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what's nice about this is
that we have the tools to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, anytime somebody wants to
install a new boiler or do a new power
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go for siting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tools that are out there to
predict what the impact on air quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: water quality is going to be if that
facility was put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have those tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: EPA has those tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: The permitting, we have a nice long
history of being able to use these tools
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the input data, is the understanding
how the cultivation of these plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: what the response and temperature and
light and type of strain and life cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: contributes to these emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we have that, then,
yeah, I could we could cite these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could predict its impact on
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about setbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about, you know,
what sort of controls would be required
[SPEAKER_00]: and what those controls would do in the
future if we had this sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of all goes back to if we
understand how these plants behave and
[SPEAKER_00]: what they emit into the atmosphere,
then we can rely on tools that we already
[SPEAKER_00]: have to learn about those impacts on both
air quality, on terpene drift and also on
[SPEAKER_00]: odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes back to understanding what is
being emitted by these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before my publication, there was
absolutely nothing out there on what is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does the emissions from cannabis
compare to other commercially grown crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it turns out, the amount of
emissions that come from plants are as
[SPEAKER_00]: varied and wide as they are species of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an example, an oak tree
emits, oh, I think an order of magnitude
[SPEAKER_00]: higher rates of isoprene than a pecan
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're both trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's wide variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why this has been a subject of
investigation and research by EPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: NOAA and a bunch of other national
laboratories all around the world trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand these emissions from all
these different kinds of plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a nice database of,
you know, other commodity products and
[SPEAKER_00]: other large species of trees because we
have to run those in our air quality
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it comes to cannabis,
as it turns out, they contain a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: similar kinds of what we call mono
terpenes, which is a class of those
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and some sesquiterpenes that we
find in many other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's nothing really unusual as
far as the type of mono terpene that's
[SPEAKER_00]: being emitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the rate, the amount,
the magnitude that's being emitted there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say on average, I mean,
they're not the highest emitting plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've ever seen, but they're also not
the lowest emitting plants that we've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're, you know, about an average
emitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's really interesting about the
cannabis plant, however, that's may or may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be different than other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we've seen in our own analysis is
that the amount, so the rate and the kind,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, the profile of gases of
mono terpenes that are being emitted and
[SPEAKER_00]: sesquiterpenes varies wildly by strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the strain, you could have
a much different amount of mono terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and sesquiterpenes being emitted as well
as kinds of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see differences in the life
cycle, whether it's a juvenile or
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see subtle differences whether
it's grown indoors or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was actually the most
surprising finding I found in my research
[SPEAKER_00]: is how varied widely in composition and
rate among the life cycle and strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that there's not a one size
fits all emission factor in every
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to build an inventory,
it has to do what we call a site
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which specific strains are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What life cycle are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they being grown indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they being grown outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all those things affect the
emission rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we have that information,
then we can build and control,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can have impacts on air quality,
on terpene drift and odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it goes back to understanding
those emissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, it makes complete sense that you
would see a wide variety in the different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see it in every other aspect of the
plant, whether it be the height or the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of the flowers, the amount of the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I imagine that, you know, the emissions
wouldn't be any different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you said that there's a difference in
the concentration and the different types
[SPEAKER_01]: of terpenes or emissions that the plants
are giving off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any molecules specifically that
are more troubling than others?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there a certain combination that's
more a threat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it kind of all the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it kind of depends on the problem
that you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're able to do in our own work
is we can give a full composition or
[SPEAKER_00]: profile, a full characterization of every
single kind of molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of different kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than just the terpenes,
but there's other kinds of molecules that
[SPEAKER_00]: are being emitted by those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the techniques that we have allow
us to measure all those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a good understanding of
almost every molecule that's coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then your question was,
which molecules are the most important?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that depends on the question you're
trying to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if we're looking at
terpene drift, one of the culprits that
[SPEAKER_00]: has been identified as a potential to
taint wine is eucalyptol, which is a type
[SPEAKER_00]: of monoterpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for terpene drift, we would model
eucalyptol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the molecule of question,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we're able to measure all the
molecules, I can say, OK, I know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: how much eucalyptol is coming from each
strain and each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can build an inventory and we can
model eucalyptol going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in air quality,
then it's all the molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, so every single one of those
VOCs can react and potentially form ozone
[SPEAKER_00]: or particulate matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has more to do with the alkene,
where the double bonds are, so the
[SPEAKER_00]: reactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, in our air quality models,
we cheat almost all the monoterpenes the
[SPEAKER_00]: same from a reactivity standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And however, from an odor standpoint,
it's something else altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we seem to find that it's not the
terpenes that are a main driver for the
[SPEAKER_00]: odor, although I think they play a part in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a different molecule that you'd
have to track and follow if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all three of those problems come
down to what's being emitted by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you know which molecules are
emitted by the plant, you can target
[SPEAKER_00]: those, you can model those, and you can
also control specifically for those
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's interesting you bring that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this might be a great way to kind of
pivot into another area that your group is
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned about, which is odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that recently, your team had
either put out a study or a press release,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw the press release about that
you have identified the molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for the skunky odor associated
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you could speak a
little bit more to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, you know, there's been a lot of
work trying to understand odor impacts,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a community issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's one that, you know,
responsible cultivation owners should keep
[SPEAKER_00]: an eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also something that's coming down
the pike with regulations, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's there already, or coming,
it's happening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so understanding this odor issue has
become a focus of our research in our
[SPEAKER_00]: company for some time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been able to collaborate with
some really interesting folks who have
[SPEAKER_00]: also been in the odor space, but in other
industries, not necessarily in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, like I think landfills
and meat rendering facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so working closely with these folks,
including Iowa State University,
[SPEAKER_00]: we and our own techniques and our ability
to fully characterize the profile of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plans, we use both odor experts and
high-end analytical equipment to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what we think might be ultimately
driving a large source of the objective
[SPEAKER_00]: odor of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the compound we found was this
thing called 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol,
[SPEAKER_00]: or 3-2-1-MBT.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a type of thiol, so it's a
sulfur-containing compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were able to identify that,
and we've seen that in other industries as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that's just kind of the
beginning, because you're seeing all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of other molecules that are also there as
well in addition to the MBT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not quite clear how the
interaction between those terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: thiols impact our perception of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's just the start here that
we've been able to identify what we think
[SPEAKER_00]: might be one of the objectable molecules,
that it makes a lot more sense in assuming
[SPEAKER_00]: the monoterpenes were driving odor,
which didn't make sense just from smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: monoterpenes on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have that odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these thiols, it seemed to make more
sense to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so currently, since we're able to
identify the kind of molecules there are,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to adapt our control mitigation
strategies to really go after those sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of molecules and prevent them from leaving
the facility at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wondered if you could speak more to
the issue of odor in regards to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation facilities in general,
what is sort of the risk to cultivators if
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't have their odor under control?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm not an odor expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't talk about, you know,
for example, are there medical issues
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with odor?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not going to speak on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know it's a nuisance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the very minimal, people are
not happy when they're smelling that odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's strong odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it carries a very, very long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on how you're growing,
I mean, we've seen even juvenile strains
[SPEAKER_00]: have odor issues, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I was saying that even
juveniles and mature plants have different
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles and different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sometimes we come across a juvenile
that may have a higher, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: emission rate, and those are stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have at any point in time
from your facility, you know, 24-7 odor
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, you know, you know,
I've heard enough communities who are next
[SPEAKER_00]: to these facilities who are being impacted
by these odors to know that it affects
[SPEAKER_00]: your quality of life, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't, you have to close up your
windows and doors, you know, and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people do suffer, you know, physical,
you know, impacts as a result of
[SPEAKER_00]: continuously smelling that odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a good neighbor policy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to be next to something that
stinks really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it brings a lot of attention and
issues to a facility that might normally,
[SPEAKER_00]: might try to be doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that odor, it puts all
kinds of scrutiny on the facility's
[SPEAKER_00]: operation and what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may have the best intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's a naturally
occurring process that comes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's really no way to get around
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to control for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should strive for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be a good neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're going to get the
scrutiny of not just the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned regulators and I think you
mentioned it earlier too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have there been any, you know,
regulatory actions in terms of requiring
[SPEAKER_01]: that cultivation facilities control their
odor or is that still coming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so, you know, the thing with the
legalization of recreational and medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana is that it's really a patchwork
kind of place across the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no federal and even within the
states, sometimes the counties have
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways of doing or approaching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, are there places that are
regularly saying that you can't do odor
[SPEAKER_00]: from a county?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there places that don't have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I've seen that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there places where it's exempt?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, it's considered agricultural
and therefore it doesn't have an odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's all across the board,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also depends on where the facility
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an indoor grow like in Denver,
there's more likelihood that there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: next door to residential communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's grown outdoor on a farm,
you know, maybe their neighbor is a
[SPEAKER_00]: vintner and not a, you know, community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they're more interested in
the odor from their tasting room than they
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, from a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's always, you know, again,
just like the strains and how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: site-specific, I think dealing with this
odor issue is also a site-specific thing
[SPEAKER_00]: because our approaches are different
depending whether you're an indoor grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: an outdoor grow, a hoop house,
you know, all these things require kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: different approaches for control
mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if you understand the rates and
what's coming out of your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're already halfway there in
trying to combat that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what are some of the solutions that
you've developed in terms of controlling
[SPEAKER_01]: odor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Bioscientific has a number of
equipment that's available for mitigation
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this includes combinations of,
you know, filtration systems where we
[SPEAKER_00]: sequester odor molecules, so molecular
scrubbing, which uses carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our patent vapor phase system
that uses waterless vapor technology and
[SPEAKER_00]: that controls some of these kind of what
we call fugitive odors, odors that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: leak out or that aren't, you know,
effectively mitigated by a molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration system, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, with a combination of
those two things, that allows us to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: very good success for not only capturing,
you know, preventing the majority of it
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving enclosed facilities, but also
allowing us to deal with facilities that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't enclosed that aren't conducive to,
for example, carbon control, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and then we use what we call
coconut shell carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these are camphill coconut shell
carbon canisters that we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an option to include
photocatalytic oxidation as another means
[SPEAKER_00]: of reducing some of the organics,
if you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's in that system that allows us
to, you know, mitigate these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it also allows us to
capture the VOCs that may contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: turpentine drift or may contribute to air
quality impacts as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, are these air filters that are sort of
incorporated into the HVAC system?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so each, so we do onsite
solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it depends on the system that,
you know, it depends on how you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: or how you want us to be putting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, I mean, eventually what we want
to provide is, so what the emission rates
[SPEAKER_00]: allows you to quantify is what exactly is
the breeding rate of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they breeding out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what amount is that happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, with that information,
we can size our instrumentation and our
[SPEAKER_00]: flow rates to capture what it breathes
out, we breathe in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No more, no less, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to do more because you're
just wasting energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to do less because that'll
lead to a violation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we work with the facility to make
either an integral bar to the HVA system
[SPEAKER_00]: as a standalone process or however it
works best with the facility that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what about outdoor facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that's going to be quite the
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so that's where we have our vapor
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, it's called a stationary vapor
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quiet and it creates, it's a mist,
but it's an invisible mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can't really see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has, and that creates kind of,
you know, like a curtain, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, when the emissions from the
facilities hit this kind of curtain,
[SPEAKER_00]: it mitigates a lot and eliminates the
odors from going downwind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in places where you can't control with
carbon, right, which is like an open farm
[SPEAKER_00]: or things like that, you can control with
some of these vapor systems that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been able to do outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've been successful in mitigating
odors both in indoor, outdoor grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of mixed grows as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, do you essentially set up a perimeter
around the grow and that sort of creates
[SPEAKER_01]: that curtain so that if any molecules
interact with that, they're sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: neutralized?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did mention terpene drift as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that you all were involved
in a lawsuit where I think it was a wine
[SPEAKER_01]: producer who was claiming terpene drift
from a nearby cannabis facility was
[SPEAKER_01]: tainting their grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I have that correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, I wonder if you could speak a
bit to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we were definitely involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, that was the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It continues to be a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, they asked us to kind of
investigate and research that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we developed a scientific way of
trying to quantify the amount of material
[SPEAKER_00]: that would end up and whether it would or
would not taint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let me just back up a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's a published literature out
there that has shown that eucalyptol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a type of terpene and a terpene
that is emitted in the gas phase by the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, some cannabis plants,
not all of them, by the way, but some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eucalyptol has been found when it
makes its way into the wine process,
[SPEAKER_00]: has tainted the wine and the taste of the
wine, ruining the wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, this is a known thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, things when you have vineyards that
are near eucalyptol trees, by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get eucalyptol leaves as part of
the harvesting, those leaves make it
[SPEAKER_00]: through the processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a large amount of eucalyptol
oil that ends up in your wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, when it was found out that
eucalyptol is a molecule that is emitted
[SPEAKER_00]: by some of these cannabis plants,
then the question became, is it in
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient quantities that it could taint
the grape tissue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how do you find that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, like I have been saying this
whole podcast, it goes back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you know how much eucalyptol is
being emitted by these plants or a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, you could input that into an air
quality model that uses local meteorology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could then predict where those
eucalyptol molecules end up and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how many of those end up
at the vineyard in question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can predict what the
concentration of that eucalyptol would be
[SPEAKER_00]: outside that grape tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could predict, okay,
well, of that gas phase eucalyptol,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how much that's absorbed by the
grape tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be the amount of eucalyptol
in your grape tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could compare that to the
other studies that showed taint and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much material they had in their grape
tissues and see how close we would get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we did is we went onsite,
or rather, this was a, I take that back,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was a facility that was being
proposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there was nothing onsite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what they did was they told us which
strains that they were going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went to our other various
kinds of contacts in the business and we
[SPEAKER_00]: did our own measurements and developed
leaf enclosure measurements and developed
[SPEAKER_00]: emission factors for those proposed
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility told us how many plants they
were going to build and we built an
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we took three years of neurological
data from the closest weather station was
[SPEAKER_00]: at the proposed site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ran three years of model
simulations using that meteorology and
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted the worst case kind of
concentrations at the location of the
[SPEAKER_00]: existing vineyard, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said, okay, of that,
this is how much of it would deposit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is how long it would take at
that rate under the worst conditions of
[SPEAKER_00]: meteorology for it to equal what was
published for taint.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, I don't have the numbers in
front of me, unfortunately, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was something on the order of a couple
years for the amount that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted to get to levels that were seen
in other publications as far as taint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of what we ended up
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes sense if you think about it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the difference between what has
been reported is that eucalyptal leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: which contain pools of oil of eucalyptal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a large amount of eucalyptal
when you're in that concentrated oil form,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's coming off the cannabis is in the
volatilized form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the gas phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't want, it's hard for them to
go back into a liquid phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they're volatilized and they're
in the gas phase, they tend to stay in the
[SPEAKER_00]: gas phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have some that's being emitted,
some that makes it over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: some that makes it on the grape tissue,
but just not at really measurable
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the predictions and the
data told us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this example, it's good news,
terpene drift is not tainting any grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other potential scenarios
where terpene drift potentially could be
[SPEAKER_01]: an issue for other agricultural crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so I'm not sure because I'm not in
that area where what sort of terpene may
[SPEAKER_00]: be harmful to what sort of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing we've heard about is wine
and specifically eucalyptal and maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple others that have been shown in the
literature, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why that's an issue right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's still several things that
we don't know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for example, we have this library
of emissions factors from these strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just in the state of Colorado alone,
there's 600 plus different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of strains, but nowhere
approaching the order of hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still a lot of uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just within the strains that we have,
we see some plants with no eucalyptal
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions and some with, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of uncertainty just
in the emission factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's uncertainty as to how
much is too much taint, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this number that we got from this
other study, but that's a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the minimum amount?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the threshold value?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the target?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's still kind of an unknown thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of research that still
needs to be done to really understand
[SPEAKER_00]: whether this is an issue or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what I've seen and my gut tells
me is that since these things are volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: and given the amount of emission rates
that we see, it's something that we should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably model and look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just from the data that I've seen so
far, it may not be a huge, huge issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not something that's really surprising or
really popping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unless we have some data, we can't
quantify these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't predict these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to answer these questions
with some real data and some real science
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we have an understanding of
whether things are an issue or not and to
[SPEAKER_00]: what extent they're an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, those models were done
with no controls, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we had controls in that
facility, even less eucalypti would make
[SPEAKER_00]: it over to the vintner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, I don't know if you remember
me saying this earlier, but these
[SPEAKER_00]: monoturpenes like to react in the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle of the day, they have an
atmospheric collapse time of a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not just hanging around in the
middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually reacting away pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing that we didn't
assume in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a very conservative upper bound
concentration and we still didn't even get
[SPEAKER_00]: near what we would think would be shocking
levels of eucalypti on the grape tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny, I've been doing this
podcast for over a year now, and I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you how many times guests have said,
we just don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still so much we need to
learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just such a common refrain in this
industry, which is what makes it so
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating, so exciting and why we love
doing this conference.
