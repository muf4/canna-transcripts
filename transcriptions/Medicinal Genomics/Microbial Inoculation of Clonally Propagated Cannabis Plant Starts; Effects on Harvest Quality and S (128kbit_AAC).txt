[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming and seeing my talk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everybody had a good lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So microbial inoculation of clonally
propagated plant starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I consider this more of a
white paper just so I think everybody in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room needs to be informed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're non scholar, you know,
really honored to be here in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this facility with this crowd and,
you know, this audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really have a passion for cannabis and
the scholarly side of it is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we really just have enjoyed as a fan base
and really using those as tools to advance
[SPEAKER_00]: our learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So appreciate everybody in this room and
this community a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Daniel Hendricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the co-founder and CEO of Hendricks
Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a cannabis clone nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're located in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four operating partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the founders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're born in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a commercial nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we create clonal starts
for other businesses in specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County, but all around
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our annual license right there in
the beautiful redwood rainforest of
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County and people have rather
enjoyed our services and we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our community and that's kind of how
we discovered this opportunity to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: research into how we can maybe contribute
to a better product and just a more
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally sound cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Humboldt County, it's the redwood
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycelium connects all of these trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to talk and communicate with
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do is they signal to each other,
you know, pathogens, nutrient exchange,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of really amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So underneath our feet is this web of
really intelligent, you know, bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: biotechnical applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how trained everybody is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everybody has a really strong
understanding of some of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm going to go over it anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give some general terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rhizobacteria are root colonizing
bacteria that form symbiotic relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: with many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other industries, this is a really
common application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria,
PGPRs have been reported to support plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, suppress plant diseases,
and increase the yield productivity of
[SPEAKER_00]: many crop-producing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all other agricultural industries,
this is really common.
[SPEAKER_00]: They inoculate their crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see different kind of agricultural
results and, you know, the term plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth promoting rhizobacteria is just an
attractive, you know, acronym.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see our plants perform better,
and maybe this is a good opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to discover how.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, non-scholar, the way I was
introduced to these kind of concepts,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, was from Jeff Lowenfels and
Elaine Ingram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I worked in the cannabis
industry as a pot grower, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was around 2014 I started to get my
curiosity going about what other types of
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, what other industries could
help influence the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I believed legalization was going
to have a major impact, and that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to be a big part of our economic
success in California, in the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: in our community, and humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept of the soil food web is,
to me, common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the big things eat the smaller
things, and specifically, right there at
[SPEAKER_00]: that bacterial point, you know,
the bacteria are able to digest and make
[SPEAKER_00]: more available all of these amazing,
you know, phosphates, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient supply that's already there in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bacteria is able to break that down
and deliver it to your rhizosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: to your roots, to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that is amazingly interesting,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to introduce to this concept,
and here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working at Daisy's Supply in Humboldt
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sourcing nutrients for other farmers
on the emergence of legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that came a lot of companies
wanting to introduce their new products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody had a new product and a new
solution that was going to recreate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, and one of the most interesting
that I encountered back then was this
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria rhodocytomonas palustris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rhodocytomonas palustris is a
gram-negative, non-sulfur, purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: rodent, rod-shaped bacterium found both in
aerobic and anaerobic environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means it can survive without
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That alone is a pretty exceptional
testament to this bacteria's strength,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to use it in cannabis,
well, we wanted to find out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was this product that was being
used in the agricultural industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our customers started to attract to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to use this bacterial
inoculant, and they were claiming these
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing results.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bacteria has potential for
bio-remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks down waste in polluted
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can produce hydrogen as a result of
nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen fixation is pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can fix nitrogen and create that
nitrogen to make it available to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces ATP, which the plant uses as
energy, and it has the capacity and the
[SPEAKER_00]: capability to fix carbon dioxide as a
biomass through photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was what really struck me as
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bacteria, you know, is able to absorb
parts of the light spectrum that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant really only needs, is they only
able to absorb that central portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: light spectrum right there in the visible
light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bacteria, they're able to convert
infrared or ultraviolet light and use it
[SPEAKER_00]: as an energy or a food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rhodocytomonas palustris was able to
use that energy, infrared and ultraviolet,
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed their food source and fix carbon
out of carbon dioxide, out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your plant doesn't have to expend
energy to fix carbon when rhodocytomonas
[SPEAKER_00]: palustris is doing it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your plant may use that energy to
produce biomass, produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this struck me as really interesting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as most ag products enter the market,
there's not a lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this ag product, this company saw an
opportunity in cannabis, and they made a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis specific product, which was a
diluted rhodocytomonas palustris,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had a consortium of bacillus,
other things, and they suggested a
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatic increase in the usage of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of those moments where I
froze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I don't see any evidence why we
should be increasing the usage of this
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria so drastically just for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like that was kind of a ploy to use
the product more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to see some studies being
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2014, I took a break from the
product, but I continued to take an
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in what advanced enhancements
were being made in cannabis that might
[SPEAKER_00]: help justify use of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the papers written that I really
enjoyed by Max Winston and a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: other authors, they published it in
Chicago, but the studies were done here in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, understanding cultivar
specificity and soil determinants of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rhizosphere, what Max and his
colleagues were able to establish is that
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere bacteria will colonize root
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's a great start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that cannabis and the rhizosphere
bacteria will actually colonize in the
[SPEAKER_00]: area and also move into the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a study with Sour Diesel,
Bucucush, Burmese cultivars, Maui Waui,
[SPEAKER_00]: and White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the objective was to understand how
that soil bacterial presence was gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed into the plant if there was a
synergy or a capability there and what
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that might have on potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he discovered was that the
composition of the soil and the cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: specificity determine the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what cultivar or clone you might use is
gonna determine what bacteria the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: allows to come out of the soil and become
part of the actual colonized, the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular root tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: He discovered that cannabinoid
concentration in composition was
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly correlated with the
structure of the endorhizo community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he found is certain bacterial
presence in the soil were also associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with certain cannabinoid concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really interesting stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the bacteria in the soil are gonna
help us determine what our potencies might
[SPEAKER_00]: be, what other terpene or cannabinoid
profiles might be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the composition of the endorhizo
communities also suggested root decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in one of his studies, he wasn't able
to get to the endorhizo root tissue until
[SPEAKER_00]: eight weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weren't sure how that overall affected
some of his results, but a really great
[SPEAKER_00]: paper, open source, really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four years later, Mary Ann Scott published
in the Canadian Journal of Microbiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with a number of other of her
colleagues at McGill University,
[SPEAKER_00]: published this paper, Endophytes of
Industrial Hemp, Cannabis Sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivars, Identification of Culturable
Bacteria and Fungi in Leaves, Petals,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these hemp cultivars, Yvonne,
CRS-1, Onca, they took the plant tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: from the leaves, petals, and seed embryos
and did an analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to see what was there and what
was present.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was present naturally in this hemp
cultivar's natural microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they discovered was really
interesting and also caught my eye
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about this rotus pseudomonas
palustris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 44% of the natural microbiome in the
leaves were pseudomonas and 16% were
[SPEAKER_00]: bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the petals, 39% were pseudomonas as
well as a presence of bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacillus made up 18% of the seeds and we
actually didn't see as much pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_00]: within the seed embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, like I said, I'm not a scholar,
I look at this and I say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a tremendous opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If naturally the microbiome already is
made up of this pseudomonas taxa,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we probably have a good opportunity
to see that it might adhere and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: colonize the cannabis root tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest abundance of bacterial strains
isolated from leaves were isolates of
[SPEAKER_00]: pseudomonas and bacillus respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a quote from Mary Ann Scott's paper
and there's a phyllo tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you can't see anything,
but that does show all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: species and strains that are present
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most frequently isolated endophytes
belong to the gram-negative genre
[SPEAKER_00]: pseudomonas, 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Pantoea, 17% and the gram-positive
genre is Staphylococcus, 16% and bacillus,
[SPEAKER_00]: 9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I read this and I'm getting
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of a product that needs more
research done on it and really we wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: see this kind of synergy at our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at this table here,
we have several bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the bacteria genuses
that were present in this stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these different biochemical
applications, cellulase, phosphatase,
[SPEAKER_00]: ACN, siderophore production, organic acid
production, we see that pseudomonas,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can get this to work, has a presence
of all of these different biochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a positive association there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacillus, oops, looks like I went to the
next screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacillus was able to be really efficient
here at this phosphorus conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the most powerful clues
for me that, hey, this might have an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect downstream with flower development
and flower potency efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this paper, she establishes there's
an immense abundance of pseudomonas and
[SPEAKER_00]: bacillus in the natural microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me feel like this is maybe a
good opportunity to try these different
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculants and also ethically,
it feels like I'm not introducing anything
[SPEAKER_00]: too foreign.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's already common
within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her study also used only hemp cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a THC cannabis clone producer,
I was curious, does this work with THC or
[SPEAKER_00]: is this only a CBD hemp cultivar
application?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another study done in 2018 that
is not open access, so I didn't share a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot from it there, but it also further
established that phenolahemp was highly
[SPEAKER_00]: receptive to PGPRs in seedling form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in their study, they inoculated
seedlings, found that those bacteria were
[SPEAKER_00]: easily able to colonize the vascular root
tissue and establish a presence within the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that they were able to
establish, it was that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant cannabinoid increase,
that the plants that were inoculated with
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacteria had a cannabinoid increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, I think that is really powerful
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our big concept, PGPRs can increase
yield and secondary metabolites of other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this same true for medical cannabis
cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was our moment to say,
okay, how can we contribute and how can we
[SPEAKER_00]: make our product better for our farmers
down the line?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took one of our clones and we
introduced a cannabis root inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went back and we had the opportunity
now to test this product that so many
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago hadn't been tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see, let's see if the results
can match the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So naturally, like I said, we saw a
tremendous justification for using
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudomonas and Bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudomonas palustris has been inoculated
in grain and demonstrated a 9% yield
[SPEAKER_00]: increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be something that would be
really beneficial to our farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 9% yield increase affects your bottom
line and that's really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium,
and Bacillus lechinformis, they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: able to promote plant root health and
stimulate root hairs, cells, increase
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient acquisition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our experiment, we took the product,
Symthreotic Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a product that I said had been
built specifically for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to see if any of these
claims of the productivity in other crops
[SPEAKER_00]: could be applied to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made three inoculums.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a control with no treatment at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a one ounce per gallon,
which was the minimum suggestion on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a one quarter ounce per
gallon suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Finola experiment, we also saw that
there was a max point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you can use too much of an inoculant,
in which case their results demonstrated
[SPEAKER_00]: that yield and potency actually might go
down if it's used in excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we are at Rambling Rose Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another licensed producer in
Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's up here on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can see the Humboldt County
outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we're located, Humboldt
County, Northern California, Rambling
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose, as well as the producers of this
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's CC with Symbiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all sitting there pondering the
potential of these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of us were blind to the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only had one person at our facility
that knew which batch was inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had no clue which batch contained
the inoculant, which ones were the
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's us taking some of the sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually not the official
sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some early sampling tests as well,
just to compare the lower and the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant seed, different kind of potency
results as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results were really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw positive results across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to demonstrate right here,
lower twin X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the highest total harvest,
had the highest trim weight, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest flower weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower twin Z had the lowest total harvest
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower twin Y and lower twin Z was second
with 5,375 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here is the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower twin X, overall combined potency THC
and THCA was 17.97.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower twin Y, 15.27.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lower twin Z, 14.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we would hope that this would help
us clue in that maybe lower twin X was the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that contained the inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the overall weight that
combines trim and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a bar graph of the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yes, we find that 17.97,
this highest potency, was lower twin X.
[SPEAKER_00]: This received the highest inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower twin Y, 15.27.
[SPEAKER_00]: That received the one quarter ounce
inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the minimum strength inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this was the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really nice cascading graph there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really pleasing, especially to
the farmer who got an 18.75 increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and THCA combined versus his control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And found an overall harvest yield
increase demonstrated significant 9.9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine these kind of results
scaled across an entire acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we should get so lucky as to be able to
repeat something like this, that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the other things that come up
in this discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found an increased yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found an increased potency in our
test trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't anticipate that this is going
to be uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to need lots of other studies
to verify this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so many other potentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that in the tobacco industry,
they've been using rotosunomonas to test
[SPEAKER_00]: its validity as an inoculant to prevent
TMV, tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after our paper was published in
Testing and Terpene Magazine, another
[SPEAKER_00]: paper was printed in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further exemplifying that we need more
research on specifically these two
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dongmai Liu, excuse me for
mispronouncing his name if I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote this paper along with his
colleagues, Plant Growth Promoting
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhizobacteria for Cannabis Production,
Yield, Cannabinoid Profile, and Disease
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just immediately leapt off the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it worried that he'd beat me to all
of my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was actually just helping us
justify further that research needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done specifically on these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the potential role of PGPR is focused
on two genre, pseudomonas and bacillus in
[SPEAKER_00]: his paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he predicted that it will achieve
higher yields, have more desirable
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid profiles, as well as disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Growth Promoting, this is the same
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biological control and disease
resistance associated with PGPRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew and blight control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these things are virtually
unexplored in cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bacterial inoculants may have very
powerful defense mechanisms against crop
[SPEAKER_00]: damage that everyone in this industry is
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see this as just further
justification that the small bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: research that we've done needs to go a lot
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could potentially, you know,
affect more than just our yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may affect the overall health and
disease control within the industry as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has capabilities, potential,
you know, as a plant pathogen defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhodocinnamonus palestris has been
researched as a plant defense and
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrol induction of plant resistance
of tobacco mosaic virus infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be really powerful knowing
that this tobacco mosaic virus right now
[SPEAKER_00]: is causing problems within the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be great to see some defense
mechanisms against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have a huge environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar crops inoculated have
demonstrated higher yield with less water
[SPEAKER_00]: and less fertilizer usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhodocinnamonus has the potential to
retain moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during those drought periods,
crops tend to have a lot less stress and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot less stress effects based on the fact
that the bacteria are able to retain the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture within their own body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they die, they release that
moisture back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it helps mitigate stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, quality and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, pseudomonas and bacillus
inoculate has potential as an affordable
[SPEAKER_00]: and environmentally friendly application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, all we had to do in order to
see these results in the field was make a
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very small, maybe two gallon batch
of this inoculant and just submerge the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and the root tissue in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never went out and inoculated in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never did anything different with any
of those crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we had was this single stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the farmer didn't have to do anything
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what an amazing, you know,
potential result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really appreciate you guys coming
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some gelato grown by Rambling Rose
Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a wonderful and beautiful job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions or you'd
like to get a hold of me, there's my
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody has any questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know in California, you don't have to
test for total aerobic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: But have you tested to see if this
increase in microbials will artificially
[SPEAKER_04]: inflate total testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been asking some of the testing
companies if they're able to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: between, you know, plant growth promoting
bacteria and, you know, potential harmful
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not really something that
they're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely something that we all need
to take a look at.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, to her point, a lot of the testing
labs are doing plating, at least where I
[SPEAKER_03]: come from in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And plating is notorious because I can't
tell the difference not only between
[SPEAKER_03]: bacterial strains, but even live and dead
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's caused a big issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it would behoove you to have
really a ready answer for whether possibly
[SPEAKER_03]: this bacteria could, in fact, cause a
failure in a test to take place,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's an important question.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my question is really, when you're
applying this inoculant, do you have any
[SPEAKER_03]: notion of the degradation period of the
bacteria?
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, like how long after
exposure is the bacteria going to be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Soluble without being degraded?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know that the product that we
use guarantees a shelf stability for 18
[SPEAKER_00]: months before you open the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you open the lid,
it guarantees another six months before
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacteria starts to degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, they stabilize it in a
liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by having it in a liquid,
they're able to actually have the
[SPEAKER_00]: community feed and continue to grow while
it's on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that ultimately, we have to
take a much more scientific approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer some of those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those bacterias need to be
individually studied, and different
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of those consortiums need to
be analyzed so we can actually try and
[SPEAKER_00]: determine what bacteria are even
contributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd love to work with any of the
intelligent minds in this room and at this
[SPEAKER_00]: facility to help answer those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, let me say I thought it was an
excellent bit of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question for you is, do you have
research plans going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we've framed those plans
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we kind of put this together as
a white paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even really necessarily think
that it was going to be something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd even develop into this, you know,
kind of a publication or this kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, we,
like I said, being non-scholars,
[SPEAKER_00]: we really want to look to the community to
see, well, what weaknesses, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: are we presenting here in our approach,
and how can we make it better?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're open to suggestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Dr. Roger Kern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a plant scientist and microbiologist,
originally out of UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to sit down and just talk with
you about where you see things going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk to root exudates as far as a
mechanism for stimulating the ribosome to
[SPEAKER_02]: be more productive for the release of
nutrients back into the root system?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I definitely enjoy, you know,
all the literature, but I wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm qualified to actually answer
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
